      forever, but their popularity has\nsignificantly increased in the past few years,
      also thanks to platforms\nsuch as [Ghost](https://ghost.org/){rel=\"noreferrer\"},\n[Medium](https://medium.com/){rel=\"noreferrer\"},
      and\n[Substack](https://substack.com/){rel=\"noreferrer\"}. Which of course\nalso
      includes science newsletters.\n\n## Failure of advertising as a revenue model\n\nThe
      most important driver of this trend is probably the realization that\nadvertising
      is a poor revenue model for content published on the web,\nincluding blogs.
      Even more so for science content, which seldom draws a\nlot of traffic but rather
      typically caters to small, fragmented\ncommunities. This trend is only aggravated
      by the development of\ntargeted advertising platforms and technologies, which
      don\\''t respect\nthe users\\'' privacy and in turn led to legislation such
      as GDPR\n([General Data Protection\nRegulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation){rel=\"noreferrer\"}),\nimplemented
      in the European Union in May 2018.\n\n## Failure of Twitter and social media\n\nA
      direct consequence of this *rat race* around advertising revenue and\nuser privacy,
      made worse by a pandemic that dramatically changed how we\ninteract online,
      is that social media are seeing the biggest changes in\nmore than 10 years.
      Twitter changed ownership 12 months ago and is no\nlonger *the* place to communicate
      science, including finding out about\nnew publications, science events, or science
      blog posts. One side effect\nof this development is that\n[altmetrics](https://altmetrics.org/manifesto/){rel=\"noreferrer\"}
      have\nstopped being useful. Scientists have dramatically [reduced their use
      of\nTwitter](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02554-0){rel=\"noreferrer\"}\nor
      have moved to other social media platforms. And the visibility of\nposts on
      the platform formerly known as Twitter is now determined mainly\nby [algorithmic\nfeeds](https://indieweb.org/algorithmic_feed){rel=\"noreferrer\"}
      rather\nthan their users. Facebook/Meta and Reddit have similar issues, and
      this\nis related to private organizations owning and controlling most popular\nsocial
      media platforms.\n\n## Newsletters as an alternative\n\nNewsletters provide
      an [interesting\nalternative](https://ghost.org/resources/how-to-make-money-blogging/){rel=\"noreferrer\"}\nto
      advertising and \\\"traditional\\\" social media. They are particularly\npromising
      for science blogs, as they can be easily combined with\nblogging platforms.
      Either as a single platform as with Ghost (used by\nthis blog), Substack, or
      Medium, or integrated with the blogging\nplatform, as several science blogs
      participating in Rogue Scholar are\ndoing.\n\nNewsletters can provide a revenue
      source that is more sustainable than\nadvertising, and they reach users directly
      rather than depending on\nsocial media which currently are undergoing major
      changes.\n\n## The problems with newsletters\n\nNewsletters are not without
      problems. The biggest challenge I see is\nthat they make it very easy to lock
      content behind a paywall. Which does\nnot align well with the overall trend
      toward Open Access and scholarly\ncontent that is free to read and reuse.\n\nAnother
      challenge is that email is not always the best medium for\nscholarly communication.
      Email is fine for occasional newsletters, but\ndoesn\\''t really scale well.
      There are good reasons we have RSS readers\nand social media, and depending
      on newsletters only feels like a\nregression to how we communicated in the early
      1990s.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nNewsletters are an evolving format that can nicely
      integrate with\nscience blogs. For science blogs, it is important that the content\nremains
      free to read and reuse (ideally using a CC-BC license), and that\nthe content
      remains also available via RSS feed and web page. This\napproach aligns with
      the [Principles of Open Scholarly\nInfrastructure](https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H){rel=\"noreferrer\"}:\n\n>
      **Revenue based on services, not data**\u00a0-- data related to the running\n>
      of the research enterprise should be a community property. Appropriate\n> revenue
      sources might include value-added services, consulting, API\n> Service Level
      Agreements or membership fees.\n\nFront Matter is offering two newsletters:\n\n-
      The **Front Matter newsletter** distributes the blog posts of this\n  blog,
      which currently focus on the Rogue Scholar science blog service\n  and related
      topics. Recommended for all bloggers participating in the\n  Rogue Scholar service.
      You can subscribe\n  [here](https://blog.front-matter.io/){rel=\"noreferrer\"}.\n-
      The **Syldavia Gazette newsletter** publishes summaries of interesting\n  science
      blog posts found on the web, including an automated weekly\n  digest of new
      blog posts archived in the Rogue Scholar science blog\n  archive over the past
      seven days. You can subscribe\n  [here](https://syldavia-gazette.org/){rel=\"noreferrer\"}.\n\nOver
      the last two days I have reorganized the Front Matter newsletters\ninto one
      technical newsletter (Front Matter) and one journalistic\nnewsletter (Syldavia
      Gazette). In the process, I had to move the\nexisting subscriptions around.
      Please unsubscribe if you now receive a\nFront Matter newsletter you no longer
      wish to receive.\n\nThe new format of the Syldavia Gazette newsletter (including
      the weekly\nRogue Scholar digest) poses an interesting problem best described
      in the\nmovie *Ghostbusters*:\n\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://media.tenor.com/2YAgdU9Ifo8AAAAC/dont-cross-the-streams-ghostbusters.gif\"\nclass=\"kg-image\"
      loading=\"lazy\" width=\"498\" height=\"206\" />\n</figure>\n\nRogue Scholar
      automatically archives all blog posts of participating\nscience blogs. If the
      Syldavia Gazette publishes digests of Rogue\nScholar blog posts, this could
      lead to an interesting loop. The solution\nwas to implement a new feature in
      Rogue Scholar to only archive some\nblog posts using a filter. This of course
      is also useful for other use\ncases discussed several times where only some
      posts should be included\nin Rogue Scholar, archived, and assigned a DOI.\n\n##
