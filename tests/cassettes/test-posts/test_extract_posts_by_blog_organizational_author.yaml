      December, UNESCO published the first global report on the trends of Open Science
      (OS). In this blog post, the main findings are highlighted: OS is increasing
      but does so unevenly and its monitoring is mainly focused on outputs, missing
      potential progress in participation and dialogue.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3><strong>A value-led perspective
      on Open Science</strong></h3><p>In 2021, UNESCO approved its <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Open Science</a> (OS). By signing this recommendation,
      193 countries made a commitment to support the development of OS with a vision
      of <a href=\"https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/\"
      target=\"_blank\">science as a global public good</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>According
      to this vision, science is only genuinely \u201Copen\u201D when it embraces
      some core values and principles, as illustrated in Figure 1. These include transparency,
      reproducibility and integrity, as generally claimed in OS frameworks, but also
      equity, fairness, diversity and inclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute
      to collective benefits, which are less often invoked in OS policies. </p><p></p><figure

      Science.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Findings of the Outlook: more Open
      Science, but unevenly distributed</strong></h3><div><span class=\"caption\"></span><p>Two
      years after the signature of the OS Recommendation, the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO OS Outlook</a> is the first (pilot) global monitoring
      exercise on the progress of OS according to this value-led perspective. (<em>Note
      that the UNESCO OS Outlook will be introduced by Dr. Tiffany Straza in a CWTS
      webinar <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook\"
      target=\"_blank\">on 2<sup>nd</sup> February, 2024, 15:00-16.15 CET</a>).</em></p><p>The
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards \u201Copen\u201D (i.e. accessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA) publications is quickly increasing;
      the Outlook shows evidence of more sharing of datasets, software and educational
      resources; and an increase in participatory approaches to science. </p><p>There
      are, however, two downsides to this growth. <strong>First, OS has progressed
      faster in rich countries and organisations. This is no surprise: the transition
      towards OS requires significant financial and human resources</strong>; therefore
      wealthy countries and organisations are in an advantageous position to adopt
      OS. </p><p>However, this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the
      types of OS to develop. For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown
      via the adoption of gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs for organisations),
      although diamond and green OA provide more affordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in resources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries has advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as Eastern
      Europe and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond OA (as shown
      in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models of OA has led
      to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of publications.</p><figure

      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>The
      second gap found by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that <strong>monitoring efforts
      have mainly focused on scientific outputs (primarily in scientific publications,
      and secondly&nbsp;on datasets, software and hardware), but much less on OS processes,
      outcomes or values</strong>. This means that there are too few monitoring efforts
      on axes of OS such as the use of collective infrastructures, participatory activities
      or dialogues with other knowledge systems; and little empirical evidence on
      the alignment of OS progress with values and principles. </p><p>The dangers
      of this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on processes and values)
      is the so-called <a href=\"https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018streetlight
      effect\u2019</a>: that policy attention focuses on those activities that can
      be monitored, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038\" target=\"_blank\">leaving
      behind the disciplines</a>, practices, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/11/28/journal-based-research-assessments-marginalise-regions-like-latin-america-and-the-issues-most-relevant-to-them/\"
      target=\"_blank\">topics and territories</a> which conduct OS in ways that are
      not visible to traditional scientific indicators. Such bias is particularly
      problematic because OS as dialogue and participation is key to help <a href=\"https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/\"
      target=\"_blank\">aligning research with societal problems and challenges</a>.</p><h3><strong>Opening
      up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices</strong></h3><p>In
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress, but that
      this progress is uneven in two senses: it is often concentrated in the rich
      organisations and countries, and it appears to be focused (according to current
      monitoring tools) more on the internal scientific outputs than on knowledge
      creation and exchange with societal stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>These findings
      deserve some reflection in relation to current OS policies. </p><p>In terms
      of monitoring, new <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/\"
      target=\"_blank\">frameworks are needed</a> that are more comprehensive, more
      pluralistic and which include value considerations. In particular, <a href=\"https://osf.io/4vgq5\"
      target=\"_blank\">we have proposed that approaches to assess OS</a> should aim
      to address all aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out the battery of
      OS activities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements); second,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible OS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or green? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third <a href=\"https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">contextualising the description of OS</a> (e.g. high energy
      physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural India require different types
      of OS).</p><p>In terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring on inclusiveness
      and collective benefits is crucial, because science has historically excluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued by scholars such
      as <a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sandra Harding</a>. Also, current research systems tend to
      produce, in relative terms, more benefits for the richer countries (e.g. in
      the field of <a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-00560-6\"
      target=\"_blank\">health research</a>) and for the <a href=\"https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/\"
      target=\"_blank\">richest societal sectors</a> (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/platform-economy-data-generation-and-value-extraction-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2021-02\"

      post introduces the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking, published today
      by CWTS in collaboration with the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, Sesame Open
      Science, and OurResearch. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully
      transparent university ranking.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">When the Shanghai
      Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), was
      launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of CWTS at the time, sounded the alarm
      about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6\" target=\"_blank\">problematic
      way in which the ranking uses bibliometric data</a>, for instance in attributing
      publications to universities. In response to the Shanghai Ranking, CWTS decided
      to launch the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking</a>, aiming to demonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric
      data for comparing universities. While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same
      visibility as the Shanghai, THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation
      for offering a robust, high-quality approach for comparing universities in terms
      of bibliometric parameters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Today, after almost two decades,
      the Leiden Ranking is going to take an ambitious next step in improving bibliometric
      approaches for comparing universities. The <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking</a>, launched today by
      CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of bibliometric indicators:
      the lack of transparency of these indicators due to their dependence on proprietary
      data. Together with the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\" target=\"_blank\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI)</a>, <a href=\"https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sesame Open Science</a>, and <a href=\"https://ourresearch.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OurResearch</a>, CWTS has rebuilt the Leiden Ranking, making
      it fully transparent by working exclusively with open data and open source algorithms.
      Until now, the Leiden Ranking has always been based on data from <a href=\"https://webofscience.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>, a proprietary data source owned by Clarivate.
      The Leiden Ranking Open Edition uses data from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>, a fully open data source created by OurResearch.
      To the best of our knowledge, the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully
      transparent university ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The importance of transparency
      of university rankings is widely recognized. CWTS emphasizes the need to be
      transparent in <a href=\"https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350\"
      target=\"_blank\">its ten rules for ranking universities</a>. Transparency also
      features prominently in the <a href=\"https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">criteria for fair and responsible university rankings</a>
      developed by the International Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS).
      These criteria were used in the <a href=\"https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">rethinking the rankings initiative</a>. Likewise, transparency
      and openness are key elements in the <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university\"
      target=\"_blank\">strategy for culture change regarding university rankings</a>
      that is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general, the
      <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Recommendation
      on Open Science</a> highlights the need for \u201Copen bibliometrics and scientometrics
      systems\u201D. In a similar vein, the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment</a> stresses the
      importance of \u201Cindependence and transparency of the data, infrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\u201D.</p><h3><strong>How did
      we create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition aims to reproduce the traditional Leiden Ranking as closely
      as possible, focusing on the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking 2023</a> that was published in June last year.
      The Open Edition includes the same 1411 universities that are also included
      in the Leiden Ranking 2023. Instead of proprietary data from Web of Science,
      the Open Edition uses open data from OpenAlex. This data is harvested by OpenAlex
      from a <a href=\"https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview\"
      target=\"_blank\">variety of sources</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\"
      target=\"_blank\">PubMed</a>, and the websites of publishers. The Open Edition
      is based on the <a href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex snapshot</a> released on November 21, 2023.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Figure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden Ranking Open
      Edition. We now discuss the different steps in this process.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      Open Edition.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Core publications</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Web of Science and OpenAlex differ in their coverage of the scientific
      literature. Most publications covered by Web of Science are also covered by
      OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications that Web of Science does not
      cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses on so-called core publications,
      which are identified based on a <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">number of criteria</a>. The Open Edition also has a focus
      on core publications, identified based on <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">similar criteria</a>. However, because of coverage differences
      between Web of Science and OpenAlex, the set of core publications considered
      in the Open Edition differs from the set of core publications considered in
      the traditional Leiden Ranking. This is discussed in more detail in <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Publication
      classification</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed
      algorithmic classification of publications into research areas. This classification
      is used to assign publications to main fields and to calculate normalized citation
      impact indicators. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of
      publications based on OpenAlex data. <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">This blog post</a> provides more details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>CWTS

      while the Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal CWTS organization identifiers.
      For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization registry by matching CWTS
      organization identifiers to ROR identifiers. This was done for the 1411 universities
      included in the Open Edition and for the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\">affiliated organizations linked to these universities</a>.
      Additional links between universities and affiliated organizations were obtained
      from the ROR organization registry. Links between universities and their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on the website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).<br></p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\"

      links</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">OpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for the affiliations
      of authors of publications. We linked publications to universities by connecting
      ROR identifiers obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers of universities
      and their affiliated organizations in the CWTS organization registry. In <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a> the CWTS team presents a comparison between
      the approach for linking publications to universities used in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking and the approach used in the Open Edition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Indicators</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The Open Edition includes the same bibliometric indicators as the
      traditional Leiden Ranking, except for <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators\"
      target=\"_blank\">indicators of gender diversity</a>. These indicators are somewhat
      more challenging to produce using OpenAlex data because OpenAlex does not make
      a distinction between first and last names of authors. This distinction is important
      for algorithmic gender inference. At the moment gender diversity indicators
      are therefore not included in the Open Edition. We may add them in the future.</p><h3><strong>How
      to access the data and software</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The data used to
      create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available in Zenodo</a> under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CC0 public domain dedication</a>. The data can also be <a
      href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">accessed through Google BigQuery</a> (to run queries you need
      to have a BigQuery account and your own project). Universities may for instance
      use the data to check whether publications have been correctly attributed to
      them. Performing such checks is not possible in the case of the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, since this ranking is based on proprietary data that cannot
      be shared openly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The source code of the software used to
      create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available in GitHub</a> under an MIT license. A Microsoft
      SQL Server database system was used to perform the data processing and the calculations.
      The source code therefore consists mostly of SQL scripts.<strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>How
      to compare the Open Edition with the traditional Leiden Ranking</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">To what extent does the Open Edition provide results that are similar
      to those provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking? To address this question,
      we have created an <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9\"
      target=\"_blank\">interactive dashboard</a> in which the values of the indicators
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking can be easily compared.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      interactive dashboard can for instance be used to explore the correlation between
      the number of publications of a university in the traditional Leiden Ranking
      and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3), or the correlation between a university\u2019s
      proportion of highly cited publications in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking
      (see Figure 4).<br><br></p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GNdAIHrl957GDdRDrD6fzTA8W-MHOBg_HeLyxOv9KpzoXVTVH0BuYhlkOWefvSzX038JqIOoOe9f_qy4WI-BUWTCXt5D0Ji7XzriBYYKWCjLz0CNxZuj_oeIJwWPtW6NHveE8SlaW2Zg8PgGB4rZOF8\"

      between indicator values in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking to be quite
      strong. However, for some universities there are large differences between the
      two editions of the Leiden Ranking. In many cases this is probably due to differences
      in the publications attributed to a university. This issue is analyzed in more
      detail in <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>.</p><h3><strong>What is next?</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">At the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still of an experimental
      nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful exercise for our organizations
      (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and OurResearch). We also expect to learn
      a lot from the feedback we hope to receive from users of the Open Edition. Based
      on the lessons learned, we will make further improvements to the Open Edition.
      Within one or two years, we expect the Open Edition to be fully mature and to
      offer a full replacement for the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While
      our organisations are making further improvements to the Leiden Ranking Open
      Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates of the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next one or two years, we expect
      the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition to co-exist. In the somewhat
      longer term, CWTS will make a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">full transition to open research information</a>. Within the
      next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS, including those
      in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The transition
      of the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader discussions about openness
      of research information, responsible use of bibliometric indicators, and reform
      of research assessment. Critical reflection on the value of university rankings
      should be part of these important discussions.<br></p><h3><strong>How to get
      in touch</strong><br></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Would you like to know more about the

      CWTS released the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking. This blog post discusses
      the data curation approach taken in this fully transparent edition of the Leiden
      Ranking.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">The need to increase the transparency of university rankings is
      widely recognized, for instance in the <a href=\"https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350\"
      target=\"_blank\">ten rules for ranking universities</a> that we published in
      2017, in the work done by the <a href=\"https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">INORMS Research Evaluation Working Group</a>, and also in
      a <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/publications/Ranking_the_university_ENG.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent report by a Dutch expert group on university rankings</a>
      (co-authored by one of us). It is therefore not surprising that the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">announcement of the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking</a>
      in 2023 got <a href=\"https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-universities-2023-9-leiden-rankings-to-add-open-source-version-in-2024/\"
      target=\"_blank\">considerable attention</a> and triggered lots of highly supportive
      responses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The announcement also led to questions about the
      quality of the data used in the <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition</a>, in particular the affiliation data for linking publications
      to universities. In this post, we address these questions by distinguishing
      between two models for curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed
      model and the decentralized and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking
      relies primarily on the centralized and closed model, the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Edition released today</a> represents a movement toward
      the decentralized and open model.</p><h3><strong>The centralized and closed
      model for data curation</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the centralized and closed
      model, a central actor in the system takes responsibility for data curation.
      The data is closed. It can be accessed only by selected users, who typically
      need to pay to get access.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">traditional Leiden Ranking</a>, based on closed data from
      <a href=\"https://webofscience.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>,
      takes a mostly centralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data curation (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of Science, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which standardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same \u2018unified organizations\u2019). Because
      Web of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable to share the curated data. This
      means there is no easy way for universities to check the quality of the data.</p><h3><strong>The
      decentralized and open model for data curation</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      the decentralized and open model, data curation takes place in a decentralized
      way. Different actors in the system take responsibility for different parts
      of the data curation process. All data is fully open, which facilitates collaboration
      between the different actors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking Open Edition</a>, based on open data from <a
      href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>, takes a mostly
      decentralized approach to curating affiliation data. Contributions to the data
      curation process are made by a number of different actors:</p><ul><li>The <a
      href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Research Organization Registry (ROR)</a>
      provides ROR IDs for research organizations.</li><li>Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author affiliations, to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\"
      target=\"_blank\">PubMed</a>.</li><li>Crossref and PubMed make publication metadata,
      including author affiliations, openly available.</li><li>OpenAlex ingests author
      affiliations from Crossref and PubMed. It performs web scraping to obtain missing
      author affiliations. It then uses a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true\"
      target=\"_blank\">machine learning algorithm</a> to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.</li><li>CWTS maps ROR IDs to \u2018unified organizations\u2019.
      For instance, the ROR IDs of Leiden University (<a href=\"https://ror.org/027bh9e22\"
      target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/027bh9e22</a>) and Leiden University Medical
      Center (<a href=\"https://ror.org/05xvt9f17\" target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/05xvt9f17</a>)
      are both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden University.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      above actors all share data openly. This enables research organizations to check
      the quality of the data and to contribute to the data curation process by reporting
      data quality problems to the relevant actors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).</p><h3><strong>How
      much difference does it make?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past months,
      many people have asked us to what extent results obtained from the data curation
      approach taken in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition are different from results
      obtained from the data curation approach of the traditional Leiden Ranking.
      To answer this question, we match publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science
      based on DOIs and we then use this matching to compare the results obtained
      using the two data curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the
      period 2018-2021.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We first compare the overall set of publications
      included in the traditional Leiden Ranking to the overall set of publications
      included in the Open Edition. The traditional Leiden Ranking includes all publications
      in Web of Science that are indexed in the Science Citation Index, the Social
      Sciences Citation Index, or the Arts & Humanities Citation Index, that are classified
      as research article or review article, and that meet a <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">number of additional criteria</a>. Likewise, the OpenEdition
      includes all publications in OpenAlex that are classified as article or book
      chapter, that have affiliation and reference metadata (for some publications
      this metadata is missing in OpenAlex), and that meet <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">additional criteria similar to those used in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking</a>. Figure 1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.</p><figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"

      1. Overlap of publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition.</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Of the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5
      million (27%) are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The most important
      reason is that publications are not covered by the Web of Science citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is based (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million publications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Conversely,
      of the 7.4 million publications included in the traditional Leiden Ranking,
      0.7 million (9%) are not included in the Open Edition. There are several reasons
      for this. Inconsistencies in publication years (e.g., a publication was published
      in 2017 according to OpenAlex, while it was published in 2018 according to Web
      of Science) are an important reason, explaining why 0.2 million publications
      (3%) are not included in the Open Edition while they are included in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking. However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data
      in OpenAlex. 0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open Edition
      because of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that missing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We now provide a more detailed
      analysis for the 6.8 million publications that are included in both the traditional
      Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition. For each of the 1411 universities in the
      Leiden Ranking 2023, we calculated the percentage of the publications of the
      university in the traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university
      in the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university, sorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      that are not assigned to the university in the Open Edition. Each dot represents
      one university. </figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 2 shows
      there are three universities for which more than 30% of the publications in
      the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the Open
      Edition. In two cases this appears to be due to errors in the traditional Leiden
      Ranking, while in one case this seems to be due to errors in the Open Edition.
      There are 88 universities for which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition. For the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of the publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      manually examined a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a university
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking but not in the Open Edition. For this small
      sample, we found that in 6 cases (24%) the assignment in the traditional Leiden
      Ranking was incorrect (because of an error made by either Web of Science or
      CWTS). In the other 19 cases (76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made
      in the Open Edition (in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation
      in OpenAlex or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 3 offers the opposite perspective
      of Figure 2. For each of the 1411 universities, we calculated the percentage
      of the publications of the university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that
      are not assigned to the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These
      percentages are shown in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.</p><figure

      dir=\"ltr\">As Figure 3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than
      30% of the publications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this appears
      to be due to errors in the Open Edition, while in the other cases this seems
      to be due to errors in the traditional Leiden Ranking. There are 91 universities
      for which between 10% and 30% of the publications in the Open Edition are not
      assigned to the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other
      1306 universities this is the case for less than 10% of the publications in
      the Open Edition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a manual analysis of a random sample

      traditional Leiden Ranking, we found that in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in
      the Open Edition was incorrect (in most cases because of an error in the mapping
      performed by OpenAlex from an affiliation string to a ROR ID). In the other
      6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In summary, for
      publications included in both the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition,
      our findings show that for most universities the data curation yields similar
      results in the two editions of the ranking. When there are differences, errors
      are about three times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking.</p><h3><strong>Room for improvement</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      bibliometric community has extensive experience with the centralized and closed
      model for data curation. Over the years, databases such as Web of Science, Scopus,
      and Dimensions have made considerable investments in this model. Research organizations
      have also made large investments in it, both by paying to get access to the
      above-mentioned databases and by helping these databases improve their data
      (e.g., by reporting data quality problems, such as publications that are assigned
      to an incorrect organization). Likewise, by performing extensive curation of
      affiliation data for the traditional Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science
      data, CWTS has also invested substantially in a mostly centralized approach
      to data curation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The bibliometric community has less experience
      with the decentralized and open model for data curation. Nevertheless, the results
      presented above show that the quality of affiliation data obtained through a
      more decentralized approach is already quite good. Moreover, there are lots
      of opportunities to further improve the data quality. Different actors can contribute
      to this in different ways:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">OpenAlex can contribute by
      making further improvements to the completeness of its affiliation data and
      to the machine learning algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings to ROR
      IDs.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Research organizations can contribute by reporting
      data quality problems to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality
      of its data. Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify problems in
      the data. This is different for closed databases, where only those who pay to
      get access to a database can identify problems.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Publishers
      can contribute by attaching ROR IDs to author affiliations in publications and
      by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/\" target=\"_blank\">depositing
      not only affiliation strings but also ROR IDs to Crossref</a>. Several publishers,
      for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife, have already started to do this.
      This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR IDs from Crossref instead of inferring these
      IDs algorithmically.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">CWTS and other providers of bibliometric
      analytics can contribute by monitoring the quality of the affiliation data obtained
      from OpenAlex and by providing feedback to OpenAlex. If necessary, providers
      of bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation of affiliation data
      as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed by OpenAlex.</li><li
      dir=\"ltr\">All actors in the system can contribute by working together with
      ROR to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing authoritative curations on the
      relationships between institutions and their constituent parts.</li></ul><h3><strong>The
      power of the decentralized and open model</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We seem
      to have reached the limits of what can be achieved using the centralized and
      closed model for curating affiliation data. While for certain use cases the
      model may yield an acceptable data quality, the model is also highly resource-demanding,
      non-transparent, and inflexible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although the decentralized
      and open model is still in an early stage of development, it already yields
      a surprisingly good data quality. Moreover, by distributing the responsibility
      for different parts of the data curation process to different actors in the
      system, the model is more efficient and scalable than the centralized and closed
      model. On top of this, the decentralized and open model facilitates transparency
      and accountability, and offers the flexibility needed to address different use
      cases that require different choices to be made in the data curation process.
      Finally, the decentralized and open model ensures that investments in data curation
      benefit the global academic community instead of increasing the value of proprietary
      data sources.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">opening up the Leiden Ranking</a>, we are moving toward a
      powerful new model for curating affiliation data. We invite universities to
      critically examine the affiliation data used in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition.
      Feedback from universities will help to further develop the decentralized and
      open model for data curation and to realize the highest possible data quality.<br></p><p

      this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open approach for classifying
      research publications, contributing to a broader development toward open approaches
      to bibliometrics.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">Classifying research publications into research topics or research
      areas is crucial for many bibliometric analyses. While there are lots of approaches
      for classifying publications, most of these approaches lack transparency. Although
      there are exceptions (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>), these approaches are typically based on data from
      proprietary sources or they rely on non-transparent algorithms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      introduce an open approach to the algorithmic classification of research publications.
      This approach builds on a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1\" target=\"_blank\">methodology
      we developed more than a decade ago</a>. While this methodology was originally
      applied to closed data from proprietary sources, we now apply it to open data
      from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>. We make
      available a fully open classification of publications. The research areas in
      this classification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and the classification
      is presented visually using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online software</a>. We also release open source
      software that enables anyone to reproduce and extend our work.<br></p><h3>Building
      the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We built <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
      target=\"_blank\">our classification</a> based on OpenAlex data, using the <a
      href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\" target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a>
      released on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has been
      used to create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus data. These
      classifications are available in <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/\"
      target=\"_blank\">InCites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence\"
      target=\"_blank\">SciVal</a>, respectively. Compared to Web of Science and Scopus,
      OpenAlex has the benefit that its data is fully open and that it offers a broader
      coverage of the scholarly literature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To build our classification,
      we used the so-called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035\" target=\"_blank\">extended
      direct citation approach</a> in combination with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden algorithm</a>. The source code of the software we used
      is available <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our classification covers the 71 million journal
      articles, proceedings papers, preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that
      were published between 2000 and 2023 and that are connected to each other by
      citation links. Based on 1715 million citation links, we built a three-level
      hierarchical classification. Each publication was assigned to a research area
      at each of the three levels of the classification. Research areas consist of
      publications that are relatively strongly connected by citation links and that
      can therefore be expected to be topically related. At each level of the classification,
      a publication was assigned to only one research area, which means research areas
      do not overlap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Using the parameter values reported in Table
      1, we obtained a classification that consists of 4521 research areas at the
      lowest (most granular) level, 917 research areas at the middle level, and 20
      research areas at the highest (least granular) level. We also algorithmically
      linked each research area in our classification to one or more of the following
      five broad main fields: biomedical and health sciences, life and earth sciences,
      mathematics and computer science, physical sciences and engineering, and social
      sciences and humanities.</p><table style=\"width:400px; margin:auto;\"><tbody><tr><td

      style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:10px;\"><span class=\"caption\">Table
      1. Parameter values used to build the classification.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nGiven
      the huge size of the citation network based on which we built the classification,
      the process of building the classification was computationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal memory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labeling the research areas in an algorithmically
      built publication classification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach
      introduced in our original methodology yields a list of five characteristic
      terms for each research area. While these terms usually give a reasonably good
      impression of the topics covered by a research area, our experience is that
      users often want to have a single term that summarizes what a research area
      is about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Large language models (LLMs) offer important new
      opportunities to label research areas. We therefore used the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo LLM</a>, developed by OpenAI, to label
      the 4521 research areas at the lowest level in our classification. The source
      code of our software can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For each research area, we provided
      the LLM with the titles of the 250 most cited publications in the area, along
      with the prompt shown in Box 1. Using this prompt, we asked the LLM to return
      a label for each research area, both a short one (max. three words) and a longer
      one (max. eight words). We also requested the LLM to provide a few sentences
      that summarize what the research area is about.</p><div style=\"padding:10px;
      background-color:#F5F5F5;\"><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">You will be provided
      with the titles of a representative sample of papers from a larger cluster of
      related scientific papers.</p><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">Your task is to identify
      the topic of the entire cluster based on the titles of the representative papers.</p><p
      style=\"font-size:14px;\">Output the following items (in English) that describe
      the topic of the cluster: 'short label' (at most 3 words and format in Title
      Case), 'long label' (at most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10 'keywords'
      (ordered by relevance and format in Title Case), 'summary' (few sentences),
      and 'wikipedia page' (URL).<br>\r\nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \"The\".<br>\r\nStart each summary with \"This cluster of papers\".<br>\r\nFormat
      the output in JSON.\r\n</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:10px;\"><span
      class=\"caption\">Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM.\r\n</span></p><p>Table
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521 research areas.
      The results show that this research area is about bibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of the quality of the LLM results, our
      impression is that the results are a substantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original methodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the LLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest level in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory
      results.\r\n</p><table style=\"width:100%;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:100px;\">Short

      of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research evaluation, and the assessment

      networks, and interdisciplinary research</td></tr><tr><td>Wikipedia</td><td><a

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such as GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require further consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We paid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also considered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not seem to yield better results.\r\n</p><h3>Visualizing
      the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A powerful way to use our publication
      classification is to create interactive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents
      an example of such a landscape. It was created using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\">VOSviewer
      Online software</a>. We used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas
      at the lowest level in our classification. Each bubble represents a research
      area. The larger the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research
      area. The distance between bubbles approximately indicates the relatedness of
      research areas in terms of citation links. In general, the smaller the distance
      between two bubbles, the stronger the citation links between the two research
      areas. The color of a bubble shows the primary main field to which a research
      area belongs. For instance, research areas in the physical sciences and engineering
      (blue) are located on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in
      the social sciences and humanities (red) are located on the right side. Finally,
      for some bubbles, the landscape also shows the label obtained using our LLM-based
      labeling approach.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"

      Figure 1 can be explored in more detail in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5\"
      target=\"_blank\">this interactive webtool</a>. The webtool enables zooming
      in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also possible to see the list of
      publications included in each research area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape to show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden University. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one in Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the proportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated with Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which Leiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research area, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be
      explored in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive
      webtool</a>. The webtool for instance reveals that Leiden University has 570
      publications in the period 2000-2023 in the research area labeled \u2018Bibliometric
      Analysis\u2019. This is one of the research areas in the social sciences and
      humanities in which Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.</p><figure><img

      dir=\"ltr\">We have introduced an open approach for classifying research publications
      into research areas: Our approach relies on open data from OpenAlex, our software
      is open source, and our publication classification is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available</a>. The work presented in this blog post
      is part of an <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">ambitious agenda</a> we have at CWTS to move to fully open
      approaches to bibliometrics, and to openness of research information and research
      analytics more generally.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The publication classification discussed
      in this blog post is a crucial building block for the Open Edition of the <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking</a>
      that CWTS is going to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the OpenAlex team as a foundation for a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s\"
      target=\"_blank\">new topic classification for OpenAlex</a>. We hope our work
      will help to advance the transition to open approaches to bibliometrics!<br></p>\n\n

      Information &amp; Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes openness
      of research information. In this blog post, we present our agenda for the coming
      five years.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>How
      to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic X? How to evaluate
      the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish new strategic
      priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples of the many important
      decisions that researchers, research evaluators, and science policy makers need
      to make on a daily basis. Decisions like these are increasingly made in data-driven
      ways, guided by research analytics ranging from simple scientometric indicators
      and university rankings to complex dashboards that bring together data from
      a variety of sources.</p><h3>The Information & Openness focal area</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Last
      year the Information & Openness focal area was established at CWTS. In this
      focal area we are concerned with the complex interplay between decision making
      processes in science, the information used in these processes, and the nature
      of this information in terms of properties such as openness, transparency, inclusiveness,
      and ownership. This complex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from
      two movements with global aspirations: open science and responsible research
      assessment. Our work in the focal area builds on decades of experience we have
      at CWTS in using scientometric data to support research assessment and strategic
      decision making in science. Having been at the forefront of developments in
      scientometrics, we not only have a lot of knowledge about scientometric data
      sources, indicators, and algorithms, but we also have a deep understanding of
      the role scientometrics plays in all kinds of decision-making processes.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Building on our experience and recognizing that decisions in science
      are increasingly being made in data-driven ways, the Information & Openness
      focal area aims to study and promote responsible approaches to the use of data
      in decision making processes in science. We are interested in the properties
      of the data sources that are being used and how these properties contribute
      to, or impede, responsible ways of decision making. The field of scientometrics
      has a long tradition of working with proprietary data sources, especially Web
      of Science and Scopus. However, the closed nature of these data sources is increasingly
      seen as an obstacle to transparent and responsible decision making, for instance
      in the context of research assessment. In the Information & Openness focal area
      we are therefore particularly interested in studying and promoting openness
      of scientometric data, and of research information more generally.</p><h3><strong>Three
      pillars</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the organization of the&nbsp;<a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\" target=\"_blank\">broader
      knowledge agenda of CWTS</a>, our work in the Information & Openness focal area
      is organized in three pillars: understanding, intervening, and practicing. In
      the box below we outline our plans for each of these pillars.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p

      style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the understanding pillar we perform research projects
      with the broad goal of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding
      of the open research information landscape. Based on our scientometric expertise,
      some projects in this pillar may focus on systematically monitoring and tracking
      the availability of open research information. Drawing on our expertise in sociology,
      anthropology, and science and technology studies, other projects may be aimed
      at describing and explaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread,
      or non-spread, of open information practices.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Intervening</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the intervening pillar we take concrete
      actions to advance openness of research information, aiming to make openness
      of research information the norm and to enable more transparent and responsible
      approaches to decision making in science. An example is the transformation of
      the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS Leiden Ranking</a> to a
      tool that is entirely based on open data, resulting in a fully transparent and
      reproducible ranking. The first release of the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking
      will take place later this month, on January 30. Another example is the launch
      of the course<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics
      Using Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the<a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\">
      Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course
      took place in November last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this year. Other actions to advance openness of research information are currently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the coming months.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Practicing</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"
      style=\"font-size:14px;\">Following the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019,
      the practicing pillar focuses on implementing openness of research information
      in our own way of working at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work
      at CWTS (including<a href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\"> CWTS BV</a>) to be fully based
      on open research information. In particular, our aim is that future scientometric
      analyses performed by our center will use only data from open sources, such
      as Crossref, DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex, OpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others.
      This is part of a broader ambition to open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance
      in the way we communicate about our research and about other activities of our
      center. This will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for
      <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open science</a>
      and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research
      data management</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Our way of working</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of more
      than 20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities in the
      understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or practicing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest developments around
      open research information, to share updates on ongoing projects and other activities,
      and to make plans for new initiatives.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal areas of CWTS:<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
      target=\"_blank\"> Engagement & Inclusion</a> and Evaluation & Culture. Through
      the<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\"> UNESCO Lab on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science</a>
      we for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information & Openness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\"> GraspOS project</a> and the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra\"

      Research Assessment (OI4RRA)</a> demonstrates the value of cross fertilization
      between the Information & Openness and Evaluation & Culture focal areas.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We are also setting up collaborations with external partners working
      on open research information. Many organizations are doing crucial work in this
      area. This ranges from research groups that study openness of research information
      to organizations that provide infrastructures for open research information
      and organizations that put the use of open research information into practice
      (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database\"

      a new research project, we  explore the interaction between misinformation and
      science on social media during COVID-19. This is part of the new research line
      on the role of science in societal debates of our Focal Area Engagement &amp;
      Inclusion.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      past years have shown that science can play an important role in societal debates.
      Science was clearly pivotal in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition,
      many of the interventions and policies, such as masking, school closures or
      even curfews, were presented as evidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific
      advances in our understanding of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific
      findings were part of broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal proponents
      and opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised settings. Although very
      visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, science also plays a large role in other
      societal debates, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180\"
      target=\"_blank\">the nitrogen debate in the Netherlands</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies\"
      target=\"_blank\">climate change</a>.</p><p>As a part of our <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
      target=\"_blank\">Focal Area of Engagement & Inclusion</a> at CWTS, we explore
      the role of science in societal debates. We know that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\"
      target=\"_blank\">science does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates
      or clear course of action for polic</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\">y</a>.
      Some of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal debates,
      are different \u201Csides\u201D informed by different literatures, perhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a common evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead to a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open availability of scientific literature shape the role
      of science in societal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific results differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?
      How do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates? </p><p>In addition
      to science, misinformation also plays a large role in societal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to speak of an <a
      href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic\" target=\"_blank\">infodemic</a>.
      Some of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by fact-checkers,
      such as <a href=\"https://maldita.es/\" target=\"_blank\">maldita.es</a>\r\nin
      Spain, or the local \u201C<a href=\"https://nieuwscheckers.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Nieuwscheckers</a>\u201D
      here at Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness by the
      public, such as \u201C<a href=\"https://askforevidence.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask
      for Evidence</a>\u201D or \u201C<a href=\"https://www.bemediasmart.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop,
      Think, Check</a>\u201D, to help prevent the spread of misinformation. But how
      does science interact with misinformation?</p><h3>Science and misinformation</h3><p>We
      are excited to start a new project on <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed\"
      target=\"_blank\">Understanding Misinformation and Science in Societal Debates
      (UnMiSSeD)</a>. In this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation
      and science during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and qualitative
      approaches. Our quantitative analyses will be limited to Twitter (now X), based
      on more than a billion tweets posted during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined
      with information on millions of publications and tweets about them. We will
      go beyond Twitter in our qualitative analyses to explore how discussions permeate
      the porous boundaries of social media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno
      Kessler (FBK), lead by <a href=\"https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8\" target=\"_blank\">Riccardo
      Gallotti</a> and University of Geneva, lead by <a href=\"http://www.tommasoventurini.it/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Tommaso Venturini</a>. We are happy that this project is supported
      by the <a href=\"https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/\"
      target=\"_blank\">European Media and Information Fund</a>.</p><h3>New perspective</h3><p>At
      CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427\"
      target=\"_blank\">connections between science and society</a>, also in the context
      of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset\"
      target=\"_blank\">COVID-19</a>. We also studied how COVID-19 appeared in <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation\"
      target=\"_blank\">a media outlet</a>. Much of our knowledge on science in social
      media is based on data from <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Altmetric</a>\r\nand
      provides a good lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to being
      mentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from science
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken up. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science is mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes <a href=\"http://modesofexistence.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">where scientific mentions are couched in and interact with
      other ways of knowing the world</a>. In the UnMiSSeD project, our starting point
      are societal debates themselves.  We explore when and how science becomes part
      of such debates, also in relation to misinformation and claims unrelated to
      science. In this way, we hope to better understand the role of science and misinformation
      in societal debates.</p><p>This project brings together a novel combination
      of scientific fields at CWTS. Traditionally, our centre is more focused on science
      (and technology) studies. The UnMiSSeD project brings in not only computational
      social sciences but also media and communication studies and has clear connections
      to science communication. We hope to build out these connections in the near
      future. Watch this blog for future updates on our project.\r\nWe are open to
      explore new opportunities, and if you want to connect to us on this topic, please

      September 2023, the city of Leiden in the Netherlands was the venue for not
      just one, but two scientometrics-related events: the CWTS Scientometrics Summer
      School and the STI 2023 conference. Our author attended both and reflects on
      his experience.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Greetings
      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find myself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey: the CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS<sup>3</sup>) and the 27th International Conference on Science,
      Technology, and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023). As a bibliometrics enthusiast
      for the past two decades, this experience has been nothing short of a revelation\u2014a
      journey that prompted me to question the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.</p><p>Two decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by
      conventional survey field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the
      untapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information Science
      (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the controversial realm of the
      h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the scientific output of Peruvian
      researchers. The journey took a pivotal turn in 2015 when I attended the \u201CMeasuring
      Science and Research Performance\u201D&nbsp;course at CWTS in Leiden, a week
      that unraveled the limitations and detrimental consequences associated with
      relying on the h-index for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.</p><p>Why
      the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal impact
      factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently misused bibliometric
      indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated bibliometric studies, I couldn't
      ignore the grim reality in many South American countries\u2014bibliometric reports
      often perpetuate the status quo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and inform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive citations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks
      rather than addressing pressing regional and local needs.</p><p>Even workshops
      advocating for open science, while championing transparency and accessibility,
      often fell short. Discussions on alternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to downloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access publishing dominates the discourse on open science practices, few
      consider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for example, sharing
      bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential for transparent data analysis.<br></p><figure><img

      2 vevrvolg 11\"><figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023 conference.</figcaption></figure><p>Eight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of returning to
      participate in the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">CS3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\" target=\"_blank\">STI
      2023</a>. These events were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered
      a wealth of perspectives that ignited new possibilities for my own research
      journey. The incorporation of insights from the sociology of science and science
      and technology studies (STS) offered a refreshing lens, challenging us to move
      beyond mere numbers and delve into the social and cultural contexts that shape
      scientific knowledge production. Exploring diverse information sources, beyond
      the confines of established databases, promised a more nuanced understanding
      of scientific impact, particularly in regions often marginalized by traditional
      bibliometric approaches.</p><p>But most importantly, the shared experiences
      and diverse perspectives of colleagues from across the globe truly resonated.
      The STI 2023 conference brought together Global North and South voices, bridging
      the gap between established research powerhouses and emerging scientific ecosystems.
      Through open dialogue and critical reflection, we began to dismantle the monolithic
      assumptions that often underpin bibliometric analysis. We acknowledged the distinct
      dynamics of scientific production in different regions and the varying priorities
      and challenges faced by researchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.</p><p>This
      newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true potential of
      bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating critical perspectives,
      and forging connections across borders, we can transform this field from a passive
      observer into an active agent for positive change. We can use bibliometrics
      not to reinforce existing inequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive
      and equitable scientific landscape, one where research serves the needs of all,
      regardless of their geographic location or economic standing.</p><p>In bidding
      farewell to the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">Scientometrics Summer School</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">STI 2023 Conference</a>, I can't help but see it as not just
      an end but a promising new beginning. Armed with enriched perspectives, I embark
      on the next chapter of my bibliometric journey, eager to implement the lessons
      learned in contributing to a more equitable and impactful scientific landscape.<br></p><p><span

      dir=\"ltr\">Open science was one of the key topics at the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators (STI) conference</a>
      that CWTS organised in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science
      was not only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in the
      publication and peer review process of the conference. By way of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference\"
      target=\"_blank\">experiment</a>, all papers submitted to the conference were
      published as a preprint before they were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review
      process was open: Review reports were published alongside the preprinted papers,
      and some reviewers also chose to sign their reports.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What
      did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate the experiment, we invited all
      186 authors of conference submissions to complete a brief anonymous survey (<a

      50%. Below we discuss the outcomes of the survey.<br></p><h3>Preprinting</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about preprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference submissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the highest score (5), indicating
      they \"like it a lot\", and an additional 37% of the respondents selected the
      second-highest score (4). Only a small minority of 6% of the respondents do
      not support preprinting and selected the lowest (1; \"I don't like it at all\")
      or second-lowest (2) score.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"
      data-image=\"37790\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>When asked what they see as
      advantages and disadvantages of preprinting of conference submissions, respondents
      indicated they appreciate the early access and visibility of research through
      preprinting. The ability to receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen
      as an advantage. In addition, preprinting enables researchers to establish priority
      on emerging topics. However, concerns revolve around the quality assurance of
      preprints, with worries that some submissions represent ongoing work that still
      needs further development, in which case preprinting may undermine the credibility
      of the research. There is also a risk that early-career researchers may feel
      pressured by the open nature of preprints.<br></p><h3>Open peer review</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Support for open peer review is almost as strong as support for
      preprinting. 73% of the survey respondents expressed support for open peer review
      (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents were opposed to open peer review
      (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"
      data-image=\"37805\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents recognized several
      advantages of open peer review, including enhanced transparency, constructive
      feedback, and accountability of reviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns
      about variations in review quality and about the potential impact of negative
      reviews, especially on early-career researchers. Some respondents indicated
      a preference for fully anonymous peer review, to make sure author identities
      do not influence reviewers.<br></p><h3>Future editions of the STI conference</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Survey respondents are very positive about the idea of adopting
      preprinting and open peer review at future editions of the STI conference. 76%
      of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score of 4 or 5), while only 7%
      oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"
      data-image=\"37820\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents also offered suggestions
      for improvement. They would value more thorough reviews, increased transparency
      in the decision-making process, and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents
      recommended improving the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several respondents
      felt there is a need to have a more user-friendly platform for publishing and
      reviewing conference submissions.<br></p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses of the
      Orvium platform</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The opinions of survey respondents about
      the <a href=\"https://dapp.orvium.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Orvium platform</a>,
      which was used to publish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When asked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents
      gave a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative response (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the respondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"
      data-image=\"37843\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents mentioned several
      strengths of the Orvium platform, including the platform's ability to issue
      DOIs, support for having multiple versions of a paper, and the generation of
      \u2018previews\u2019 of papers for convenient reading in a web browser. However,
      a number of weaknesses were also mentioned. While some respondents considered
      the platform easy to use, others found that navigation was challenging and the
      interface confusing. Respondents also reported problems with the platform's
      search function.<br></p><h3>Impact of the STI 2023 conference on open science
      perspectives</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed their ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their views on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already supportive of open science. However, a significant share of the
      respondents found that the conference reinforced their positive views of open
      science. These respondents for instance mentioned that they appreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the conference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the conference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science, such as information overload and problems in quality assurance
      processes.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the outcomes of the
      survey, we consider the experiment with preprinting and open peer review at
      the STI 2023 conference to be successful. While some survey respondents are
      critical, a large majority of the respondents are positive about the experiment.
      Moreover, over three-quarters of the respondents recommend that future editions
      of the STI conference adopt preprinting and open peer review. The feedback provided
      by respondents offers excellent guidance for making further improvements to
      publication and peer review processes at the STI conference, hopefully enabling
      the full potential of open science to be realized.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We

      Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST) and the Society
      for Social Studies of Science (4S) join forces to organize the largest conference
      in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) in the world. From 16 to
      19 July, 2024 <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/\" target=\"_blank\">the
      conference</a> is hosted by the Athena Institute in Amsterdam. The call for

      target=\"_blank\">397 open panels</a> proposed by STS scholars from across the
      globe. There is an enormous diversity of topics that are being addressed in
      the open panels and it promises to be an exciting conference!</p><p>CWTS is
      among the larger centres in the field of STS in the Netherlands and we are proud
      to have CWTS colleagues involved in 9 panels. These panels show not only the
      diversity of topics in STS but also the diversity of approaches and topics studied
      at CWTS. Below we present the different panels we are involved in. We hope to

      Transformations: Exploring the technoscience behind our changing relationship
      with the seas</em></a>&nbsp;is organized by Jackie Ashkin in collaboration with
      Sebastian Ureta (Universidad Cat\xF3lica de Chile), Elis Jones (University of
      Exeter), and Jose A. Ca\xF1ada (University of Helsinki). This panel begins from
      the observation that the world\u2019s oceans are in peril. Human actions both
      threaten and promise to save the ocean, but how do technoscientific enterprises
      contribute to transforming human-ocean relations? We invite contributions which
      explore the more-than-human, technoscientific and ethicopolitical dimensions
      of knowing and relating to the ocean.</p><p>Panel number 071, simply entitled
      <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14110\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Seabirds</em></a>
      is organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS, University of Edinburgh and CWTS) with
      Bronte Evans Rayward (SPRI, University of Cambridge) and Oscar Hartman Davies
      (University of Oxford). The Open Panel aims to gather case studies and discussions
      on seabirds to engage with contemporary urgent matters such as environmental
      change and the Anthropocene. We seek to engage with STS topics such as technological
      developments, multispecies and more-than-human studies, and space and its materialities.
      We welcome contributions focused on seabirds or where seabirds play an intriguing
      role in addressing socio-technical matters. What can seabirds teach us? </p><p>Panel
      number 074 explores <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>The limits of Open Research: critical views and new perspectives</em></a>
      and is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open panel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the enactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As the OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying assumption that these values will support the
      evolution of an equitable digital commons and, in consequence, equitable science.
      Nonetheless, simply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design can be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage
      with the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment, raising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful connectivity and digital democratisation.

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Scientific cultures in conflict and transition: Studying
      reform in action</em></a><em>,</em> addresses the recent proliferation of science
      reform movements, including open science, meta-science, responsible research
      and innovation, responsible metrics, and research ssessment reform. These \u2018upstream\u2019
      reform movements seek to address what campaigners consider declining standards
      of quality or propriety around academic knowledge production, communication
      and evaluation within their own professional world. This open panel is co-convened
      by our CWTS colleague Alex Rushforth, together with Bart Penders (Maastricht
      University/Aachen University), and Nicole Nelson (University of Wisconsin Madison).
      They invite case study contributions on one or more scientific reform movement(s)
      which advocate a specific view on the right way to conduct scientific practice(s).</p><p>Panel

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Making and Doing Oceanic Futures: Mobilising the ocean
      and its materialities between hope and loss</em></a> is organized by Francesco
      Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga. The Panel explores the ocean as
      an object of study and concern&nbsp;in various knowledge and artistic practices.
      It queries how oceanic futures are entangled with hope and loss and how these
      futures intersect with socio-political, scientific, economic, industrial, and
      ecological processes. This panel welcomes traditional presentations and artistic
      contributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken words), and invites interventions
      about the ocean as an object of study and an object of concern.<br></p><p>Panel
      number 299 aims to bring together studies of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>new notions of research quality</em></a><em>. </em>Various
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been adding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing organisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and Thed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel
      invites contributions bringing an STS lens to the study of new quality notions,
      the reform movements that support them and the evaluative situations where they
      count. We seek to generate reflections of theoretical and practical significance
      for (e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality in research assessments.
      The panel will combine academic presentations with an interactive workshop.</p><p>Panel

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing ties between
      academic research and polluting industries</em></a> is organized by Jorrit Smit
      and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration with former colleague Guus Dix (UTwente),
      as well as Shivant Jhagroe and Dominika Czerniawska from other faculties of
      Leiden University. In this panel, we want to explore experimental ways for STS
      to engage with the \u201Ccut the ties\u201D debate around campuses worldwide.
      We aim to host a methodologically diverse gathering in which we can collectively
      \u2018excavate\u2019 data and address pivotal political-epistemic effects of
      ties between extractivist polluting industries and academic research in times
      of climate crisis.</p><p>Panel 340 develops the notion of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>More-than human research and Innovation</em></a>. It is
      organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of Edinburgh) and
      Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The panel seeks to bring
      multispecies studies into onversation with STS focusing especially on the productive
      unruliness of mutlispecies collaboration. We seek to think about in/exclusion
      of other-than human stakeholders and the conceptualization and realization of
      agency in ecological restoration, sustainable agriculture, and other future
      ecologies, as well as environmental science and governance, for example the
      instantiation of the \u201Cdo no significant harm\u201D principle in European
      research and innovation. </p><p>Panel 397 deals with <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Responsible innovation in chemistry</em></a>. It is organized
      by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte Asveld and Britte Bouchaut
      (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht University). Chemical pollution
      is a main driver for global biodiversity loss and the emissions of chemical
      industry contribute substantially to climate change. Regulation often falls
      short of adequately addressing all negative impacts of novel chemicals. This
      session calls for papers addressing the opportunities for and barriers to responsible
      innovation in academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge produced and
      what standards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional frameworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical sector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating with industry? </p><p>The

      in these topics to reach out to us!</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">To develop our
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS knowledge agenda</a> we formed <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">three focal areas</a> at the start of this year to organise
      our activities. Here, we introduce the vision and roadmap of the Focal Area
      Engagement & Inclusion.</p><h3>Our vision</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In today's rapidly
      changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse and inclusive science ecosystem
      that engages with society is of paramount importance. As we navigate complex
      global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence,
      it becomes evident that diverse perspectives, inclusive participation and public
      engagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication are key to unlocking
      science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion <em>envisions studying and promoting diversity and inclusivity in
      the science ecosystem and the engagement and communication between science and
      society.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge
      agenda \u2013 <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening </em>and <em>practising
      </em>\u2013 we developed an ambitious agenda for the study and promotion of
      diversity, inclusion, engagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work will not only contribute to research and teaching around these questions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions, and generate insights
      into how we can implement our findings at our own centre.</p><h3>Representation
      & Inclusiveness</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We believe diversity and inclusivity in the
      global science ecosystem is important. By breaking down barriers to participation
      in science for individuals from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences,
      we enrich the pool of knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which, in
      turn, helps to address scientific and societal challenges more effectively.
      Who gets to participate in science is not always self-evident and requires more
      fundamental understanding and well-considered interventions to improve the inclusion
      and representation of all social groups in science, and the science system as
      a whole.</p><h3>Epistemic Diversity</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Epistemic diversity in
      the science system is of major importance. We need to recognise how different
      topics, research questions, knowledge systems, and actors, including <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040\"
      target=\"_blank\">other-than-human</a> ones, help to produce a fairer and more
      nuanced understanding of complex global issues. By monitoring and promoting
      epistemic diversity, we expect to foster a more inclusive and innovative environment
      where different ways of knowing are valued and incorporated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">For instance, we want to study and address the lack of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development\"
      target=\"_blank\">coverage</a> in mainstream scientometric databases; a problem
      that stands in the way of making important societal topics visible in science
      policy. Consequently, we expect to develop <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>multiversatories</em></a>, policies, and recommendations
      to support funders and science policy with reinforcing epistemic diversity.</p><h3>Engagement
      & Communication</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A research system that is disconnected from
      society is essentially ineffective. Science communication, public engagement
      with science, and participatory approaches for collaborative knowledge production
      are integral building blocks for a stronger and more relevant research and innovation
      ecosystem. Effective science communication and public engagement help to bridge
      the gap between academia and society; help to make scientific approaches and
      knowledge more accessible to the wider public and societal stakeholders (e.g.
      policy makers, industry, etc.); limit the impact of misinformation and the misuse
      of scientific information; and may help to increase public trust in science.
      We will study how society engages with science, in order to improve science
      communication and strengthen the role science can play in society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a
      href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">Citizen science</a> and other participatory approaches can
      create a stronger sense of societal ownership and accountability, turning scientific
      research into a collective societal endeavour. Societal actors outside academia
      contribute to the scientific ecosystem in various ways, for instance with local
      and traditional knowledge or insights from lived experience, or by contributing
      to evidence-informed policy-making. The engagement of societal actors can also
      direct the attention of research to issues of societal importance, increasing
      both their societal relevance and their practical impacts. Engaging other actors,
      such as industry, policy-makers or non-governmental organisations, can help
      with more informed policy, decision-making and innovation. We want to study
      citizen-science practices and how they are changing scientific outcomes, with
      the aim of helping to shape citizen-science further.</p><h3>Accomplishing our
      ambitions</h3><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><br><strong></strong></h4><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Coordination
      of dreams, people, and projects</strong></h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The real treasure
      trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion is all the individual members
      with their own areas of expertise, projects, <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">dreams</a>, and activities. We are a team of more than 30
      colleagues from a variety of backgrounds and career stages.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As
      a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD projects, and personal <em>dreams</em>
      into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised as <em>ambitions</em>!),
      as well as into the existing contractual (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">BV</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects\"
      target=\"_blank\">institute projects</a>, and the work of the <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab\"
      target=\"_blank\">Citizen Science Lab</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO lab</a> (Figure 1). This mapping formed an excellent
      means for thinking about our future activities.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/board_fullsize.jpg\"

      dir=\"ltr\">The roadmap</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">We have created a working group for
      each of the three sub-areas to bundle expertise and resources. The working groups
      will bring together a diverse range of colleagues, from within and outside of
      CWTS, each contributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex challenges
      of the sub-areas. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Projects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day
      work at CWTS. Our Focal Area will help coordinate existing projects,  and monitor
      funding opportunities to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning
      projects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving our
      vision and ambitions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central importance for the Focal Area. We think of <a
      href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">dedicated seminars</a>, special sessions at conferences (e.g.
      a special session on \u201C<a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Researching (in-) equity, diversity and inclusion in science

      the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/program/\" target=\"_blank\">STI 2023
      conference</a>), or co-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders.
      In line with our ideal of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\"
      target=\"_blank\">practising what we preach</a>, we ourselves will communicate
      our work and activities to broader audiences through blog posts and social media,
      and look forward to open and engaging conversations with others on these topics.

      on Open Science**\n\nIn 2021, UNESCO approved its [Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949){target=\"_blank\"}\n(OS).
      By signing this recommendation, 193 countries made a commitment to\nsupport
      the development of OS with a vision of [science as a global\npublic\ngood](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/){target=\"_blank\"}.\u00a0\n\nAccording
      to this vision, science is only genuinely \"open\" when it\nembraces some core
      values and principles, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThese include transparency,
      reproducibility and integrity, as generally\nclaimed in OS frameworks, but also
      equity, fairness, diversity and\ninclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute
      to collective benefits,\nwhich are less often invoked in OS policies.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Fig1_2024-01-31-174243_bmfx.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"40420\"

      years after the signature of the OS Recommendation, the [UNESCO OS\nOutlook](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\naccording
      to this value-led perspective. (*Note that the UNESCO OS\nOutlook will be introduced
      by Dr. Tiffany Straza in a CWTS webinar [on\n2^nd^ February, 2024, 15:00-16.15\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\"_blank\"}).*\n\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards \"open\" (i.e.\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\npublications is quickly increasing;
      the Outlook shows evidence of more\nsharing of datasets, software and educational
      resources; and an increase\nin participatory approaches to science.\n\nThere
      are, however, two downsides to this growth. **First, OS has\nprogressed faster
      in rich countries and organisations. This is no\nsurprise: the transition towards
      OS requires significant financial and\nhuman resources**; therefore wealthy
      countries and organisations are in\nan advantageous position to adopt OS.\n\nHowever,
      this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the types\nof OS to develop.
      For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown\nvia the adoption of
      gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\nfor organisations), although
      diamond and green OA provide more\naffordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in\nresources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as
      Eastern\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond OA
      (as\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models of\nOA
      has led to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of\npublications.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Fig2_2024-01-31-175826_zzva.png\"\ndata-image=\"40421\"

      Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nThe second gap found
      by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that **monitoring\nefforts have mainly focused on
      scientific outputs (primarily in\nscientific publications, and secondly\u00a0on
      datasets, software and\nhardware), but much less on OS processes, outcomes or
      values**. This\nmeans that there are too few monitoring efforts on axes of OS
      such as\nthe use of collective infrastructures, participatory activities or\ndialogues
      with other knowledge systems; and little empirical evidence on\nthe alignment
      of OS progress with values and principles.\n\nThe dangers of this uneven monitoring
      (a focus on outputs but not on\nprocesses and values) is the so-called [''streetlight\neffect''](https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm){target=\"_blank\"}:
      that\npolicy attention focuses on those activities that can be monitored,\n[leaving
      behind the\ndisciplines](https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038){target=\"_blank\"},\npractices,
      [topics and\nterritories](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/11/28/journal-based-research-assessments-marginalise-regions-like-latin-america-and-the-issues-most-relevant-to-them/){target=\"_blank\"}\nwhich
      conduct OS in ways that are not visible to traditional scientific\nindicators.
      Such bias is particularly problematic because OS as dialogue\nand participation
      is key to help [aligning research with societal\nproblems and\nchallenges](https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      **Opening up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices**\n\nIn
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress,\nbut that
      this progress is uneven in two senses: it is often concentrated\nin the rich
      organisations and countries, and it appears to be focused\n(according to current
      monitoring tools) more on the internal scientific\noutputs than on knowledge
      creation and exchange with societal\nstakeholders.\u00a0\n\nThese findings deserve
      some reflection in relation to current OS\npolicies.\n\nIn terms of monitoring,
      new [frameworks are\nneeded](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      are more comprehensive, more pluralistic and which include value\nconsiderations.
      In particular, [we have proposed that approaches to\nassess OS](https://osf.io/4vgq5){target=\"_blank\"}
      should aim to address\nall aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out the
      battery of OS\nactivities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements);\nsecond,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible\nOS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or\ngreen? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third [contextualising the description\nof\nOS](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n(e.g.
      high energy physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural\nIndia require
      different types of OS).\n\nIn terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring
      on inclusiveness and\ncollective benefits is crucial, because science has historically\nexcluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued\nby scholars such
      as [Sandra\nHarding](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAlso,
      current research systems tend to produce, in relative terms, more\nbenefits
      for the richer countries (e.g. in the field of [health\nresearch](https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-00560-6){target=\"_blank\"})\nand
      for the [richest societal\nsectors](https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/){target=\"_blank\"}\n(e.g.
      [Big\nTech](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/platform-economy-data-generation-and-value-extraction-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2021-02){target=\"_blank\"}).  \n\n*See

      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\\naccording
      to this value-led perspective. (*Note that the UNESCO OS\\nOutlook will be introduced
      by Dr. Tiffany Straza in a CWTS webinar [on\\n2^nd^ February, 2024, 15:00-16.15\\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).*\\n\\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards \\\"open\\\" (i.e.\\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\\npublications is quickly
      increasing; the Outlook shows evidence of more\\nsharing of datasets, software
      and educational resources; and an increase\\nin participatory approaches to
      science.\\n\\nThere are, however, two downsides to this growth. **First, OS
      has\\nprogressed faster in rich countries and organisations. This is no\\nsurprise:
      the transition towards OS requires significant financial and\\nhuman resources**;
      therefore wealthy countries and organisations are in\\nan advantageous position
      to adopt OS.\\n\\nHowever, this inequality also reflects choices made regarding
      the types\\nof OS to develop. For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly
      grown\\nvia the adoption of gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\\nfor
      organisations), although diamond and green OA provide more\\naffordable and
      more equitable alternatives. Given differences in\\nresources and distinct publishing
      traditions, OA in Western countries\\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models,
      whereas regions such as Eastern\\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial
      share of diamond OA (as\\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold
      and hybrid models of\\nOA has led to territorial inequality in the visibility
      and prestige of\\npublications.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Fig2_2024-01-31-175826_zzva.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"40421\\\"

      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"

      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge
      Initiative (COKI),\nSesame Open Science, OurResearch, SIRIS Academic, and Sorbonne\nUniversity

      In this\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\nreleased\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\n\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\n\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"

      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge
      Initiative (COKI),\nSesame Open Science, OurResearch, SIRIS Academic, and Sorbonne\nUniversity

      to questions about the quality of the data\nused in the [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      in particular\nthe affiliation data for linking publications to universities.
      In this\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\nreleased\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\n\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\n\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"

      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge

      "How to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic X? How to\nevaluate
      the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish\nnew strategic
      priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\nof the many important
      decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\nand science policy makers
      need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\nthese are increasingly made in
      data-driven ways, guided by research\nanalytics ranging from simple scientometric
      indicators and university\nrankings to complex dashboards that bring together
      data from a variety\nof sources.\n\n### The Information & Openness focal area
      {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\n\nLast year the Information & Openness
      focal area was established at CWTS.\nIn this focal area we are concerned with
      the complex interplay between\ndecision making processes in science, the information
      used in these\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in terms of properties\nsuch
      as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership. This\ncomplex interplay
      is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\nwith global aspirations:
      open science and responsible research\nassessment. Our work in the focal area
      builds on decades of experience\nwe have at CWTS in using scientometric data
      to support research\nassessment and strategic decision making in science. Having
      been at the\nforefront of developments in scientometrics, we not only have a
      lot of\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators, and algorithms,\nbut
      we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics plays\nin all kinds
      of decision-making processes.\n\nBuilding on our experience and recognizing
      that decisions in science are\nincreasingly being made in data-driven ways,
      the Information & Openness\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\nof data in decision making processes in science. We are
      interested in\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and how
      these\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research information
      more\ngenerally.\n\n### **Three pillars**\n\nIn line with the organization of
      the\u00a0[broader knowledge agenda of\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width:
      100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\nbroad goal of
      developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\ninformation the norm and to
      enable more transparent and responsible\napproaches to decision making in science.
      An example is the\ntransformation of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\nresulting in a fully
      transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\nrelease of the Open Edition
      of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\nthis month, on January 30. Another
      example is the launch of the course<a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\n<a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\ncoming months.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\nfuture scientometric analyses performed
      by our center will use only data\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref, DataCite,
      ORCID, OpenAlex,\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part of a broader
      ambition\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the way we\ncommunicate
      about our research and about other activities of our center.\nThis will also
      include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open\nscience</a>
      and <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### **Our way of working**\n\nThe
      team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of more than\n20 CWTS
      colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities in\nthe understanding
      pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\npracticing pillars. We
      meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\ndevelopments around open research
      information, to share updates on\nongoing projects and other activities, and
      to make plans for new\ninitiatives.\n\nOur work also aims to contribute to strengthening
      the other two focal\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\nInclusion in
      Global\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\nOpenness and
      Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\nthe [GraspOS project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and the\n[CoARA working group on Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research\nAssessment\n(OI4RRA)](https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra){target=\"_blank\"}\ndemonstrates
      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\n\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\nopen

      area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\\n\\nLast year the Information &
      Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\\nIn this focal area we are concerned
      with the complex interplay between\\ndecision making processes in science, the
      information used in these\\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in
      terms of properties\\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership.
      This\\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\\nwith
      global aspirations: open science and responsible research\\nassessment. Our
      work in the focal area builds on decades of experience\\nwe have at CWTS in
      using scientometric data to support research\\nassessment and strategic decision
      making in science. Having been at the\\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\\n\\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\\nof data in decision making processes in science. We
      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and
      how these\\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research
      information more\\ngenerally.\\n\\n### **Three pillars**\\n\\nIn line with the
      organization of the\_[broader knowledge agenda of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\\noutline our

      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\\nbroad goal
      of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing

      of open information practices.</p>\\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\\ninformation the norm and
      to enable more transparent and responsible\\napproaches to decision making in
      science. An example is the\\ntransformation of the <a href=\\\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\\\">CWTS\\nLeiden

      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\\nown way of working

      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the

      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand

      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS
      project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and the\\n[CoARA working

      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\\n\\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\\nresearch information

      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand

      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS

      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find\nmyself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey:\nthe CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\nConference on Science, Technology,
      and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the
      past two decades, this experience\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a
      journey that prompted me to\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.\n\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by conventional\nsurvey
      field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the\nuntapped potential
      of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\nScience (LIS). My maiden
      bibliometric study delved into the\ncontroversial realm of the h-index, assessing
      its utility in gauging the\nscientific output of Peruvian researchers. The journey
      took a pivotal\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \"Measuring Science and Research\nPerformance\"\u00a0course
      at CWTS in Leiden, a week that unraveled the\nlimitations and detrimental consequences
      associated with relying on the\nh-index for critical decisions like research
      grants or promotions.\n\nWhy the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely
      contested journal\nimpact factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\nmisused
      bibliometric indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\nbibliometric studies,
      I couldn\\''t ignore the grim reality in many South\nAmerican countries---bibliometric
      reports often perpetuate the status\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\n\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\ntransparency and accessibility, often fell
      short. Discussions on\nalternative indicators typically revolve around metrics
      tied to\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While open-access\npublishing
      dominates the discourse on open science practices, few\nconsider the potential
      of data sharing and code transparency: for\nexample, sharing bibliographic datasets
      or the R/Stata codes essential\nfor transparent data analysis.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\"\nalt=\"Day

      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\nreturning
      to participate in the\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}. These\nevents were
      crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\n\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\necosystems. Through open dialogue and critical
      reflection, we began to\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that often underpin
      bibliometric\nanalysis. We acknowledged the distinct dynamics of scientific
      production\nin different regions and the varying priorities and challenges faced
      by\nresearchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.\n\nThis newfound
      awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true\npotential of bibliometrics.
      By embracing diversity, incorporating\ncritical perspectives, and forging connections
      across borders, we can\ntransform this field from a passive observer into an
      active agent for\npositive change. We can use bibliometrics not to reinforce
      existing\ninequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive and equitable\nscientific
      landscape, one where research serves the needs of all,\nregardless of their
      geographic location or economic standing.\n\nIn bidding farewell to the [Scientometrics

      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find\\nmyself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey:\\nthe CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\\nConference on Science, Technology,
      and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the
      past two decades, this experience\\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a
      journey that prompted me to\\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.\\n\\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by
      conventional\\nsurvey field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized
      the\\nuntapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\\nScience
      (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the\\ncontroversial realm of
      the h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the\\nscientific output of Peruvian
      researchers. The journey took a pivotal\\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \\\"Measuring
      Science and Research\\nPerformance\\\"\_course at CWTS in Leiden, a week that
      unraveled the\\nlimitations and detrimental consequences associated with relying
      on the\\nh-index for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.\\n\\nWhy
      the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal\\nimpact
      factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\\nmisused bibliometric
      indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\\nbibliometric studies, I couldn\\\\'t
      ignore the grim reality in many South\\nAmerican countries---bibliometric reports
      often perpetuate the status\\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\\n\\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\\ntransparency and accessibility, often
      fell short. Discussions on\\nalternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to\\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access\\npublishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
      few\\nconsider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for\\nexample,
      sharing bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential\\nfor transparent
      data analysis.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Day
      2 vevrvolg 11\\\" />\\n<figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023\\nconference.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nEight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\\nreturning
      to participate in the\\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. These\\nevents
      were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\\n\\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\\necosystems. Through open dialogue and
      critical reflection, we began to\\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that
      often underpin bibliometric\\nanalysis. We acknowledged the distinct dynamics
      of scientific production\\nin different regions and the varying priorities and
      challenges faced by\\nresearchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.\\n\\nThis
      newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true\\npotential
      of bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating\\ncritical perspectives,
      and forging connections across borders, we can\\ntransform this field from a
      passive observer into an active agent for\\npositive change. We can use bibliometrics
      not to reinforce existing\\ninequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive
      and equitable\\nscientific landscape, one where research serves the needs of
      all,\\nregardless of their geographic location or economic standing.\\n\\nIn
      bidding farewell to the [Scientometrics Summer\\nSchool](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [STI 2023\\nConference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I can\\\\'t help\\nbut see it as not just an end but a promising new beginning.
      Armed with\\nenriched perspectives, I embark on the next chapter of my bibliometric\\njourney,
      eager to implement the lessons learned in contributing to a\\nmore equitable
      and impactful scientific landscape.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader and in-text\_image:

      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\nassumption that these values will support the
      evolution of an equitable\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable science.
      Nonetheless,\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\nwith
      the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment,\nraising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful\nconnectivity and digital democratisation.\n\nPanel
      number 145, [*Scientific cultures in conflict and transition:\nStudying reform
      in\naction*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14191){target=\"_blank\"}*,*\naddresses
      the recent proliferation of science reform movements,\nincluding open science,
      meta-science, responsible research and\ninnovation, responsible metrics, and
      research ssessment reform. These\n''upstream'' reform movements seek to address
      what campaigners consider\ndeclining standards of quality or propriety around
      academic knowledge\nproduction, communication and evaluation within their own
      professional\nworld. This open panel is co-convened by our CWTS colleague Alex\nRushforth,
      together with Bart Penders (Maastricht University/Aachen\nUniversity), and Nicole
      Nelson (University of Wisconsin Madison). They\ninvite case study contributions
      on one or more scientific reform\nmovement(s) which advocate a specific view
      on the right way to conduct\nscientific practice(s).\n\nPanel number 154, entitled

      between hope and\nloss*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14200){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Francesco Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga.\nThe Panel
      explores the ocean as an object of study and concern\u00a0in\nvarious knowledge
      and artistic practices. It queries how oceanic futures\nare entangled with hope
      and loss and how these futures intersect with\nsocio-political, scientific,
      economic, industrial, and ecological\nprocesses. This panel welcomes traditional
      presentations and artistic\ncontributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken
      words), and invites\ninterventions about the ocean as an object of study and
      an object of\nconcern.  \n\nPanel number 299 aims to bring together studies
      of [*new notions of\nresearch\nquality*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378){target=\"_blank\"}*.*\nVarious
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been\nadding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing\norganisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and\nThed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel
      invites contributions bringing an\nSTS lens to the study of new quality notions,
      the reform movements that\nsupport them and the evaluative situations where
      they count. We seek to\ngenerate reflections of theoretical and practical significance
      for\n(e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality in research\nassessments.
      The panel will combine academic presentations with an\ninteractive workshop.\n\nPanel
      number 328, entitled [*Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing\nties between
      academic research and polluting\nindustries*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14411){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Jorrit Smit and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration\nwith former
      colleague Guus Dix (UTwente), as well as Shivant Jhagroe and\nDominika Czerniawska
      from other faculties of Leiden University. In this\npanel, we want to explore
      experimental ways for STS to engage with the\n\"cut the ties\" debate around
      campuses worldwide. We aim to host a\nmethodologically diverse gathering in
      which we can collectively\n''excavate'' data and address pivotal political-epistemic
      effects of ties\nbetween extractivist polluting industries and academic research
      in times\nof climate crisis.\n\nPanel 340 develops the notion of [*More-than

      and Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The\npanel seeks to
      bring multispecies studies into onversation with STS\nfocusing especially on
      the productive unruliness of mutlispecies\ncollaboration. We seek to think about
      in/exclusion of other-than human\nstakeholders and the conceptualization and
      realization of agency in\necological restoration, sustainable agriculture, and
      other future\necologies, as well as environmental science and governance, for
      example\nthe instantiation of the \"do no significant harm\" principle in European\nresearch
      and innovation.\n\nPanel 397 deals with [*Responsible innovation in\nchemistry*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is organized by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte\nAsveld
      and Britte Bouchaut (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht\nUniversity).
      Chemical pollution is a main driver for global biodiversity\nloss and the emissions
      of chemical industry contribute substantially to\nclimate change. Regulation
      often falls short of adequately addressing\nall negative impacts of novel chemicals.
      This session calls for papers\naddressing the opportunities for and barriers
      to responsible innovation\nin academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge
      produced and what\nstandards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional\nframeworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical\nsector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating\nwith industry?\n\nThe
      call for abstract is now\n[open](https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      will close on 12 February 2024. In case you are interested in\nsubmitting an
      abstract but are unsure whether your paper fits the panel,\ndo reach out to

      "The past years have shown that science can play an important role in\nsocietal
      debates. Science was clearly pivotal in the development of\nCOVID-19 vaccines.
      In addition, many of the interventions and policies,\nsuch as masking, school
      closures or even curfews, were presented as\nevidence-based solutions, motivated
      by scientific advances in our\nunderstanding of the virus. In return, these
      policies and scientific\nfindings were part of broader societal debates, with
      sometimes vocal\nproponents and opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised\nsettings.
      Although very visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\nalso plays a large
      role in other societal debates, such as [the nitrogen\ndebate in the\nNetherlands](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180){target=\"_blank\"},\nor
      [climate\nchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs
      a part of our [Focal Area of Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      CWTS, we explore the role of science in societal debates. We know\nthat [science
      does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates or\nclear course of action
      for\npolic](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308){target=\"_blank\"}[y](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308).\nSome
      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\ndebates,
      are different \"sides\" informed by different literatures,\nperhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a\ncommon evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead\nto a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open\navailability of scientific literature shape the
      role of science in\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific\nresults differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?\nHow
      do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\n\nIn addition to
      science, misinformation also plays a large role in\nsocietal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak of an\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\nfact-checkers, such
      as\n[maldita.es](https://maldita.es/){target=\"_blank\"} in Spain, or the\nlocal
      \"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\"\nhere at
      Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness\nby the public,
      such as \"[Ask for\nEvidence](https://askforevidence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\"
      or \"[Stop,\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\"_blank\"}\",
      to help\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\nmisinformation?\n\n### Science and misinformation\n\nWe are excited to
      start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\nlead by [Riccardo\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We are\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\nInformation\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      New perspective\n\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\nbetween science and\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\"_blank\"},
      also in\nthe context of\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\"_blank\"}.\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and provides a\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to
      being\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\nscientific mentions are couched in
      and interact with other ways of\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      In\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\nand misinformation in societal debates.\n\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\nCWTS. Traditionally,
      our centre is more focused on science (and\ntechnology) studies. The UnMiSSeD
      project brings in not only\ncomputational social sciences but also media and
      communication studies\nand has clear connections to science communication. We
      hope to build out\nthese connections in the near future. Watch this blog for
      future updates\non our project. We are open to explore new opportunities, and

      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\nand misinformation in societal debates.\n\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\nCWTS. Traditionally,
      our centre is more focused on science (and\ntechnology) studies. The UnMiSSeD
      project brings in not only\ncomputational social sciences but also media and
      communication studies\nand has clear connections to science communication. We
      hope to build out\nthese connections in the near future. Watch this blog for
      future updates\non our project. We are open to explore new opportunities, and

      and\nInnovation Indicators (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS\norganised in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science
      was\nnot only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe
      publication and peer review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate

      science was one of the key topics at the [Science, Technology and\nInnovation
      Indicators (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"} that
      CWTS\norganised in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science was\nnot
      only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe publication
      and peer review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate

      "To develop our [CWTS knowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      formed [three focal\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\nthe vision
      and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\n\n### Our vision\n\nIn
      today\\''s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\nand inclusive
      science ecosystem that engages with society is of\nparamount importance. As
      we navigate complex global challenges such as\nclimate change, pandemics, and
      artificial intelligence, it becomes\nevident that diverse perspectives, inclusive
      participation and public\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication
      are key to\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal\nArea
      Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and promoting diversity\nand inclusivity
      in the science ecosystem and the engagement and\ncommunication between science
      and society.*\n\nIn line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda
      --\n*understanding*, *intervening* and *practising* -- we developed an\nambitious
      agenda for the study and promotion of diversity, inclusion,\nengagement, communication
      and science-society interactions. Our work\nwill not only contribute to research
      and teaching around these\nquestions, but will also support policy developments
      and interventions,\nand generate insights into how we can implement our findings
      at our own\ncentre.\n\n### Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\n\nWe
      believe diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\nimportant.
      By breaking down barriers to participation in science for\nindividuals from
      a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\nenrich the pool of
      knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which,\nin turn, helps to address
      scientific and societal challenges more\neffectively. Who gets to participate
      in science is not always\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding
      and\nwell-considered interventions to improve the inclusion and\nrepresentation
      of all social groups in science, and the science system\nas a whole.\n\n###
      Epistemic Diversity\n\nEpistemic diversity in the science system is of major
      importance. We\nneed to recognise how different topics, research questions,
      knowledge\nsystems, and actors, including\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\"_blank\"}\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\nglobal issues.
      By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\nexpect to foster a more
      inclusive and innovative environment where\ndifferent ways of knowing are valued
      and incorporated.\n\nFor instance, we want to study and address the lack of\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\n\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\n\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\nintegral building blocks for a stronger
      and more relevant research and\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science communication
      and public\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia and society;
      help to\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible to the wider\npublic
      and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry, etc.);\nlimit the impact
      of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\ninformation; and may help to
      increase public trust in science. We will\nstudy how society engages with science,
      in order to improve science\ncommunication and strengthen the role science can
      play in society.\n\n[Citizen\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\n\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\n\n####   {#section dir=\"ltr\"}\n\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion
      is all\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise, projects,\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\n\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\"_blank\"})
      and [institute\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      the work of the [Citizen Science\nLab](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [UNESCO\nlab](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n(Figure
      1). This mapping formed an excellent means for thinking about\nour future activities.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/board_fullsize.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"1ppykiiy08s7\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Mapping of our current projects and activities to\nthe
      three sub-areas (initially labelled as <em>ambitions</em>) - Miro\nboard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n####
      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nWe have created a working group for
      each of the three sub-areas to\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and outside
      of CWTS, each\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex\nchallenges
      of the sub-areas.\n\nProjects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day work at
      CWTS. Our Focal\nArea will help coordinate existing projects, and monitor funding\nopportunities
      to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning\nprojects with the
      goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving\nour vision and ambitions.\n\nIn
      addition, engagement and communication activities will be of central\nimportance
      for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \"[Researching\n(in-) equity,
      diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\nmixed- and multi-method\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\"_blank\"}s\"\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\"_blank\"}),
      or\nco-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders. In line\nwith
      our ideal of [practising what we\npreach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      ourselves will communicate our work and activities to broader\naudiences through
      blog posts and social media, and look forward to open\nand engaging conversations

      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion is all\\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise,
      projects,\\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      and [institute\\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \\\"[Researching\\n(in-)
      equity, diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\\nmixed- and
      multi-method\\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}s\\\"\\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      or\\nco-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders. In line\\nwith
      our ideal of [practising what we\\npreach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwe
      ourselves will communicate our work and activities to broader\\naudiences through

      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####

      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial

      de Chile), Elis Jones (University of Exeter), and\nJose A. Ca\u00f1ada (University
      of Helsinki). This panel begins from the\nobservation that the world''s oceans
      are in peril. Human actions both\nthreaten and promise to save the ocean, but
      how do technoscientific\nenterprises contribute to transforming human-ocean
      relations? We invite\ncontributions which explore the more-than-human, technoscientific
      and\nethicopolitical dimensions of knowing and relating to the ocean.\n\nPanel
      number 071, simply entitled\n[*Seabirds*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14110){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS, University of Edinburgh and CWTS)\nwith Bronte
      Evans Rayward (SPRI, University of Cambridge) and Oscar\nHartman Davies (University
      of Oxford). The Open Panel aims to gather\ncase studies and discussions on seabirds
      to engage with contemporary\nurgent matters such as environmental change and
      the Anthropocene. We\nseek to engage with STS topics such as technological developments,\nmultispecies
      and more-than-human studies, and space and its\nmaterialities. We welcome contributions
      focused on seabirds or where\nseabirds play an intriguing role in addressing
      socio-technical matters.\nWhat can seabirds teach us?\n\nPanel number 074 explores
      [*The limits of Open Research: critical views\nand new\nperspectives*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\nassumption that these values will support the
      evolution of an equitable\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable science.
      Nonetheless,\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\nwith
      the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment,\nraising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful\nconnectivity and digital democratisation.\n\nPanel
      number 145, [*Scientific cultures in conflict and transition:\nStudying reform
      in\naction*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14191){target=\"_blank\"}*,*\naddresses
      the recent proliferation of science reform movements,\nincluding open science,
      meta-science, responsible research and\ninnovation, responsible metrics, and
      research ssessment reform. These\n''upstream'' reform movements seek to address
      what campaigners consider\ndeclining standards of quality or propriety around
      academic knowledge\nproduction, communication and evaluation within their own
      professional\nworld. This open panel is co-convened by our CWTS colleague Alex\nRushforth,
      together with Bart Penders (Maastricht University/Aachen\nUniversity), and Nicole
      Nelson (University of Wisconsin Madison). They\ninvite case study contributions
      on one or more scientific reform\nmovement(s) which advocate a specific view
      on the right way to conduct\nscientific practice(s).\n\nPanel number 154, entitled
      [*Making and Doing Oceanic Futures:\nMobilising the ocean and its materialities
      between hope and\nloss*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14200){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Francesco Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga.\nThe Panel
      explores the ocean as an object of study and concern\u00a0in\nvarious knowledge
      and artistic practices. It queries how oceanic futures\nare entangled with hope
      and loss and how these futures intersect with\nsocio-political, scientific,
      economic, industrial, and ecological\nprocesses. This panel welcomes traditional
      presentations and artistic\ncontributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken
      words), and invites\ninterventions about the ocean as an object of study and
      an object of\nconcern.  \n\nPanel number 299 aims to bring together studies
      of [*new notions of\nresearch\nquality*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378){target=\"_blank\"}*.*\nVarious
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been\nadding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing\norganisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and\nThed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel
      invites contributions bringing an\nSTS lens to the study of new quality notions,
      the reform movements that\nsupport them and the evaluative situations where
      they count. We seek to\ngenerate reflections of theoretical and practical significance
      for\n(e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality in research\nassessments.
      The panel will combine academic presentations with an\ninteractive workshop.\n\nPanel
      number 328, entitled [*Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing\nties between
      academic research and polluting\nindustries*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14411){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Jorrit Smit and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration\nwith former
      colleague Guus Dix (UTwente), as well as Shivant Jhagroe and\nDominika Czerniawska
      from other faculties of Leiden University. In this\npanel, we want to explore
      experimental ways for STS to engage with the\n\"cut the ties\" debate around
      campuses worldwide. We aim to host a\nmethodologically diverse gathering in
      which we can collectively\n''excavate'' data and address pivotal political-epistemic
      effects of ties\nbetween extractivist polluting industries and academic research
      in times\nof climate crisis.\n\nPanel 340 develops the notion of [*More-than
      human research and\nInnovation*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of\nEdinburgh)
      and Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The\npanel seeks to
      bring multispecies studies into onversation with STS\nfocusing especially on
      the productive unruliness of mutlispecies\ncollaboration. We seek to think about
      in/exclusion of other-than human\nstakeholders and the conceptualization and
      realization of agency in\necological restoration, sustainable agriculture, and
      other future\necologies, as well as environmental science and governance, for
      example\nthe instantiation of the \"do no significant harm\" principle in European\nresearch
      and innovation.\n\nPanel 397 deals with [*Responsible innovation in\nchemistry*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is organized by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte\nAsveld
      and Britte Bouchaut (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht\nUniversity).
      Chemical pollution is a main driver for global biodiversity\nloss and the emissions
      of chemical industry contribute substantially to\nclimate change. Regulation
      often falls short of adequately addressing\nall negative impacts of novel chemicals.
      This session calls for papers\naddressing the opportunities for and barriers
      to responsible innovation\nin academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge
      produced and what\nstandards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional\nframeworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical\nsector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating\nwith industry?\n\nThe
      call for abstract is now\n[open](https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      will close on 12 February 2024. In case you are interested in\nsubmitting an
      abstract but are unsure whether your paper fits the panel,\ndo reach out to

      "To develop our [CWTS knowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      formed [three focal\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\nthe vision
      and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\n\n### Our vision\n\nIn
      today\\''s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\nand inclusive
      science ecosystem that engages with society is of\nparamount importance. As
      we navigate complex global challenges such as\nclimate change, pandemics, and
      artificial intelligence, it becomes\nevident that diverse perspectives, inclusive
      participation and public\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication
      are key to\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal\nArea
      Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and promoting diversity\nand inclusivity
      in the science ecosystem and the engagement and\ncommunication between science
      and society.*\n\nIn line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda
      --\n*understanding*, *intervening* and *practising* -- we developed an\nambitious
      agenda for the study and promotion of diversity, inclusion,\nengagement, communication
      and science-society interactions. Our work\nwill not only contribute to research
      and teaching around these\nquestions, but will also support policy developments
      and interventions,\nand generate insights into how we can implement our findings
      at our own\ncentre.\n\n### Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\n\nWe
      believe diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\nimportant.
      By breaking down barriers to participation in science for\nindividuals from
      a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\nenrich the pool of
      knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which,\nin turn, helps to address
      scientific and societal challenges more\neffectively. Who gets to participate
      in science is not always\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding
      and\nwell-considered interventions to improve the inclusion and\nrepresentation
      of all social groups in science, and the science system\nas a whole.\n\n###
      Epistemic Diversity\n\nEpistemic diversity in the science system is of major
      importance. We\nneed to recognise how different topics, research questions,
      knowledge\nsystems, and actors, including\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\"_blank\"}\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\nglobal issues.
      By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\nexpect to foster a more
      inclusive and innovative environment where\ndifferent ways of knowing are valued
      and incorporated.\n\nFor instance, we want to study and address the lack of\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\n\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\n\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\nintegral building blocks for a stronger
      and more relevant research and\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science communication
      and public\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia and society;
      help to\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible to the wider\npublic
      and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry, etc.);\nlimit the impact
      of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\ninformation; and may help to
      increase public trust in science. We will\nstudy how society engages with science,
      in order to improve science\ncommunication and strengthen the role science can
      play in society.\n\n[Citizen\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\n\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\n\n####   {#section dir=\"ltr\"}\n\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion
      is all\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise, projects,\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\n\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\"_blank\"})
      and [institute\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\"_blank\"},\nand

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nWe have created a working group for
      each of the three sub-areas to\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and outside
      of CWTS, each\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex\nchallenges
      of the sub-areas.\n\nProjects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day work at
      CWTS. Our Focal\nArea will help coordinate existing projects, and monitor funding\nopportunities
      to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning\nprojects with the
      goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving\nour vision and ambitions.\n\nIn
      addition, engagement and communication activities will be of central\nimportance
      for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \"[Researching\n(in-) equity,
      diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\nmixed- and multi-method\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\"_blank\"}s\"\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\"_blank\"}),

      formed [three focal\\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,

      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen

      formed [three focal\\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion is all\\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise,
      projects,\\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      and [institute\\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      the work of the [Citizen Science\\nLab](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [UNESCO\\nlab](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(Figure
      1). This mapping formed an excellent means for thinking about\\nour future activities.

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \\\"[Researching\\n(in-)
      equity, diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\\nmixed- and
      multi-method\\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}s\\\"\\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      or\\nco-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders. In line\\nwith
      our ideal of [practising what we\\npreach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwe
      ourselves will communicate our work and activities to broader\\naudiences through
      blog posts and social media, and look forward to open\\nand engaging conversations
      with others on these topics.\\n\\nIf you are interested in partnering with us
