      December, UNESCO published the first global report on the trends of Open Science
      (OS). In this blog post, the main findings are highlighted: OS is increasing
      but does so unevenly and its monitoring is mainly focused on outputs, missing
      potential progress in participation and dialogue.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3><strong>A value-led perspective
      on Open Science</strong></h3><p>In 2021, UNESCO approved its <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Open Science</a> (OS). By signing this recommendation,
      193 countries made a commitment to support the development of OS with a vision
      of <a href=\"https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/\"
      target=\"_blank\">science as a global public good</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>According
      to this vision, science is only genuinely \u201Copen\u201D when it embraces
      some core values and principles, as illustrated in Figure 1. These include transparency,
      reproducibility and integrity, as generally claimed in OS frameworks, but also
      equity, fairness, diversity and inclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute
      to collective benefits, which are less often invoked in OS policies. </p><p></p><figure

      Science.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Findings of the Outlook: more Open
      Science, but unevenly distributed</strong></h3><p>Two years after the signature
      of the OS Recommendation, the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO OS Outlook</a> is the first (pilot) global monitoring
      exercise on the progress of OS according to this value-led perspective.</p><p><span
      class=\"caption\"><em>(Note that the UNESCO OS Outlook will be introduced by
      Dr. Tiffany Straza in a&nbsp;CWTS webinar <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook\"
      target=\"_blank\">on 2<sup>nd</sup> February, 2024, 15:00-16.15 CET</a>).</em></span><span
      class=\"caption\"><em></em></span></p><p>The good news is that there is a strong
      trend towards\u201Copen\u201D (i.e. accessible) scientific outputs: the share
      of Open Access (OA) publications is quickly increasing; the Outlook shows evidence
      of more sharing of datasets, software and educational resources; and an increase
      in participatory approaches to science.</p><p>There are, however, two downsides
      to this growth. First, OS has progressed faster in rich countries and organisations.
      This is no surprise: the transition towards OS requires significant financial
      and human resources; therefore wealthy countries and organisations are in an
      advantageous position to adopt OS. </p><p>However, this inequality also reflects
      choices made regarding the types of OS to develop. For example, as shown in
      Figure 2, OA has mainly grown via the adoption of gold and hybrid OA models
      (with substantial costs for organisations), although diamond and green OA provide
      more affordable and more equitable alternatives. Given differences in resources
      and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western countries has advanced via
      gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as Eastern Europe and Latin America
      have kept a substantial share of diamond OA (as shown in Figure 3). In short,
      the expansion of gold and hybrid models of OA has led to territorial inequality
      in the visibility and prestige of publications.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>The
      second gap found by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that monitoring efforts have mainly
      focused on scientific outputs (primarily in scientific publications, and secondly&nbsp;on
      datasets, software and hardware), but much less on OS processes, outcomes or
      values. This means that there are too few monitoring efforts on axes of open
      science such as the use of collective infrastructures, participatory activities
      or dialogues with other knowledge systems; and little empirical evidence on
      the alignment of OS progress with values and principles. </p><p>The dangers
      of this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on processes and values)
      is the so-called <a href=\"https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018streetlight
      effect\u2019</a>: that policy attention focuses on those activities that can
      be monitored, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038\" target=\"_blank\">leaving
      behind the disciplines</a>, practices, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/11/28/journal-based-research-assessments-marginalise-regions-like-latin-america-and-the-issues-most-relevant-to-them/\"
      target=\"_blank\">topics and territories</a> which conduct open science in ways
      that are not visible to traditional scientific indicators. Such bias is particularly
      problematic because OS as dialogue and participation is key to help <a href=\"https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/\"
      target=\"_blank\">aligning research with societal problems and challenges</a>.</p><h3><strong>Opening
      up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices</strong></h3><p>In
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress, but that
      this progress is uneven in two senses: it is concentrated in the rich organisations
      and countries, and it appears to be focused (according to current monitoring
      tools) more on the internal scientific outputs than on knowledge creation and
      exchange with societal stakeholders. </p><p>These findings deserve some reflection
      in relation to current OS policies. </p><p>In terms of monitoring, new <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/\"
      target=\"_blank\">frameworks are needed</a> that are more comprehensive, more
      pluralistic and which include value considerations. In particular, <a href=\"https://osf.io/4vgq5\"
      target=\"_blank\">we have proposed that approaches to assess OS</a> should aim
      to address all aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out the battery of
      OS activities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements); second,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible OS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or green? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third <a href=\"https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">contextualising the description of OS</a> (e.g. high energy
      physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural India require different types
      of OS).</p><p>In terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring on inclusiveness
      and collective benefits is crucial, because science has historically excluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued by scholars such
      as <a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sandra Harding</a>. Also, current research systems tend to
      produce, in relative terms, more benefits for the richer countries (e.g. in
      the field of <a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-00560-6\"
      target=\"_blank\">health research</a>) and for the <a href=\"https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/\"
      target=\"_blank\">richest societal sectors</a> (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/platform-economy-data-generation-and-value-extraction-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2021-02\"

      post introduces the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking, published today
      by CWTS in collaboration with the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative, Sesame Open
      Science, and OurResearch. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully
      transparent university ranking.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">When the Shanghai
      Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), was
      launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of CWTS at the time, sounded the alarm
      about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6\" target=\"_blank\">problematic
      way in which the ranking uses bibliometric data</a>, for instance in attributing
      publications to universities. In response to the Shanghai Ranking, CWTS decided
      to launch the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking</a>, aiming to demonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric
      data for comparing universities. While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same
      visibility as the Shanghai, THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation
      for offering a robust, high-quality approach for comparing universities in terms
      of bibliometric parameters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Today, after almost two decades,
      the Leiden Ranking is going to take an ambitious next step in improving bibliometric
      approaches for comparing universities. The <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking</a>, launched today by
      CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of bibliometric indicators:
      the lack of transparency of these indicators due to their dependence on proprietary
      data. Together with the <a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\" target=\"_blank\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI)</a>, <a href=\"https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sesame Open Science</a>, and <a href=\"https://ourresearch.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OurResearch</a>, CWTS has rebuilt the Leiden Ranking, making
      it fully transparent by working exclusively with open data and open source algorithms.
      Until now, the Leiden Ranking has always been based on data from <a href=\"https://webofscience.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>, a proprietary data source owned by Clarivate.
      The Leiden Ranking Open Edition uses data from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>, a fully open data source created by OurResearch.
      To the best of our knowledge, the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is the first fully
      transparent university ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The importance of transparency
      of university rankings is widely recognized. CWTS emphasizes the need to be
      transparent in <a href=\"https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350\"
      target=\"_blank\">its ten rules for ranking universities</a>. Transparency also
      features prominently in the <a href=\"https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">criteria for fair and responsible university rankings</a>
      developed by the International Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS).
      These criteria were used in the <a href=\"https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">rethinking the rankings initiative</a>. Likewise, transparency
      and openness are key elements in the <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university\"
      target=\"_blank\">strategy for culture change regarding university rankings</a>
      that is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general, the
      <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Recommendation
      on Open Science</a> highlights the need for \u201Copen bibliometrics and scientometrics
      systems\u201D. In a similar vein, the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment</a> stresses the
      importance of \u201Cindependence and transparency of the data, infrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\u201D.</p><h3><strong>How did
      we create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition aims to reproduce the traditional Leiden Ranking as closely
      as possible, focusing on the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking 2023</a> that was published in June last year.
      The Open Edition includes the same 1411 universities that are also included
      in the Leiden Ranking 2023. Instead of proprietary data from Web of Science,
      the Open Edition uses open data from OpenAlex. This data is harvested by OpenAlex
      from a <a href=\"https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview\"
      target=\"_blank\">variety of sources</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\"
      target=\"_blank\">PubMed</a>, and the websites of publishers. The Open Edition
      is based on the <a href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex snapshot</a> released on November 21, 2023.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Figure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden Ranking Open
      Edition. We now discuss the different steps in this process.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      Open Edition.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Core publications</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Web of Science and OpenAlex differ in their coverage of the scientific
      literature. Most publications covered by Web of Science are also covered by
      OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications that Web of Science does not
      cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses on so-called core publications,
      which are identified based on a <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">number of criteria</a>. The Open Edition also has a focus
      on core publications, identified based on <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">similar criteria</a>. However, because of coverage differences
      between Web of Science and OpenAlex, the set of core publications considered
      in the Open Edition differs from the set of core publications considered in
      the traditional Leiden Ranking. This is discussed in more detail in <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Publication
      classification</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed
      algorithmic classification of publications into research areas. This classification
      is used to assign publications to main fields and to calculate normalized citation
      impact indicators. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of
      publications based on OpenAlex data. <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">This blog post</a> provides more details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>CWTS
      organization registry</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">OpenAlex uses <a href=\"https://ror.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ROR (Research Organization Registry) identifiers</a> for organizations,
      while the Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal CWTS organization identifiers.
      For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization registry by matching CWTS
      organization identifiers to ROR identifiers. This was done for the 1411 universities
      included in the Open Edition and for the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\">affiliated organizations linked to these universities</a>.
      Additional links between universities and affiliated organizations were obtained
      from the ROR organization registry. Links between universities and their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on the website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).<br></p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\"

      links</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">OpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for the affiliations
      of authors of publications. We linked publications to universities by connecting
      ROR identifiers obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers of universities
      and their affiliated organizations in the CWTS organization registry. In <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a> the CWTS team presents a comparison between
      the approach for linking publications to universities used in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking and the approach used in the Open Edition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Indicators</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The Open Edition includes the same bibliometric indicators as the
      traditional Leiden Ranking, except for <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators\"
      target=\"_blank\">indicators of gender diversity</a>. These indicators are somewhat
      more challenging to produce using OpenAlex data because OpenAlex does not make
      a distinction between first and last names of authors. This distinction is important
      for algorithmic gender inference. At the moment gender diversity indicators
      are therefore not included in the Open Edition. We may add them in the future.</p><h3><strong>How
      to access the data and software</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The data used to
      create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available in Zenodo</a> under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CC0 public domain dedication</a>. The data can also be <a
      href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">accessed through Google BigQuery</a> (to run queries you need
      to have a BigQuery account and your own project). Universities may for instance
      use the data to check whether publications have been correctly attributed to
      them. Performing such checks is not possible in the case of the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, since this ranking is based on proprietary data that cannot
      be shared openly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The source code of the software used to
      create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available in GitHub</a> under an MIT license. A Microsoft
      SQL Server database system was used to perform the data processing and the calculations.
      The source code therefore consists mostly of SQL scripts.<strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>How
      to compare the Open Edition with the traditional Leiden Ranking</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">To what extent does the Open Edition provide results that are similar
      to those provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking? To address this question,
      we have created an <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9\"
      target=\"_blank\">interactive dashboard</a> in which the values of the indicators
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking can be easily compared.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      interactive dashboard can for instance be used to explore the correlation between
      the number of publications of a university in the traditional Leiden Ranking
      and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3), or the correlation between a university\u2019s
      proportion of highly cited publications in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking
      (see Figure 4).<br><br></p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GNdAIHrl957GDdRDrD6fzTA8W-MHOBg_HeLyxOv9KpzoXVTVH0BuYhlkOWefvSzX038JqIOoOe9f_qy4WI-BUWTCXt5D0Ji7XzriBYYKWCjLz0CNxZuj_oeIJwWPtW6NHveE8SlaW2Zg8PgGB4rZOF8\"

      between indicator values in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking to be quite
      strong. However, for some universities there are large differences between the
      two editions of the Leiden Ranking. In many cases this is probably due to differences
      in the publications attributed to a university. This issue is analyzed in more
      detail in <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>.</p><h3><strong>What is next?</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">At the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still of an experimental
      nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful exercise for our organizations
      (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and OurResearch). We also expect to learn
      a lot from the feedback we hope to receive from users of the Open Edition. Based
      on the lessons learned, we will make further improvements to the Open Edition.
      Within one or two years, we expect the Open Edition to be fully mature and to
      offer a full replacement for the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While
      our organisations are making further improvements to the Leiden Ranking Open
      Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates of the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next one or two years, we expect
      the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition to co-exist. In the somewhat
      longer term, CWTS will make a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">full transition to open research information</a>. Within the
      next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS, including those
      in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The transition
      of the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader discussions about openness
      of research information, responsible use of bibliometric indicators, and reform
      of research assessment. Critical reflection on the value of university rankings
      should be part of these important discussions.<br></p><h3><strong>How to get
      in touch</strong><br></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Would you like to know more about the

      CWTS released the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking. This blog post discusses
      the data curation approach taken in this fully transparent edition of the Leiden
      Ranking.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">The need to increase the transparency of university rankings is
      widely recognized, for instance in the <a href=\"https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350\"
      target=\"_blank\">ten rules for ranking universities</a> that we published in
      2017, in the work done by the <a href=\"https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">INORMS Research Evaluation Working Group</a>, and also in
      a <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/publications/Ranking_the_university_ENG.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent report by a Dutch expert group on university rankings</a>
      (co-authored by one of us). It is therefore not surprising that the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">announcement of the Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking</a>
      in 2023 got <a href=\"https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-universities-2023-9-leiden-rankings-to-add-open-source-version-in-2024/\"
      target=\"_blank\">considerable attention</a> and triggered lots of highly supportive
      responses.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The announcement also led to questions about the
      quality of the data used in the <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition</a>, in particular the affiliation data for linking publications
      to universities. In this post, we address these questions by distinguishing
      between two models for curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed
      model and the decentralized and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking
      relies primarily on the centralized and closed model, the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Edition released today</a> represents a movement toward
      the decentralized and open model.</p><h3><strong>The centralized and closed
      model for data curation</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the centralized and closed
      model, a central actor in the system takes responsibility for data curation.
      The data is closed. It can be accessed only by selected users, who typically
      need to pay to get access.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">traditional Leiden Ranking</a>, based on closed data from
      <a href=\"https://webofscience.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>,
      takes a mostly centralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data curation (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of Science, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which standardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same \u2018unified organizations\u2019). Because
      Web of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable to share the curated data. This
      means there is no easy way for universities to check the quality of the data.</p><h3><strong>The
      decentralized and open model for data curation</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      the decentralized and open model, data curation takes place in a decentralized
      way. Different actors in the system take responsibility for different parts
      of the data curation process. All data is fully open, which facilitates collaboration
      between the different actors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking Open Edition</a>, based on open data from <a
      href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>, takes a mostly
      decentralized approach to curating affiliation data. Contributions to the data
      curation process are made by a number of different actors:</p><ul><li>The <a
      href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Research Organization Registry (ROR)</a>
      provides ROR IDs for research organizations.</li><li>Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author affiliations, to <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\"
      target=\"_blank\">PubMed</a>.</li><li>Crossref and PubMed make publication metadata,
      including author affiliations, openly available.</li><li>OpenAlex ingests author
      affiliations from Crossref and PubMed. It performs web scraping to obtain missing
      author affiliations. It then uses a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true\"
      target=\"_blank\">machine learning algorithm</a> to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.</li><li>CWTS maps ROR IDs to \u2018unified organizations\u2019.
      For instance, the ROR IDs of Leiden University (<a href=\"https://ror.org/027bh9e22\"
      target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/027bh9e22</a>) and Leiden University Medical
      Center (<a href=\"https://ror.org/05xvt9f17\" target=\"_blank\">https://ror.org/05xvt9f17</a>)
      are both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden University.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      above actors all share data openly. This enables research organizations to check
      the quality of the data and to contribute to the data curation process by reporting
      data quality problems to the relevant actors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).</p><h3><strong>How
      much difference does it make?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past months,
      many people have asked us to what extent results obtained from the data curation
      approach taken in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition are different from results
      obtained from the data curation approach of the traditional Leiden Ranking.
      To answer this question, we match publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science
      based on DOIs and we then use this matching to compare the results obtained
      using the two data curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the
      period 2018-2021.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We first compare the overall set of publications
      included in the traditional Leiden Ranking to the overall set of publications
      included in the Open Edition. The traditional Leiden Ranking includes all publications
      in Web of Science that are indexed in the Science Citation Index, the Social
      Sciences Citation Index, or the Arts & Humanities Citation Index, that are classified
      as research article or review article, and that meet a <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">number of additional criteria</a>. Likewise, the OpenEdition
      includes all publications in OpenAlex that are classified as article or book
      chapter, that have affiliation and reference metadata (for some publications
      this metadata is missing in OpenAlex), and that meet <a href=\"https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications\"
      target=\"_blank\">additional criteria similar to those used in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking</a>. Figure 1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.</p><figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"

      1. Overlap of publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition.</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Of the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5
      million (27%) are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The most important
      reason is that publications are not covered by the Web of Science citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is based (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million publications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Conversely,
      of the 7.4 million publications included in the traditional Leiden Ranking,
      0.7 million (9%) are not included in the Open Edition. There are several reasons
      for this. Inconsistencies in publication years (e.g., a publication was published
      in 2017 according to OpenAlex, while it was published in 2018 according to Web
      of Science) are an important reason, explaining why 0.2 million publications
      (3%) are not included in the Open Edition while they are included in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking. However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data
      in OpenAlex. 0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open Edition
      because of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that missing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We now provide a more detailed
      analysis for the 6.8 million publications that are included in both the traditional
      Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition. For each of the 1411 universities in the
      Leiden Ranking 2023, we calculated the percentage of the publications of the
      university in the traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university
      in the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university, sorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      that are not assigned to the university in the Open Edition. Each dot represents
      one university. </figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 2 shows
      there are three universities for which more than 30% of the publications in
      the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the Open
      Edition. In two cases this appears to be due to errors in the traditional Leiden
      Ranking, while in one case this seems to be due to errors in the Open Edition.
      There are 88 universities for which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition. For the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of the publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      manually examined a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a university
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking but not in the Open Edition. For this small
      sample, we found that in 6 cases (24%) the assignment in the traditional Leiden
      Ranking was incorrect (because of an error made by either Web of Science or
      CWTS). In the other 19 cases (76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made
      in the Open Edition (in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation
      in OpenAlex or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 3 offers the opposite perspective
      of Figure 2. For each of the 1411 universities, we calculated the percentage
      of the publications of the university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that
      are not assigned to the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These
      percentages are shown in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.</p><figure

      dir=\"ltr\">As Figure 3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than
      30% of the publications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this appears
      to be due to errors in the Open Edition, while in the other cases this seems
      to be due to errors in the traditional Leiden Ranking. There are 91 universities
      for which between 10% and 30% of the publications in the Open Edition are not
      assigned to the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other
      1306 universities this is the case for less than 10% of the publications in
      the Open Edition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a manual analysis of a random sample
      of 25 publications assigned to a university in the Open Edition but not in the
      traditional Leiden Ranking, we found that in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in
      the Open Edition was incorrect (in most cases because of an error in the mapping
      performed by OpenAlex from an affiliation string to a ROR ID). In the other
      6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In summary, for
      publications included in both the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open Edition,
      our findings show that for most universities the data curation yields similar
      results in the two editions of the ranking. When there are differences, errors
      are about three times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking.</p><h3><strong>Room for improvement</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      bibliometric community has extensive experience with the centralized and closed
      model for data curation. Over the years, databases such as Web of Science, Scopus,
      and Dimensions have made considerable investments in this model. Research organizations
      have also made large investments in it, both by paying to get access to the
      above-mentioned databases and by helping these databases improve their data
      (e.g., by reporting data quality problems, such as publications that are assigned
      to an incorrect organization). Likewise, by performing extensive curation of
      affiliation data for the traditional Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science
      data, CWTS has also invested substantially in a mostly centralized approach
      to data curation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The bibliometric community has less experience
      with the decentralized and open model for data curation. Nevertheless, the results
      presented above show that the quality of affiliation data obtained through a
      more decentralized approach is already quite good. Moreover, there are lots
      of opportunities to further improve the data quality. Different actors can contribute
      to this in different ways:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">OpenAlex can contribute by
      making further improvements to the completeness of its affiliation data and
      to the machine learning algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings to ROR
      IDs.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Research organizations can contribute by reporting
      data quality problems to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality
      of its data. Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify problems in
      the data. This is different for closed databases, where only those who pay to
      get access to a database can identify problems.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Publishers
      can contribute by attaching ROR IDs to author affiliations in publications and
      by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/\" target=\"_blank\">depositing
      not only affiliation strings but also ROR IDs to Crossref</a>. Several publishers,
      for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife, have already started to do this.
      This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR IDs from Crossref instead of inferring these
      IDs algorithmically.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">CWTS and other providers of bibliometric
      analytics can contribute by monitoring the quality of the affiliation data obtained
      from OpenAlex and by providing feedback to OpenAlex. If necessary, providers
      of bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation of affiliation data
      as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed by OpenAlex.</li><li
      dir=\"ltr\">All actors in the system can contribute by working together with
      ROR to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing authoritative curations on the
      relationships between institutions and their constituent parts.</li></ul><h3><strong>The
      power of the decentralized and open model</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We seem
      to have reached the limits of what can be achieved using the centralized and
      closed model for curating affiliation data. While for certain use cases the
      model may yield an acceptable data quality, the model is also highly resource-demanding,
      non-transparent, and inflexible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although the decentralized
      and open model is still in an early stage of development, it already yields
      a surprisingly good data quality. Moreover, by distributing the responsibility
      for different parts of the data curation process to different actors in the
      system, the model is more efficient and scalable than the centralized and closed
      model. On top of this, the decentralized and open model facilitates transparency
      and accountability, and offers the flexibility needed to address different use
      cases that require different choices to be made in the data curation process.
      Finally, the decentralized and open model ensures that investments in data curation
      benefit the global academic community instead of increasing the value of proprietary
      data sources.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition\"
      target=\"_blank\">opening up the Leiden Ranking</a>, we are moving toward a
      powerful new model for curating affiliation data. We invite universities to
      critically examine the affiliation data used in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition.
      Feedback from universities will help to further develop the decentralized and
      open model for data curation and to realize the highest possible data quality.<br></p><p

      this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open approach for classifying
      research publications, contributing to a broader development toward open approaches
      to bibliometrics.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">Classifying research publications into research topics or research
      areas is crucial for many bibliometric analyses. While there are lots of approaches
      for classifying publications, most of these approaches lack transparency. Although
      there are exceptions (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>), these approaches are typically based on data from
      proprietary sources or they rely on non-transparent algorithms.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      introduce an open approach to the algorithmic classification of research publications.
      This approach builds on a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1\" target=\"_blank\">methodology
      we developed more than a decade ago</a>. While this methodology was originally
      applied to closed data from proprietary sources, we now apply it to open data
      from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>. We make
      available a fully open classification of publications. The research areas in
      this classification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and the classification
      is presented visually using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online software</a>. We also release open source
      software that enables anyone to reproduce and extend our work.<br></p><h3>Building
      the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We built <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
      target=\"_blank\">our classification</a> based on OpenAlex data, using the <a
      href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\" target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a>
      released on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has been
      used to create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus data. These
      classifications are available in <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/\"
      target=\"_blank\">InCites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence\"
      target=\"_blank\">SciVal</a>, respectively. Compared to Web of Science and Scopus,
      OpenAlex has the benefit that its data is fully open and that it offers a broader
      coverage of the scholarly literature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To build our classification,
      we used the so-called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035\" target=\"_blank\">extended
      direct citation approach</a> in combination with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden algorithm</a>. The source code of the software we used
      is available <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our classification covers the 71 million journal
      articles, proceedings papers, preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that
      were published between 2000 and 2023 and that are connected to each other by
      citation links. Based on 1715 million citation links, we built a three-level
      hierarchical classification. Each publication was assigned to a research area
      at each of the three levels of the classification. Research areas consist of
      publications that are relatively strongly connected by citation links and that
      can therefore be expected to be topically related. At each level of the classification,
      a publication was assigned to only one research area, which means research areas
      do not overlap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Using the parameter values reported in Table
      1, we obtained a classification that consists of 4521 research areas at the
      lowest (most granular) level, 917 research areas at the middle level, and 20
      research areas at the highest (least granular) level. We also algorithmically
      linked each research area in our classification to one or more of the following
      five broad main fields: biomedical and health sciences, life and earth sciences,
      mathematics and computer science, physical sciences and engineering, and social
      sciences and humanities.</p><table style=\"width:400px; margin:auto;\"><tbody><tr><td

      style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:10px;\"><span class=\"caption\">Table
      1. Parameter values used to build the classification.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nGiven
      the huge size of the citation network based on which we built the classification,
      the process of building the classification was computationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal memory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\r\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Labeling the research areas in an algorithmically
      built publication classification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach
      introduced in our original methodology yields a list of five characteristic
      terms for each research area. While these terms usually give a reasonably good
      impression of the topics covered by a research area, our experience is that
      users often want to have a single term that summarizes what a research area
      is about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Large language models (LLMs) offer important new
      opportunities to label research areas. We therefore used the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo LLM</a>, developed by OpenAI, to label
      the 4521 research areas at the lowest level in our classification. The source
      code of our software can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For each research area, we provided
      the LLM with the titles of the 250 most cited publications in the area, along
      with the prompt shown in Box 1. Using this prompt, we asked the LLM to return
      a label for each research area, both a short one (max. three words) and a longer
      one (max. eight words). We also requested the LLM to provide a few sentences
      that summarize what the research area is about.</p><div style=\"padding:10px;
      background-color:#F5F5F5;\"><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">You will be provided
      with the titles of a representative sample of papers from a larger cluster of
      related scientific papers.</p><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">Your task is to identify
      the topic of the entire cluster based on the titles of the representative papers.</p><p
      style=\"font-size:14px;\">Output the following items (in English) that describe
      the topic of the cluster: 'short label' (at most 3 words and format in Title
      Case), 'long label' (at most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10 'keywords'
      (ordered by relevance and format in Title Case), 'summary' (few sentences),
      and 'wikipedia page' (URL).<br>\r\nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \"The\".<br>\r\nStart each summary with \"This cluster of papers\".<br>\r\nFormat
      the output in JSON.\r\n</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center; margin-top:10px;\"><span
      class=\"caption\">Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM.\r\n</span></p><p>Table
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521 research areas.
      The results show that this research area is about bibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of the quality of the LLM results, our
      impression is that the results are a substantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original methodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the LLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest level in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory
      results.\r\n</p><table style=\"width:100%;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:100px;\">Short

      networks, and interdisciplinary research</td></tr><tr><td>Wikipedia</td><td><a

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such as GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require further consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We paid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also considered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not seem to yield better results.\r\n</p><h3>Visualizing
      the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A powerful way to use our publication
      classification is to create interactive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents
      an example of such a landscape. It was created using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\">VOSviewer
      Online software</a>. We used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas
      at the lowest level in our classification. Each bubble represents a research
      area. The larger the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research
      area. The distance between bubbles approximately indicates the relatedness of
      research areas in terms of citation links. In general, the smaller the distance
      between two bubbles, the stronger the citation links between the two research
      areas. The color of a bubble shows the primary main field to which a research
      area belongs. For instance, research areas in the physical sciences and engineering
      (blue) are located on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in
      the social sciences and humanities (red) are located on the right side. Finally,
      for some bubbles, the landscape also shows the label obtained using our LLM-based
      labeling approach.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"

      Figure 1 can be explored in more detail in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5\"
      target=\"_blank\">this interactive webtool</a>. The webtool enables zooming
      in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also possible to see the list of
      publications included in each research area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape to show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden University. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one in Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the proportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated with Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which Leiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research area, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be
      explored in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive
      webtool</a>. The webtool for instance reveals that Leiden University has 570
      publications in the period 2000-2023 in the research area labeled \u2018Bibliometric
      Analysis\u2019. This is one of the research areas in the social sciences and
      humanities in which Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.</p><figure><img

      dir=\"ltr\">We have introduced an open approach for classifying research publications
      into research areas: Our approach relies on open data from OpenAlex, our software
      is open source, and our publication classification is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
      target=\"_blank\">openly available</a>. The work presented in this blog post
      is part of an <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">ambitious agenda</a> we have at CWTS to move to fully open
      approaches to bibliometrics, and to openness of research information and research
      analytics more generally.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The publication classification discussed
      in this blog post is a crucial building block for the Open Edition of the <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking</a>
      that CWTS is going to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the OpenAlex team as a foundation for a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s\"
      target=\"_blank\">new topic classification for OpenAlex</a>. We hope our work
      will help to advance the transition to open approaches to bibliometrics!<br></p>\n\n

      Information &amp; Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes openness
      of research information. In this blog post, we present our agenda for the coming
      five years.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>How
      to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic X? How to evaluate
      the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish new strategic
      priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples of the many important
      decisions that researchers, research evaluators, and science policy makers need
      to make on a daily basis. Decisions like these are increasingly made in data-driven
      ways, guided by research analytics ranging from simple scientometric indicators
      and university rankings to complex dashboards that bring together data from
      a variety of sources.</p><h3>The Information & Openness focal area</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Last
      year the Information & Openness focal area was established at CWTS. In this
      focal area we are concerned with the complex interplay between decision making
      processes in science, the information used in these processes, and the nature
      of this information in terms of properties such as openness, transparency, inclusiveness,
      and ownership. This complex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from
      two movements with global aspirations: open science and responsible research
      assessment. Our work in the focal area builds on decades of experience we have
      at CWTS in using scientometric data to support research assessment and strategic
      decision making in science. Having been at the forefront of developments in
      scientometrics, we not only have a lot of knowledge about scientometric data
      sources, indicators, and algorithms, but we also have a deep understanding of
      the role scientometrics plays in all kinds of decision-making processes.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Building on our experience and recognizing that decisions in science
      are increasingly being made in data-driven ways, the Information & Openness
      focal area aims to study and promote responsible approaches to the use of data
      in decision making processes in science. We are interested in the properties
      of the data sources that are being used and how these properties contribute
      to, or impede, responsible ways of decision making. The field of scientometrics
      has a long tradition of working with proprietary data sources, especially Web
      of Science and Scopus. However, the closed nature of these data sources is increasingly
      seen as an obstacle to transparent and responsible decision making, for instance
      in the context of research assessment. In the Information & Openness focal area
      we are therefore particularly interested in studying and promoting openness
      of scientometric data, and of research information more generally.</p><h3><strong>Three
      pillars</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the organization of the&nbsp;<a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\" target=\"_blank\">broader
      knowledge agenda of CWTS</a>, our work in the Information & Openness focal area
      is organized in three pillars: understanding, intervening, and practicing. In
      the box below we outline our plans for each of these pillars.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p
      dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Understanding</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"
      style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the understanding pillar we perform research projects
      with the broad goal of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding
      of the open research information landscape. Based on our scientometric expertise,
      some projects in this pillar may focus on systematically monitoring and tracking
      the availability of open research information. Drawing on our expertise in sociology,
      anthropology, and science and technology studies, other projects may be aimed
      at describing and explaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread,
      or non-spread, of open information practices.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Intervening</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the intervening pillar we take concrete
      actions to advance openness of research information, aiming to make openness
      of research information the norm and to enable more transparent and responsible
      approaches to decision making in science. An example is the transformation of
      the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS Leiden Ranking</a> to a
      tool that is entirely based on open data, resulting in a fully transparent and
      reproducible ranking. The first release of the Open Edition of the Leiden Ranking
      will take place later this month, on January 30. Another example is the launch
      of the course<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics
      Using Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the<a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\">
      Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course
      took place in November last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this year. Other actions to advance openness of research information are currently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the coming months.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Practicing</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"
      style=\"font-size:14px;\">Following the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019,
      the practicing pillar focuses on implementing openness of research information
      in our own way of working at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work
      at CWTS (including<a href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\"> CWTS BV</a>) to be fully based
      on open research information. In particular, our aim is that future scientometric
      analyses performed by our center will use only data from open sources, such
      as Crossref, DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex, OpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others.
      This is part of a broader ambition to open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance
      in the way we communicate about our research and about other activities of our
      center. This will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for
      <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open science</a>
      and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research
      data management</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Our way of working</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of more
      than 20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities in the
      understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or practicing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest developments around
      open research information, to share updates on ongoing projects and other activities,
      and to make plans for new initiatives.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal areas of CWTS:<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
      target=\"_blank\"> Engagement & Inclusion</a> and Evaluation & Culture. Through
      the<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\"> UNESCO Lab on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science</a>
      we for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information & Openness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\"> GraspOS project</a> and the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra\"
      target=\"_blank\"> CoARA working group on Open Infrastructures for Responsible
      Research Assessment (OI4RRA)</a> demonstrates the value of cross fertilization
      between the Information & Openness and Evaluation & Culture focal areas.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We are also setting up collaborations with external partners working
      on open research information. Many organizations are doing crucial work in this
      area. This ranges from research groups that study openness of research information
      to organizations that provide infrastructures for open research information
      and organizations that put the use of open research information into practice
      (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database\"

      a new research project, we  explore the interaction between misinformation and
      science on social media during COVID-19. This is part of the new research line
      on the role of science in societal debates of our Focal Area Engagement &amp;
      Inclusion.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      past years have shown that science can play an important role in societal debates.
      Science was clearly pivotal in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition,
      many of the interventions and policies, such as masking, school closures or
      even curfews, were presented as evidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific
      advances in our understanding of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific
      findings were part of broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal proponents
      and opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised settings. Although very
      visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, science also plays a large role in other
      societal debates, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180\"
      target=\"_blank\">the nitrogen debate in the Netherlands</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies\"
      target=\"_blank\">climate change</a>.</p><p>As a part of our <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
      target=\"_blank\">Focal Area of Engagement & Inclusion</a> at CWTS, we explore
      the role of science in societal debates. We know that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\"
      target=\"_blank\">science does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates
      or clear course of action for polic</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\">y</a>.
      Some of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal debates,
      are different \u201Csides\u201D informed by different literatures, perhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a common evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead to a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open availability of scientific literature shape the role
      of science in societal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific results differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?
      How do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates? </p><p>In addition
      to science, misinformation also plays a large role in societal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to speak of an <a
      href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic\" target=\"_blank\">infodemic</a>.
      Some of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by fact-checkers,
      such as <a href=\"https://maldita.es/\" target=\"_blank\">maldita.es</a>\r\nin
      Spain, or the local \u201C<a href=\"https://nieuwscheckers.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Nieuwscheckers</a>\u201D
      here at Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness by the
      public, such as \u201C<a href=\"https://askforevidence.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask
      for Evidence</a>\u201D or \u201C<a href=\"https://www.bemediasmart.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop,
      Think, Check</a>\u201D, to help prevent the spread of misinformation. But how
      does science interact with misinformation?</p><h3>Science and misinformation</h3><p>We
      are excited to start a new project on <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed\"
      target=\"_blank\">Understanding Misinformation and Science in Societal Debates
      (UnMiSSeD)</a>. In this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation
      and science during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and qualitative
      approaches. Our quantitative analyses will be limited to Twitter (now X), based
      on more than a billion tweets posted during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined
      with information on millions of publications and tweets about them. We will
      go beyond Twitter in our qualitative analyses to explore how discussions permeate
      the porous boundaries of social media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno
      Kessler (FBK), lead by <a href=\"https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8\" target=\"_blank\">Riccardo
      Gallotti</a> and University of Geneva, lead by <a href=\"http://www.tommasoventurini.it/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Tommaso Venturini</a>. We are happy that this project is supported
      by the <a href=\"https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/\"
      target=\"_blank\">European Media and Information Fund</a>.</p><h3>New perspective</h3><p>At
      CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427\"
      target=\"_blank\">connections between science and society</a>, also in the context
      of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset\"
      target=\"_blank\">COVID-19</a>. We also studied how COVID-19 appeared in <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation\"
      target=\"_blank\">a media outlet</a>. Much of our knowledge on science in social
      media is based on data from <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Altmetric</a>\r\nand
      provides a good lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to being
      mentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from science
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken up. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science is mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes <a href=\"http://modesofexistence.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">where scientific mentions are couched in and interact with
      other ways of knowing the world</a>. In the UnMiSSeD project, our starting point
      are societal debates themselves.  We explore when and how science becomes part
      of such debates, also in relation to misinformation and claims unrelated to
      science. In this way, we hope to better understand the role of science and misinformation
      in societal debates.</p><p>This project brings together a novel combination
      of scientific fields at CWTS. Traditionally, our centre is more focused on science
      (and technology) studies. The UnMiSSeD project brings in not only computational
      social sciences but also media and communication studies and has clear connections
      to science communication. We hope to build out these connections in the near
      future. Watch this blog for future updates on our project.\r\nWe are open to
      explore new opportunities, and if you want to connect to us on this topic, please

      September 2023, the city of Leiden in the Netherlands was the venue for not
      just one, but two scientometrics-related events: the CWTS Scientometrics Summer
      School and the STI 2023 conference. Our author attended both and reflects on
      his experience.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Greetings
      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find myself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey: the CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS<sup>3</sup>) and the 27th International Conference on Science,
      Technology, and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023). As a bibliometrics enthusiast
      for the past two decades, this experience has been nothing short of a revelation\u2014a
      journey that prompted me to question the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.</p><p>Two decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by
      conventional survey field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the
      untapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information Science
      (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the controversial realm of the
      h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the scientific output of Peruvian
      researchers. The journey took a pivotal turn in 2015 when I attended the \u201CMeasuring
      Science and Research Performance\u201D&nbsp;course at CWTS in Leiden, a week
      that unraveled the limitations and detrimental consequences associated with
      relying on the h-index for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.</p><p>Why
      the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal impact
      factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently misused bibliometric
      indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated bibliometric studies, I couldn't
      ignore the grim reality in many South American countries\u2014bibliometric reports
      often perpetuate the status quo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and inform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive citations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks
      rather than addressing pressing regional and local needs.</p><p>Even workshops
      advocating for open science, while championing transparency and accessibility,
      often fell short. Discussions on alternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to downloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access publishing dominates the discourse on open science practices, few
      consider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for example, sharing
      bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential for transparent data analysis.<br></p><figure><img

      2 vevrvolg 11\"><figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023 conference.</figcaption></figure><p>Eight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of returning to
      participate in the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">CS3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\" target=\"_blank\">STI
      2023</a>. These events were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered
      a wealth of perspectives that ignited new possibilities for my own research
      journey. The incorporation of insights from the sociology of science and science
      and technology studies (STS) offered a refreshing lens, challenging us to move
      beyond mere numbers and delve into the social and cultural contexts that shape
      scientific knowledge production. Exploring diverse information sources, beyond
      the confines of established databases, promised a more nuanced understanding
      of scientific impact, particularly in regions often marginalized by traditional
      bibliometric approaches.</p><p>But most importantly, the shared experiences
      and diverse perspectives of colleagues from across the globe truly resonated.
      The STI 2023 conference brought together Global North and South voices, bridging
      the gap between established research powerhouses and emerging scientific ecosystems.
      Through open dialogue and critical reflection, we began to dismantle the monolithic
      assumptions that often underpin bibliometric analysis. We acknowledged the distinct
      dynamics of scientific production in different regions and the varying priorities
      and challenges faced by researchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.</p><p>This
      newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true potential of
      bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating critical perspectives,
      and forging connections across borders, we can transform this field from a passive
      observer into an active agent for positive change. We can use bibliometrics
      not to reinforce existing inequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive
      and equitable scientific landscape, one where research serves the needs of all,
      regardless of their geographic location or economic standing.</p><p>In bidding
      farewell to the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023\"
      target=\"_blank\">Scientometrics Summer School</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">STI 2023 Conference</a>, I can't help but see it as not just
      an end but a promising new beginning. Armed with enriched perspectives, I embark
      on the next chapter of my bibliometric journey, eager to implement the lessons
      learned in contributing to a more equitable and impactful scientific landscape.<br></p><p><span

      50%. Below we discuss the outcomes of the survey.<br></p><h3>Preprinting</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about preprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference submissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the highest score (5), indicating
      they \"like it a lot\", and an additional 37% of the respondents selected the
      second-highest score (4). Only a small minority of 6% of the respondents do
      not support preprinting and selected the lowest (1; \"I don't like it at all\")
      or second-lowest (2) score.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"
      data-image=\"37790\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>When asked what they see as
      advantages and disadvantages of preprinting of conference submissions, respondents
      indicated they appreciate the early access and visibility of research through
      preprinting. The ability to receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen
      as an advantage. In addition, preprinting enables researchers to establish priority
      on emerging topics. However, concerns revolve around the quality assurance of
      preprints, with worries that some submissions represent ongoing work that still
      needs further development, in which case preprinting may undermine the credibility
      of the research. There is also a risk that early-career researchers may feel
      pressured by the open nature of preprints.<br></p><h3>Open peer review</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Support for open peer review is almost as strong as support for
      preprinting. 73% of the survey respondents expressed support for open peer review
      (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents were opposed to open peer review
      (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"
      data-image=\"37805\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents recognized several
      advantages of open peer review, including enhanced transparency, constructive
      feedback, and accountability of reviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns
      about variations in review quality and about the potential impact of negative
      reviews, especially on early-career researchers. Some respondents indicated
      a preference for fully anonymous peer review, to make sure author identities
      do not influence reviewers.<br></p><h3>Future editions of the STI conference</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Survey respondents are very positive about the idea of adopting
      preprinting and open peer review at future editions of the STI conference. 76%
      of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score of 4 or 5), while only 7%
      oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"
      data-image=\"37820\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents also offered suggestions
      for improvement. They would value more thorough reviews, increased transparency
      in the decision-making process, and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents
      recommended improving the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several respondents
      felt there is a need to have a more user-friendly platform for publishing and
      reviewing conference submissions.<br></p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses of the
      Orvium platform</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The opinions of survey respondents about
      the <a href=\"https://dapp.orvium.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Orvium platform</a>,
      which was used to publish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When asked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents
      gave a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative response (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the respondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"
      data-image=\"37843\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents mentioned several
      strengths of the Orvium platform, including the platform's ability to issue
      DOIs, support for having multiple versions of a paper, and the generation of
      \u2018previews\u2019 of papers for convenient reading in a web browser. However,
      a number of weaknesses were also mentioned. While some respondents considered
      the platform easy to use, others found that navigation was challenging and the
      interface confusing. Respondents also reported problems with the platform's
      search function.<br></p><h3>Impact of the STI 2023 conference on open science
      perspectives</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed their ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their views on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already supportive of open science. However, a significant share of the
      respondents found that the conference reinforced their positive views of open
      science. These respondents for instance mentioned that they appreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the conference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the conference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science, such as information overload and problems in quality assurance
      processes.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the outcomes of the
      survey, we consider the experiment with preprinting and open peer review at
      the STI 2023 conference to be successful. While some survey respondents are
      critical, a large majority of the respondents are positive about the experiment.
      Moreover, over three-quarters of the respondents recommend that future editions
      of the STI conference adopt preprinting and open peer review. The feedback provided
      by respondents offers excellent guidance for making further improvements to
      publication and peer review processes at the STI conference, hopefully enabling
      the full potential of open science to be realized.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We

      Transformations: Exploring the technoscience behind our changing relationship
      with the seas</em></a>&nbsp;is organized by Jackie Ashkin in collaboration with
      Sebastian Ureta (Universidad Cat\xF3lica de Chile), Elis Jones (University of
      Exeter), and Jose A. Ca\xF1ada (University of Helsinki). This panel begins from
      the observation that the world\u2019s oceans are in peril. Human actions both
      threaten and promise to save the ocean, but how do technoscientific enterprises
      contribute to transforming human-ocean relations? We invite contributions which
      explore the more-than-human, technoscientific and ethicopolitical dimensions
      of knowing and relating to the ocean.</p><p>Panel number 071, simply entitled
      <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14110\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Seabirds</em></a>
      is organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS, University of Edinburgh and CWTS) with
      Bronte Evans Rayward (SPRI, University of Cambridge) and Oscar Hartman Davies
      (University of Oxford). The Open Panel aims to gather case studies and discussions
      on seabirds to engage with contemporary urgent matters such as environmental
      change and the Anthropocene. We seek to engage with STS topics such as technological
      developments, multispecies and more-than-human studies, and space and its materialities.
      We welcome contributions focused on seabirds or where seabirds play an intriguing
      role in addressing socio-technical matters. What can seabirds teach us? </p><p>Panel
      number 074 explores <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>The limits of Open Research: critical views and new perspectives</em></a>
      and is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open panel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the enactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As the OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying assumption that these values will support the
      evolution of an equitable digital commons and, in consequence, equitable science.
      Nonetheless, simply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design can be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage
      with the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment, raising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful connectivity and digital democratisation.

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Scientific cultures in conflict and transition: Studying
      reform in action</em></a><em>,</em> addresses the recent proliferation of science
      reform movements, including open science, meta-science, responsible research
      and innovation, responsible metrics, and research ssessment reform. These \u2018upstream\u2019
      reform movements seek to address what campaigners consider declining standards
      of quality or propriety around academic knowledge production, communication
      and evaluation within their own professional world. This open panel is co-convened
      by our CWTS colleague Alex Rushforth, together with Bart Penders (Maastricht
      University/Aachen University), and Nicole Nelson (University of Wisconsin Madison).
      They invite case study contributions on one or more scientific reform movement(s)
      which advocate a specific view on the right way to conduct scientific practice(s).</p><p>Panel
      number 154, entitled <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14200\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Making and Doing Oceanic Futures: Mobilising the ocean
      and its materialities between hope and loss</em></a> is organized by Francesco
      Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga. The Panel explores the ocean as
      an object of study and concern&nbsp;in various knowledge and artistic practices.
      It queries how oceanic futures are entangled with hope and loss and how these
      futures intersect with socio-political, scientific, economic, industrial, and
      ecological processes. This panel welcomes traditional presentations and artistic
      contributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken words), and invites interventions
      about the ocean as an object of study and an object of concern.<br></p><p>Panel
      number 299 aims to bring together studies of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>new notions of research quality</em></a><em>. </em>Various
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been adding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing organisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and Thed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel
      invites contributions bringing an STS lens to the study of new quality notions,
      the reform movements that support them and the evaluative situations where they
      count. We seek to generate reflections of theoretical and practical significance
      for (e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality in research assessments.
      The panel will combine academic presentations with an interactive workshop.</p><p>Panel

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing ties between
      academic research and polluting industries</em></a> is organized by Jorrit Smit
      and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration with former colleague Guus Dix (UTwente),
      as well as Shivant Jhagroe and Dominika Czerniawska from other faculties of
      Leiden University. In this panel, we want to explore experimental ways for STS
      to engage with the \u201Ccut the ties\u201D debate around campuses worldwide.
      We aim to host a methodologically diverse gathering in which we can collectively
      \u2018excavate\u2019 data and address pivotal political-epistemic effects of
      ties between extractivist polluting industries and academic research in times
      of climate crisis.</p><p>Panel 340 develops the notion of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>More-than human research and Innovation</em></a>. It is
      organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of Edinburgh) and
      Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The panel seeks to bring
      multispecies studies into onversation with STS focusing especially on the productive
      unruliness of mutlispecies collaboration. We seek to think about in/exclusion
      of other-than human stakeholders and the conceptualization and realization of
      agency in ecological restoration, sustainable agriculture, and other future
      ecologies, as well as environmental science and governance, for example the
      instantiation of the \u201Cdo no significant harm\u201D principle in European
      research and innovation. </p><p>Panel 397 deals with <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Responsible innovation in chemistry</em></a>. It is organized
      by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte Asveld and Britte Bouchaut
      (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht University). Chemical pollution
      is a main driver for global biodiversity loss and the emissions of chemical
      industry contribute substantially to climate change. Regulation often falls
      short of adequately addressing all negative impacts of novel chemicals. This
      session calls for papers addressing the opportunities for and barriers to responsible
      innovation in academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge produced and
      what standards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional frameworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical sector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating with industry? </p><p>The

      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">To develop our
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS knowledge agenda</a> we formed <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">three focal areas</a> at the start of this year to organise
      our activities. Here, we introduce the vision and roadmap of the Focal Area
      Engagement & Inclusion.</p><h3>Our vision</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In today's rapidly
      changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse and inclusive science ecosystem
      that engages with society is of paramount importance. As we navigate complex
      global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence,
      it becomes evident that diverse perspectives, inclusive participation and public
      engagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication are key to unlocking
      science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion <em>envisions studying and promoting diversity and inclusivity in
      the science ecosystem and the engagement and communication between science and
      society.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge
      agenda \u2013 <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening </em>and <em>practising
      </em>\u2013 we developed an ambitious agenda for the study and promotion of
      diversity, inclusion, engagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work will not only contribute to research and teaching around these questions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions, and generate insights
      into how we can implement our findings at our own centre.</p><h3>Representation
      & Inclusiveness</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We believe diversity and inclusivity in the
      global science ecosystem is important. By breaking down barriers to participation
      in science for individuals from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences,
      we enrich the pool of knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which, in
      turn, helps to address scientific and societal challenges more effectively.
      Who gets to participate in science is not always self-evident and requires more
      fundamental understanding and well-considered interventions to improve the inclusion
      and representation of all social groups in science, and the science system as
      a whole.</p><h3>Epistemic Diversity</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Epistemic diversity in
      the science system is of major importance. We need to recognise how different
      topics, research questions, knowledge systems, and actors, including <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040\"
      target=\"_blank\">other-than-human</a> ones, help to produce a fairer and more
      nuanced understanding of complex global issues. By monitoring and promoting
      epistemic diversity, we expect to foster a more inclusive and innovative environment
      where different ways of knowing are valued and incorporated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">For instance, we want to study and address the lack of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development\"
      target=\"_blank\">coverage</a> in mainstream scientometric databases; a problem
      that stands in the way of making important societal topics visible in science
      policy. Consequently, we expect to develop <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>multiversatories</em></a>, policies, and recommendations
      to support funders and science policy with reinforcing epistemic diversity.</p><h3>Engagement
      & Communication</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A research system that is disconnected from
      society is essentially ineffective. Science communication, public engagement
      with science, and participatory approaches for collaborative knowledge production
      are integral building blocks for a stronger and more relevant research and innovation
      ecosystem. Effective science communication and public engagement help to bridge
      the gap between academia and society; help to make scientific approaches and
      knowledge more accessible to the wider public and societal stakeholders (e.g.
      policy makers, industry, etc.); limit the impact of misinformation and the misuse
      of scientific information; and may help to increase public trust in science.
      We will study how society engages with science, in order to improve science
      communication and strengthen the role science can play in society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a
      href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">Citizen science</a> and other participatory approaches can
      create a stronger sense of societal ownership and accountability, turning scientific
      research into a collective societal endeavour. Societal actors outside academia
      contribute to the scientific ecosystem in various ways, for instance with local
      and traditional knowledge or insights from lived experience, or by contributing
      to evidence-informed policy-making. The engagement of societal actors can also
      direct the attention of research to issues of societal importance, increasing
      both their societal relevance and their practical impacts. Engaging other actors,
      such as industry, policy-makers or non-governmental organisations, can help
      with more informed policy, decision-making and innovation. We want to study
      citizen-science practices and how they are changing scientific outcomes, with
      the aim of helping to shape citizen-science further.</p><h3>Accomplishing our
      ambitions</h3><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><br><strong></strong></h4><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Coordination
      of dreams, people, and projects</strong></h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The real treasure
      trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion is all the individual members
      with their own areas of expertise, projects, <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">dreams</a>, and activities. We are a team of more than 30
      colleagues from a variety of backgrounds and career stages.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As
      a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD projects, and personal <em>dreams</em>
      into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised as <em>ambitions</em>!),
      as well as into the existing contractual (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">BV</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects\"
      target=\"_blank\">institute projects</a>, and the work of the <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab\"
      target=\"_blank\">Citizen Science Lab</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"

      each of the three sub-areas to bundle expertise and resources. The working groups
      will bring together a diverse range of colleagues, from within and outside of
      CWTS, each contributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex challenges
      of the sub-areas. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Projects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day
      work at CWTS. Our Focal Area will help coordinate existing projects,  and monitor
      funding opportunities to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning
      projects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving our
      vision and ambitions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central importance for the Focal Area. We think of <a
      href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">dedicated seminars</a>, special sessions at conferences (e.g.
      a special session on \u201C<a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/\"

      this blog post, we examine key historical moments in research assessment, access

      a revolutionary change.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3>Open access: a change in
      publishing with a limited reach</h3><p>Open Access is a movement and policy
      directive dedicated to reforming the closed or subscription-based gatekeeping
      of scientific research. In the subscription-based&nbsp;(when readers pay) model
      scientists communicate the results of their research, by submitting it to publishers,
      and in many cases to one of a small number of large commercial publishers, considered
      to be <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502\"
      target=\"_blank\">an oligopoly</a>. Publishers 'process' this work, then provide
      academic institutions (i.e., libraries) with an 'opportunity' to buy back research
      via journal subscriptions. This is neither sound economically, nor is it conducive
      to the growth of scientific knowledge. Open Access has therefore become a critically
      assessed and well-researched subject, focused on alternative approaches to publishing
      - i.e., green, gold, and hybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees
      (APCs) paid by institutions or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a
      global project there is ample evidence that Open Access has a <a href=\"https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555\"
      target=\"_blank\">limited reach</a>. </p><h3>Journal citation indexing and ranking
      (Assessment)</h3><p>Dr. Eugene Garfield is a renowned figure in certain scientific
      communities for having founded the <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)</a>, and for his
      <a href=\"http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">innovation
      in automated journal citation indexing - the first <em>Science Citation Index</em></a>.
      Dr. Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!); long enough
      to see his <em>Science Citation Index</em> grow to be one of the most useful
      reference tools for scholars and scientometricians worldwide. Today, this index
      has been expanded commercially to include additional products, which are now
      part of Clarivate's trademarked <em>Web of Science\u2122</em>.  </p><p>Dr. Garfield's
      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but develop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal selection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on the minds of other scientists. <a
      href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803\" target=\"_blank\">Gross and Gross
      (1927)</a> are credited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \"<em>What files
      of scientific periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the student
      for advanced work... ?</em>\". The answer was to \"<em>compile a journal list\u201D</em>
      considered to be \"<em>indispensable</em>\", and to base this list on an <em>\"arbitrary
      standard of some kind by which to determine the desirability of purchasing a
      particular journal\"</em> (p. 1713). That arbitrary standard was to focus on
      their citedness. Years later, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Brodman (1944)</a> became a critic of <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803\"
      target=\"_blank\">Gross and Gross's (1922</a>) quantitative method, then shortly
      after, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733\" target=\"_blank\">Fussler
      (1949)</a> took up the task again of listing leading journals. However, it was
      Dr. Garfield, along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who introduced
      the <a href=\"http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Journal Impact Factor (JIF</a>).</p><p>For a long time, <em>the
      Science Citation Index</em> had a positive impact. Although Garfield both witnessed
      and warned against the misuse of the JIF when evaluating individuals, he is
      \u2018blissfully\u2019 unaware of the scale of problems resulting from the <a
      href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x\" target=\"_blank\">use
      of the Journal Impact Factor</a>. Now, we are looking down a long dark hallway
      leading to what some might call '<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/\"
      target=\"_blank\">grimpact</a>'. If we exit this dark hallway, we veer into
      a lit room called 'Open Access', but, how does this relate to research assessment,
      and when did we get here? To answer this, we can go further back in history,
      when science first handed itself over to the profitable business of scholarly
      publishing.</p><h3>The growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)</h3><p>When
      scientific letters, reports, and later periodicals first appeared (i.e., the
      <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em></a>)
      there were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses. Early
      editors, like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the <em>Philosophical
      Transactions</em>), were keen to generate income, but soon recognized how difficult
      it was to process, print, collect subscription fees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses. Commercial publishing grew at one time from
      a legitimate and realistic need. Editors required the support, and were for
      the most part, relieved to hand over the work. In the beginning scientific publishing
      was not profitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses were founded,
      and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals grow at an <a
      href=\"https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159\" target=\"_blank\">exponential
      rate,</a>\r\namounting to more than <a href=\"https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579\"
      target=\"_blank\">30,000</a>, though according to <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent estimates</a>, this number falls woefully short. </p><h3>Digital
      publishing and pay models (Affordability)</h3><p>We have now moved further and
      further away from this print-based history, having stepped firmly into the digital
      age. Digital publishing is less costly, and affords a significantly broader
      reach. However, the commercial subscription model paired with the ISI-Citation
      Index and elite selection of journals (based on the JIF) contributes not only
      to the evaluation problem, but the access problem as well.</p><p>With the legacy
      of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning towards a \u2018flipped\u2019
      publishing economy solution, with an increasing market concentration of academic
      publishers. This development is pushed by science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the acquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models are slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models, but
      we cannot assume that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219\" target=\"_blank\">there
      will always be enough money in the academic system</a>. Some scholars can benefit
      from <a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Plan S</a>,
      which allows them to rely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately accessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research
      shows that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for publication,
      <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574\" target=\"_blank\">consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a highly-ranked journal</a>. Empirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">knowledge production is consolidated around the JIF.</a> Many
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185\"
      target=\"_blank\">strong age bias</a>. And, in the age of AI, new empirical
      research has found that a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">journal\u2019s impact factor is a bad predictor for \u2018thoroughness\u2019
      and \u2018helpfulness\u2019 of reviews.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, it seems more
      important than ever to ask ourselves how we can continue with Open Access, when
      the technology behind indexing, and the journal reputation economy has added
      to continued problems.<br></p><h3>Open Access Ideology<br></h3><p>Most academics
      are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open Access ideologists. Certain
      ideologists may be refusing to publish content in any journal which is currently
      not freely available and fully accessible. Some might even refuse to carry out
      peer review for publishers that they do not respect <em>(note: Why should I
      volunteer my time and efforts to support a greedy industry?)</em></p><p>An approach
      like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though it is meant to put
      pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is socially and scientifically
      unaffordable for many members of our broader scientific community, especially
      <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars\"
      target=\"_blank\">at a time when peer review is in crisis</a>. Scholars are
      responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst this tension between
      open access and paywalled content. The last thing that we need is fewer reviewers
      to call upon, or at least one less in situations where certain researchers have
      little choice but to publish in one of the commercially indexed, paywalled journals.</p><p>Perhaps
      support for Open Access no longer demands that we focus<em> solely </em>on current
      ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it not time to exit the well-lit OA-room
      and trip down that long dark hallway again, towards a radically new, and disruptive
      socio-technical innovation?</p><h3>Socio-Technical Innovation</h3><p>The creation
      of a systemic change, or shift in perceptions and behaviour patterns within
      our global scientific community implies that <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&\"
      target=\"_blank\">innovation starts with some sort of \u2018symbolic strategy\u2019</a>.
      A strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to relinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially in evaluation systems.</p><p>Dr.
      Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He took us from the print
      age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced to the semantic Web,
      and now we are at the development stages of Web 5.0 - the open, linked, and
      intelligent Web. Let us not forget that <a href=\"https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web\"
      target=\"_blank\">Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s idea behind the Web in the first place
      was to keep track of scientific information</a>! In addition to a symbolic shift
      within the scientific/scholarly communication system we can move towards a material
      or tangible shift.</p><p>Imagine, therefore; a reputation economy in science/scholarship,
      which is not attached to journal rank and title. What is a scientific journal,
      if not its editor-in-chief, editorial board, and thousands of volunteer academics
      worldwide who peer review submitted manuscripts? Many, if not most scholars
      believe in preserving the journal, and we will likely find it difficult to forget
      about them. Journals perform a constituent and organising role; a tangible outlet
      for scientific fields and disciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more
      radical solutions, we might rather focus on preserving the registering, curating,
      evaluating, disseminating, and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping
      in mind that<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>their real value</em> lies in the communities that they
      create.</a></p><p>Editors and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo
      journal <em>titles </em>altogether and exit a commercial publisher (Note: <a
      href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1\"
      target=\"_blank\">Exits do happen, as in the case of an editor and editorial
      board leaving a commercial publisher to form a new Open Access journal</a>).
      In Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if \u2018by any other name\u2019 the
      rose would \u2018smell as sweet!\u2019 (i.e., journal name is different, but
      the editorial community is the same, and scholars continue to respect that editorial
      community)? In a similar vein, editorial boards might be encouraged to leave
      a commercial publisher, and move to an Open Access International Scholarship
      Space: A space <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh\" target=\"_blank\">focused
      on managing and maintaining digitally transformed scholarly records</a>, which
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to any future
      needs.</p><p>Imagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a topic management center of their own creation (i.e., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007\"
      target=\"_blank\">a kind of digital library</a> or <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/5564003\"
      target=\"_blank\">scholarly digital infrastructure</a>). At each online center,
      there could be a description of the topic area, including the specialty research
      areas of the editorial team. So, for example, if we renounce a commercially
      published journal called the \u201C<em>Journal of the Information Age</em>\u201D
      and renounce the titled journal called \u201C<em>Quantitative Studies of Quantitativeness</em>\u201D,
      our international community would then think about putting an article up for
      review at the \u201CA Topic-Editorial Team\u201D or the \u201CB Topic-Editorial
      Team\u201D.</p><p> Whatever solution we choose, it starts with abandoning journal
      titles and rank then shifting to an innovative international socio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result would still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued according to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer review.</p><p>This solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may not necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly prescriptive here. However, it would put the
      scholarly record keeping firmly back into our own hands, and not in the hands
      of commercial ownership, though any kind of solution can include some commercial
      service providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support; style-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to other issues, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8\"
      target=\"_blank\">challenges associated with peer review</a>. Taking such steps
      would be difficult, but we believe that the international science community
      is ready, and that there is more to gain through technological innovation.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><span

      this blog post, we&#039;ll introduce you to the CWTS ECR/PhD Council, shedding
      light on its significance, objectives, and how it can serve as a crucial resource
      for early career researchers and PhDs at CWTS.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>CWTS is an interdisciplinary
      institute at Leiden University with a diverse multinational academic culture.
      PhD candidates, early career researchers, and visiting scholars from around
      the world gather at CWTS to pursue their research journeys. The journey can
      be an inspiring yet challenging experience. It might be filled with research,
      innovation, and personal growth, but it can also be a journey that feels isolating
      at times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers need to spend extended
      periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of detachment from the broader
      social and academic community. Loneliness can be particularly challenging for
      our PhD candidates, early career researchers and visiting researchers who have
      transitioned to a new, unfamiliar environment. To counter this and to create
      a dynamic and supportive community, in September, we have started an Early Career
      Researcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian Xie as the Chair
      and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.</p><h3> What does it
      mean to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?</h3><p>There is more
      to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It assumes full involvement
      in the research process, from generating ideas to implementing them practically.
      The research process includes not only conducting research but also actively
      participating in academic events such as seminars, conferences, symposia, and
      round tables. Here, PhD candidates can exchange experiences with peers, discuss
      their ideas, and become familiar with new methods and approaches in their field
      of knowledge.</p><p>Being a PhD candidate also entails constant self-development
      and self-education. It is necessary to continuously update one's knowledge,
      monitor new trends and discoveries in their field. Ultimately, all of this contributes
      to the development of the PhD candidates\u2019 professional skills, their readiness
      for independent research activities, and successful careers.</p><p>To some extent,
      the same holds true for early career researchers \u2013 not only the PhD candidates.
      Early career researchers are people taking their first steps in a academic career.
      They have a fresh and critical view of the world, full of energy and desire
      to contribute to the development of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues
      are doing research without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we need
      to include them as well, since some of their struggles are the same. </p><p>To
      provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we established the ECR/PhD
      Council.</p><h3>What is the ECR/PhD Council?</h3><p>The ECR/PhD Council is a
      small, dedicated body (currently consisting of two members) within CWTS that
      brings together PhDs and early career researchers. The Council is committed
      to the promotion of internal communication, coordination of supportive and networking
      activities, and social cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community. At the same time,
      the Council is the formal connection between the ECRs and PhDs and the CWTS
      PhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.</p><h3>What are we planning to
      do?</h3><ul><li>Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD can often
      feel like a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive community
      where individuals can connect, share experiences, and provide emotional support
      to one another. The Council members also take the lead in organizing non-academic
      related meetings and informal ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the well-being
      and social needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits. For instance,
      introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and pub-quizzes. </li><li>Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for networking with peers, mentors
      and potential collaborators, opening doors to new research opportunities. The
      Council holds monthly ECR/PhD internal seminars. These meetings will be held
      in hybrid format and in English to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD candidates
      may present and discuss academic work (proposals, results, papers, posters).
      We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts farewell meetings for
      early career researchers, providing them with the opportunity to present the
      research they have conducted during their time at CWTS. Of course, this event
      is not mandatory but highly encouraged.</li><li>Buddy system: New CWTS PhD candidates
      are now offered the opportunity to be paired with a senior CWTS PhD candidate
      (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD candidate). External PhD candidates will also benefit
      from this system. </li><li>Providing insights to the CWTS Management Board.
      </li></ul><ol></ol><h3>What has happened so far?</h3><p>Our experience of joining
      the ECR/PhD Council has been great so far! It\u2019s not just about attending
      meetings and organizing events. It\u2019s all about being part of a supportive
      and dynamic academic community. Here\u2019s what the experience has been like:</p><ul><li>Community
      Building:  We\u2019ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow PhD students
      and early career researcher from various fields, which has broadened our perspective.
      </li><li>Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered
      by the council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our knowledge
      base. </li><li>Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice
      our needs and concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It\u2019s
      empowering to know that our interests are being represented.</li><li>Collaboration
      and Leadership: We\u2019ve already been encouraged to take on leadership roles
      within the council, which we hope will allow us to develop leadership and teamwork
      skills.  </li></ul><p>On October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming
      meeting, at which the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc had a chance to introduce
      their research. The chairman of the Council also introduced all issues relevant
      to do a PhD at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services offered to PhDs, PhD trainings
      and courses, etc.). Even though the meeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing
      terrible happened. On the contrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly
      atmosphere.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"

      prepared food for all participants, and one of our colleagues even taught others
      how to roll spring rolls. It was not only a fascinating cultural experience
      but also an excellent way to strengthen relationships.<br></p><p>If you would

      target=\"_blank\">Does science need heroes?\u201D</a></em> attempted to explore
      the evolution of prize cultures over time and examine the current and potential
      roles of prizes in contemporary scientific practices. I would like to thank
      Ad Maas, Curator of Modern Natural Sciences of Rijksmuseum Boerhaave and professor
      in Museological Aspects of the Natural Sciences at the Centre for the Arts in
      Society of Leiden University, for inviting me to give a comment on the second
      day of the symposium. This blog post is an adaptation of the talk I gave there.<em></em><em></em></p><p><em>Does
      science need heroes?</em> Spoken like a proper academic, my answer to this question
      would be: yes and no.</p><p>Let me start with the latter.</p><p>No, the last
      thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What it does need is structural
      reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including various forms of bias, structural
      inequality, lack of transparency and rigor, excessive competition, commercialization,
      and vanity publishing. It is unhealthy for researchers to want to be a hero
      in the current system.</p><p>But also: yes! Science is in dire need of heroes!
      Because the science system needs to reform, we need different types of people
      who can lead the way and set an example with good leadership. This is what I
      want to address in this commentary.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img

      and inspired by Museum Boerhaave's wonderful collection, I will go back to the
      19<sup>th</sup> century, when the first university ranking was conceived. People
      often think the first ranking appeared around the 2000s, with the publication
      of the first commercial ranking. But that is not true. As is more often the
      case, problematic metrics for assessing excellence are in fact invented by scientists
      themselves!</p><p>A few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist
      James McKeen Cattell <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">with two of my colleagues</a>. Cattell lived from 1860 to
      1944, served as the long-time editor of the journal <em>Science</em>, and his
      primary academic interest was the study of 'eminence', a somewhat ambiguous
      concept that I translate here as excellence, eminence, or greatness. There is
      an interesting connection between Cattell's work on 'eminence' as the primary
      'virtue' of individual researchers and the contemporary university rankings
      of the most prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning universities with
      the most flourishing research and best teaching environments.</p><p>Cattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where he eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell, and many other contemporaries
      interested in 'eminence' or greatness, observed a decrease in the number of
      'great men' compared to earlier periods, which they found concerning. They feared
      the biological degeneration of the population, and this fear was exacerbated
      by a more general concern about the decline of the British Empire. This fear
      was further intensified by the rise of industrialization, democratization, and
      a growing working class. The preoccupation with 'great men' was also reflected
      in a growing interest in the role of the scientist in a time when scientific
      work increasingly became a 'profession' among other professions. The scientific
      method of eugenics gave Cattell the tools to classify 'eminence' in a new way.
      His idea was that professors could be placed on a single ranked list based on
      peer review. He asked a large number of scientists to create a list, ranking
      scientists from the most to the least prominent, based on a selection of names
      provided in advance. High \"output\" was insufficient as an indicator of 'eminence';
      it was primarily about reputation among peers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous. Cattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the men on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and especially the university where researchers had received their education.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes: he mapped how 'scientific
      eminence' was distributed across cities and universities. And I quote from a
      piece in 1903: \"We can tell whether the average scientific standard in one
      part of the country or at a certain university is higher or lower than elsewhere;
      we can also quantitatively map the scientific strength of a university or department.\"
      So, initially, Cattell's lists were not compiled with the purpose of comparing
      institutions, but the information these instruments provided was indeed used
      for these comparisons.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/tblCattell.png\"

      universities in a single year</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>Cattell's study
      of scientific men and his subsequent ranking of universities was deeply rooted
      in a larger debate about the role of the scientist. The ideal image of a researcher
      was evolving significantly at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
      century, as I think is happening again today. But back then, older ideas about
      the gentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly juxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of science as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with excellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about what universities are exactly for today! </p><p></p><p>Over
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have introduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent research. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in science, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy instruments have in the past decades started to
      shape our perception of excellent science through an interactive feedback loop
      between policy on the one hand and the practice of doing research on the other.
      An excellent researcher\u2019s standing is now primarily determined by their
      research production. This is partly still science as a profession that Cattell
      and others instigated, but this profession is now saturated with key performance
      indicators (like a lot of other professions in neoliberal democratic societies).
      The primary tactical and strategic aims have become competing for (ever decreasing
      amounts of) research income, and publishing in prestigious journals, and aiming
      for a Nobel Prize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards have become important
      parts of academic CVs. And because of gender and other diversity gaps, this
      makes it harder for women and other minority groups to make a career in science.
      University rankings use prizes and awards as input, and this trickles down in
      university policies. Universities over the past decades have started to think
      in terms of globalised economic markets for excellent researchers.</p><p>The
      motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one point made sense, and
      Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously, and this is not often
      acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with the way we measure excellence.
      If we are truly honest: current notions of excellence and metrics-driven assessment
      criteria are threatening to shape the content of the work and the diversity
      of the subject matter. We are observing that research is designed and adjusted
      in a way that ensures a good score. We see that people are choosing research
      questions not just based on interest or importance, but also to improve their
      chances of getting a job. This <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018thinking with indicators\u2019</a> is obviously problematic
      for science when important research questions are not being addressed and even
      become \u2018unthinkable\u2019.</p><p>This type of thinking also has consequences
      for the space in academia for what you could call \u2018social\u2019 elements.
      Think of decreasing collegiality, less commitment to the community, or bad leadership.
      And if we're mostly noticing and applauding the 'big names,' those veteran academics
      with a significant reputation, we are hurting the opportunities for talented
      newcomers and other team members who play crucial roles. What worries me is
      that the pressure in many places is so high that ambitious young researchers
      think they cannot go on holiday because otherwise their work will be \u2018scooped\u2019.
      Competitiveness can create feelings of constant failure among early career researchers,
      as they may never feel they meet the required standards. And even those who
      are at the top, and we have interviewed many, often feel they must continue
      to work ever harder to keep out-competing others. Group leaders and heads of
      department warn each other about the health risks that they run by chronically
      working very hard, year after year. This is an actual quote from an actual interview:<br></p><p>The
      example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour \r\nto their
      younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a \r\nweek, and
      that if people can\u2019t keep up, they are not fit for the \r\nChampions League.
      These senior researchers have really internalised that\r\n this is what it takes
      to play the game, and that if you can\u2019t stand the\r\n heat, you should
      get out of the kitchen. But let\u2019s face it, that \r\nkitchen is on fire.</p><p>For
      one, we have globally had several severe integrity and \r\nreproducibility crises.
      We have seen the shadow side of competition, \r\nwhere researchers focus too
      much on finding new things and trying to do \r\nthat quickly, even if that means
      that they might not be doing \r\nhigh-quality research. Of course, we all want
      to tell our students to \r\ndream big and ideally, we also provide them with
      the protected space to \r\ndevelop their own research and strive for the highest
      quality. However, \r\nif in the meantime we also encourage them to focus on
      chasing after \r\ngroundbreaking results and judge success mainly by how many
      times our \r\nwork gets cited by others, we create a culture where short-termism
      and \r\nrisk aversion thrive. This culture is today also driven by a pressure
      to\r\n secure funding in competitive four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes
      it\r\n very hard for researchers to do long-term, risky projects, or work in
      \r\nfields that have a big impact on society but don't get cited as much, \r\nlike
      applied sciences or social sciences. As a result, research agendas \r\ndon't
      always focus on what society really needs. Also, all this \r\ncompetition can
      make scientists less likely to collaborate, which is \r\ncrucial for solving
      complex problems. </p><p>To make science better, we need to change our priorities,
      and support\r\n a wider range of research. We very urgently need more diverse
      \r\nperspectives and inclusive participation in science. <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/\"
      target=\"_blank\">We need to collaborate and open up,</a>\r\n simply because
      what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the \r\nproblem-solving capacity
      of science alone. And that is why we also \r\nreally need to rethink the criteria
      for excellent research. These \r\ncriteria need to be more inclusive, because
      research evaluation has the \r\npower to affect the culture of research; individual
      career trajectories \r\nand researchers\u2019 well-being; the quality of evidence
      informing policy \r\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in research and
      research \r\nfunding.</p><p>I would also like to address a misunderstanding
      about the Dutch <a href=\"https://recognitionrewards.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018recognition
      and rewards\u2019 program</a>.\r\n I often hear a concern that the program wants
      to wishy-washily include \r\neveryone and forgets about upholding excellence.
      I do not think that \r\nthis is a fair portrayal of the program. At its core,
      the program is \r\nabout an honest look in the mirror, and about fixing what
      is broken. The\r\n program is part of a much larger set of national, regional,
      and global \r\ninitiatives including the <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DORA
      Declaration</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/520429a\"

      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a>.</p><p>All these
      initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think \r\nevaluation. And we need
      other types of leaders and heroes in academia, \r\nwho will work together to
      implement responsible forms of research \r\nassessment. We should stop sending
      each other the message that \r\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is
      always more we need to do \r\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful,
      we need to invest more\r\n in building strong academic communities that value
      collaboration and \r\nshare a commitment to advancing research and teaching,
      while making a \r\npositive impact on and with society.</p><p>One of my heroes
      in life is Pippi Langstr\xF6m, or Pippie Langkous in \r\nDutch. I used to watch
      her show when I was little. Pippi has this \r\nsaying: \u201CI have never tried
      this before, so I think I should definitely \r\nbe able to do that.\u201D I
      love it. And I believe that we need to reward \r\nthis type of behaviour more
      than we currently do in academia, sadly. We \r\nshould foster taking risks,
      trying something new, stepping out of our \r\ncomfort zone, and being bold whilst
      not taking ourselves too seriously. \r\nBut in fact, we see the opposite happen
      among early career researchers. \r\nMany of them suffer from <a href=\"https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306_Improving-mental-health-of-early-career-researchers-2.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">anxiety and an unhealthy pressure to conform to a problematic
      norm</a>. Helping to change that was one of my drivers to be part of <a href=\"https://rijksmuseumboerhaave.nl/symposium-does-science-need-heroes/\"

      the CWTS Leiden Ranking and the INORMS More Than Our Rank initiative announce
      a new partnership, aimed at highlighting the accomplishments of universities

      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS Leiden Ranking</a> has always been a bit different from
      other university rankings. It has never sought to identify an overall \u2018winner\u2019
      from amongst all the universities it features, preferring instead to offer a
      range of indicators and rank institutions on each one separately. It also looks
      beyond traditional citation measures and reputation surveys to assess concepts
      such as open access and gender balance. In addition, it presents its indicators
      in a number of different ways, not only in the traditional format of a ranked
      list of universities but also in two-dimensional charts and in a world map.
      The Leiden Ranking team has also consistently emphasised the importance of <a
      href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse\" target=\"_blank\">responsible
      use of university rankings</a>.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Today the Leiden Ranking
      takes a next step in promoting responsible ways of dealing with university rankings.
      By partnering with the <a href=\"https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/\" target=\"_blank\">INORMS
      More Than Our Rank initiative</a>, the Leiden Ranking highlights that, notwithstanding
      any value that rankings may have, institutions are so much more than their rank.<br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The More Than Our Rank initiative was launched in October 2022 to
      provide all universities, whether top ten or yet to place, with an opportunity
      to show how much more they have to offer the world than is captured in the global
      university rankings. Signatories simply add the More Than Our Rank logo to their
      website and provide a statement showcasing their activities, achievements and
      ambitions. A small, but growing, number of pioneering universities have become
      early signatories, supported by a wide range of international university associations,
      ranking providers and responsible research assessment groups, including the
      Leiden Ranking.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As of today, the Leiden Ranking has taken
      its commitment to More Than Our Rank one step further: All More Than Our Rank
      signatories that appear in the Leiden Ranking are highlighted on the ranking
      website by presenting the More Than Our Rank logo next to their institution
      name (see the screenshots below). Visitors to the website will be able to click
      on the link on each institution\u2019s profile to visit the More Than Our Rank
      website and view an institution\u2019s More Than Our Rank statement. <br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Participating in the More Than Our Rank initiative is a risk-free
      way for institutions to emphasise their strengths not captured by global rankings.

      key challenge in the reform of research assessment is to recognise and reward
      the adoption of open scientific practices. In this post, Anestis Amanatidis
      reflects on this challenge and invites you to join the conversation in bimonthly
      online meetings.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Research
      assessment practices that largely rely on publication-driven assessments of
      research(ers) are slowly running out of steam. A remnant of a science system
      that is largely inward-focused and output-oriented, these assessments paint
      a rather monochrome picture of science that is not fit for today\u2019s developments
      that reconfigure the relationship between science and society.</p><p>One such
      reconfiguration that enjoys a lot of attention at the moment comes under the
      banner of open science. It has become a powerful device for reconfiguring scientific
      research and is currently the centre of immense policy attention on all levels:</p><p>UNESCO
      describes it as a policy framework to address existing inequalities that are
      produced through science, technology and innovation vis-\xE1-vis environmental,
      social and economic challenges in their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Open Science</a>. The text seems to be bearing
      considerable hope for fostering science practices that are open, transparent,
      collaborative and inclusive by valuing quality and integrity, collective benefits,
      equity and fairness, and diversity and inclusiveness as core values.</p><p>Also,
      the European Commission embraced open science as a policy priority with considerable
      investment in the development of the \u2018European Open Science Cloud\u2019
      as a central platform to publish, find and reuse research assets. Simultaneously,
      European funding prioritises open science practices in the form of sharing of
      publications and data \u2018as open as possible and as closed as necessary\u2019.</p><p>Indeed
      it seems that these policy investments do carry fruits as can be seen in the
      formation of national bodies, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openscience.nl/en\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Science Netherlands</a>, that were heralded as supporting
      the advancement of open science on country-level or the evident&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/strategic-plan-2025.\"
      target=\"_blank\">inclusion of open science in university strategies</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless,
      open science is also a&nbsp;terribly ambiguous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018umbrella term\u2019</a>&nbsp;that is enacted in multiple
      ways across different research communities. Conceptions range from purely output-oriented
      notions surrounding open access to process-oriented priorities, such as engaging
      non-academics in knowledge production. As my colleagues Ismael Rafols and Ingeborg
      Meijer summarise in their blogpost on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led\"
      target=\"_blank\">monitoring open science</a>:<br></p><p>When relating this
      ambiguity to research(er) assessment, it becomes evident that the proliferation
      of open science practices challenges the monochromatic properties of publication-driven
      research(er) assessments. This urges research assessment to be reconsidered
      in the light of open science. Luckily, there has been much work in making research(er)
      assessment more polychromatic. This has been spearheaded by initiatives such
      as <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/about-dora/\" target=\"_blank\">DORA</a>, has
      stabilised with the formulation of the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong Principles</a> and recently has institutionalised
      in the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Coalition for Advancing
      Research Assessment</a> (COARA); a massive undertaking that supports the adoption
      of responsible research assessment practices across knowledge producing organisations.
      Indeed, CoARA\u2019s description on their webpage summarises briefly what responsible
      research assessment means for them:</p><p>Similarly to open science,<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/navigating-responsible-research-assessment-guidelines#:~:text=RRA%20%22is%20an%20umbrella%20term,diverse%20and%20inclusive%20research%20cultures.%22\"
      target=\"_blank\"> responsible research assessment describes a broad range of
      aspirations</a> in research assessment that largely focus on the responsible
      use of research metrics in assessment contexts and the fostering of an inclusive
      and diverse research culture in science through assessment. These developments
      in research assessment recognise and promote practices that paint a more polychromatic
      picture of science, where research(ers) are recognised and rewarded for more
      than the outputs they produce.</p><p>Both developments \u2013 open science and
      responsible research assessment \u2013 have a unique opportunity to strengthen
      and reinforce one another. Research assessment reform can provide the institutional
      incentives to the adoption of open scientific practices in research, and the
      diversity of practices promoted under open science can serve the reform of research(er)
      assessment. However, despite this promising interrelation, both movements risk
      developing in parallel to one another as long as questions about the aspirations
      of open science are not discussed with the affordances of responsible research
      assessment in mind. </p><p>Indeed, there is ongoing work to illuminate these
      complexities in the form of various European Commission-funded projects. How
      research(er) assessment that considers opens science can play out in practice
      is being researched by <a href=\"https://graspos.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">GraspOS</a>,
      a project which is concerned with how infrastructures afford the uptake of research
      assessment that values open science. The project <a href=\"https://opusproject.eu/about/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OPUS</a> focuses on indicators for the assessment of researchers
      in the context of open science. <a href=\"https://pathos-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">PathOS</a>
      tries to better understand the impacts of open science. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/transition-in-science/\"
      target=\"_blank\">SUPER MoRRI</a> project developed an <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i\">evaluation
      and monitoring framework</a> for responsible research and innovation in Europe
      that, in many ways, relates to reconfigurations in knowledge production as posited
      under the banner of open science as well. </p><p>Early reflections from these
      projects and related communities can be brought forward with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009416368\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sabina Leonelli\u2019s recent book (2023)</a>. She describes
      open science as backed by a rationale that relies on a strong orientation towards
      the sharing of objects of science. These objects do not necessarily describe
      how research is done, but are themselves (by)products of research, including
      data, publications, models, codes et cetera. In this notion of science, <em>access
      </em>to existing scholarship and related objects becomes conditional for successful
      open science. </p><p>Indeed, this notion of open science is widely shared and
      is often reinforced in research(er) assessments that consider open science through
      the enrolment of object-oriented knowledge that comes in the form of indicators
      describing e.g., open access outputs. However, these research assessments only
      make visible a very narrow interpretation of openness in science and obscure
      descriptions of how research <em>is done</em> \u2013 which is a key consideration
      for recognising and rewarding researchers on responsible conduct of research,
      transdisciplinary work and other \u2018broader\u2019 interpretations that can
      be found in the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO</a> conceptualisation of openness; and often remain
      invisible.</p><p>This gives rise to interesting questions about capturing immaterial
      properties of research, in particular when it comes to shared knowledge production
      processes and how they reconfigure values and relations or bring up matters
      of collective concern. These dimensions of research are still widely underrepresented
      and unaddressed in research(er) assessments in the context of (open) science.
      </p><p>Conclusively, research(er) assessment that considers open science is
      still in a nascent stage. It is therefore critical to collate and exchange experiences
      of practical attempts to conduct research assessment that considers open science.
      At GraspOS, we will ask these questions in bimonthly online meetings starting
      18 October 2023 and present ongoing stories from universities, national funders,
      thematic research clusters to discuss the multiple ways in which (responsible)
      research assessment considers open science. </p><p>We hope to hear stories about
      issues, frustrations and successes of research assessment in relation to open
      science. Finally, the goal of this community is to create a bouquet of stories
      from which we can learn and draw inspiration for our own research assessments.

      \                                               <p>Since their inception in
      2003, global university rankings have gained increasing prominence within the
      higher education landscape. Originally designed as marketing and benchmarking
      tools, the rankings have transformed into influential instruments for research
      evaluation and policymaking. Acknowledging the vast impact they have had on
      the field, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hykze\" target=\"_blank\">my
      recent study</a> aims to provide an extensive overview of the literature pertaining
      to the use of university rankings in research evaluation and excellence initiatives.</p><p>The
      paper presents a systematic review of existing literature on rankings in the
      context of research evaluation and excellence initiatives. English-language
      sources primarily constitute the basis of this review, although additional coverage
      is given to literature from Russia, where the significance of rankings in the
      national policy was emphasized in the title and objective of the policy project
      5top100 (the review covers only a relatively small part of Russian-language
      literature on rankings; an extended study of the Russian academic literature
      is available <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9gdy2\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).
      Furthermore, gray literature has also been included for a comprehensive understanding
      of the topic.</p><h3><strong>The attitudes towards university rankings and their
      use in research evaluation in academic and gray literature</strong></h3><p>The
      literature analysis reveals a prevailing academic consensus that rankings should
      not be employed as a sole measure of research assessment and indicators of the
      national policies. Rankings can be used for marketing and benchmarking functions,
      but in a responsible way by recognizing their limitations. Various authors have
      highlighted technical and methodological flaws, biases of different nature (including
      biased evaluation of both universities and individual researchers), conflicts
      of interest, and risks to national identity. Criticism is mainly focused on
      rankings that use a composite indicator as a single overall measure of university
      performance (QS, THE, and ARWU). Rather few studies demonstrate a positive or
      neutral attitude towards global university rankings. The key findings from the
      literature are summarized in the diagram below.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Picture1.jpg\"
      data-image=\"35814\"><figcaption style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\">Figure
      1: Map of views on global university rankings and their use in research evaluation</figcaption></figure><p><br>It
      is noteworthy to observe that the perception of global university rankings in
      gray publications has undergone a substantial evolution. During the 2000s and
      early 2010s, there existed a favorable outlook on university rankings, with
      policymakers and certain academics endorsing their use to gauge the excellence
      of higher education institutions on a global scale, to some extent. In recent
      years, there has been a discernible shift in the perspective in the gray literature
      towards university rankings, becoming more inclined towards a critical view.</p><h3>Rankings
      and research evaluation in the Russian science system</h3><p>Rankings played
      an incredibly significant role in Russian national policy. In 2013-2020, the
      Russian government implemented the 5top100 project aimed at getting five Russian
      universities into the top 100 of global university rankings. The goal of the
      project was not achieved, but some experts noted positive changes, primarily
      an increase in the number of publications by Russian universities. The 5top100
      project was continued within the framework of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia\"
      target=\"_blank\">Priority-2030 program</a>. This ongoing policy initiative
      is also aimed at promoting the development and advancement of national universities.
      One distinct aspect of this program is its rejection of global university rankings
      as the sole basis of evaluation. By moving away from a narrow reliance on global
      rankings, the program aims to foster a more holistic and context-specific approach
      to assessing the performance and progress of Russian universities. However,
      a considerable proportion of evaluation in Priority-2030 still depends on quantitative
      indicators also used in the methodologies of global university rankings, in
      particular the scoring of publications based on the indexing of journals in
      Scopus or Web of Science.</p><p>Despite the <a href=\"https://ach.gov.ru/statements/byulleten-schetnoy-palaty-2-279-2021-g\"
      target=\"_blank\">rosy reports</a> of Russian universities moving up in the
      rankings and increasing their publications, it suddenly turned out that the
      country did not have enough technological competencies to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.ru/biznes/484319-avtovaz-peresel-na-vypusk-lada-v-treh-cvetah-iz-za-deficita-kraski\"
      target=\"_blank\">produce car paint</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/business/02/02/2023/63d68c1b9a79473f53d7403b\"
      target=\"_blank\">starter cultures for dairy products</a>. The situation appears
      to be even more concerning when examining the analysis of ranking positions
      for 28 Russian universities that sought consulting services from Quacquarelli
      Symonds (QS) between 2016 and 2021 (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00942-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">the analysis by Igor Chirikov</a>). The findings revealed
      an unusual increase in ranking positions that could not be justified by any
      observable changes in the universities' characteristics, as indicated by national
      statistics. This phenomenon, termed \"self-bias\" by the author, raises questions
      about the validity of these rankings. It is worth noting that in the latest
      edition of the QS ranking, all Russian universities experienced a significant
      decline in their positions. This begs the question: were Russian universities
      performing well previously, and has there been a noticeable deterioration in
      their activities lately? Overall, it is my belief that relying solely on university
      rankings cannot provide a reliable answer to these inquiries.</p><p>Back to
      the literature review, I must admit that the scope of topics covered in Russian-language
      literature regarding rankings is remarkably limited, with the dominant theme
      revolving around competitiveness. Furthermore, there is a striking lack of overlap
      between academic and gray literature in Russian compared to English-language
      sources. In fact, the only point of intersection is the neo-colonial discourse,
      which considers rankings as a tool for promoting the Western model of higher
      education. Some authors also point out the difference between the Western and
      Russian model of higher education, for instance, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.33933/2074-2762-2019-54-134-144\"
      target=\"_blank\">Lazar (2019)</a>. In Western countries, science and higher
      education have traditionally coexisted within universities, with applied research
      being actively developed through the participation of businesses. In contrast,
      in Russia, since the times of the USSR, there has been a \"research triad\"
      consisting of the Academy of Sciences, industry design bureaus, and research
      institutes, while universities and industry institutes have primarily focused
      on personnel training with government funding. As a result, both fundamental
      and applied research has historically been largely conducted outside of universities
      in Russia.</p><p>The topic of responsible research evaluation is poorly developed
      in Russia. Regrettably, this indicates the isolated nature of Russian science
      and educational policy debates, which obviously hampers the prospects for development.
      </p><h3>What to do in this situation?</h3><p>I believe the problem described
      above concerns not only Russia. Although the degree of influence is different,
      the rankings continue to shape national and institutional strategies in higher
      education practically all over the world.</p><p>I have emphasized the inherent
      complexity of dismissing rankings outright since they continue to serve as effective
      marketing tools. Having said that, I must also acknowledge the complexity of
      cultural change. Even now <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-2272-2022-22-4-909-918\"
      target=\"_blank\">some people believe</a> that university rankings measure the
      international prestige of the country <em>\u201Cbased on the objective assessment
      by experts from different countries of the significant achievements of universities.\u201D</em></p><p>A
      <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/nieuws-detail/nieuwsbericht/915-p-dutch-universities-to-take-different-approach-to-rankings-p.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent report by the Universities of the Netherlands</a> proposed
      a strategy deal with university rankings in more responsible ways. This entails
      the implementation of initiatives at three levels. In the short term, universities
      should embark on individual initiatives. In the medium term, coordinated initiatives
      should be undertaken at the national level, such as collaborative efforts by
      all universities in the Netherlands. In the longer term, coordinated initiatives
      are to be set up at the international level.</p><p>At present, I would suggest
      focusing on several specific stops:</p><ul><li>Stop evaluating academics based
      on university ranking indicators. Start rewarding the contributions of faculty
      and researchers in all areas of university activities.</li><li>Stop constructing
      university strategies based on university rankings. Do not use ranking tiers
      in analytical reports for management decision making; instead, focus on the
      actual contributions made by a university (scientific, educational, and societal).</li><li>Stop
      evaluating universities based on ranking indicators. Every university has a
      unique mission, and only fulfillment of this mission really matters.</li><li>Stop
      using ranking information in national strategies and other kinds of ambitions.
      Only universities\u2019 contributions to national and global goals should be
      considered.</li><li>Stop paying money for consulting services to ranking compliers.
      This is a pure conflict of interests.</li></ul><p>However, the change starts
      with each of us. Every time that we say or post in social media something like
      \u201CMy university has advanced N positions in ranking X\u201D, this adds to
      the validity of rankings in the eyes of potential customers. By refraining from
      making such statements, every member of academic community can contribute to
      reducing the harmful impact of rankings.</p><p></p><span class=\"caption\"><strong><br>Competing

      of agricultural research through initiatives like \u2018extension\u2019 programs
      has long been recognized as essential for development. </p><p>These extension
      activities to reach out to small farmers are particularly important in relation
      to improving livelihoods. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/\"
      target=\"_blank\">720-811 million were suffering from hunger</a>\r\nworldwide,
      of which 50% were estimated to be small farmers. This means that improving food
      security requires forms of research transfer and local and indigenous knowledge
      integration that reach out to small farmers, who constitute a particularly vulnerable
      group.</p><p>Public organisations working on agriculture have long been aware
      of the centrality of \u2018extension\u2019 for improving rural livelihoods.
      The reason is that agriculture depends heavily on contexts, and agricultural
      contexts may change dramatically across short geographical distances due to
      variations in climate and soils. The notion of \u2018extension\u2019 research
      gradually shifted from top-down, unidirectional teaching from researchers to
      farmers, toward more mutual learning and co-operation between researchers and
      farmers, so that science can respond to these local needs and contexts. Through
      <a href=\"https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods\"
      target=\"_blank\">participatory and learning approaches</a> can technical and
      local knowledge be combined in order to achieve appropriate technologies.  </p><h3>The
      lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture may lead to use of inappropriate
      technology</h3><p>However, research that is more engaged with users and more
      orientated towards application tends to be associated with lower academic visibility,
      because its publications are often not included in the mainstream bibliographic
      databases.</p><p><a href=\"https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/\" target=\"_blank\">Various
      studies</a> have shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in
      mainstream databases is lower than in the natural sciences, but well above the
      social sciences and the humanities. Yet the situation is much worse in terms
      of the coverage of the Global South in the mainstream databases. For example,
      <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">studies
      by Subbiah Arunachalam</a> in 2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by
      Indian researchers in agricultural research, 78% were in Indian journals and
      77% were not indexed by Web of Science. Other studies have highlighted that
      crops relevant in the Global South also have a much lower coverage in Web of
      Science (WoS), for example <a href=\"http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/\" target=\"_blank\">the
      crop pearl millet</a>.  </p><p><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/\"
      target=\"_blank\">A study on rice research</a> found that coverage of publications
      in mainstream databases was 2 to 3-fold higher for the Global North. Similarly,
      the coverage of topics relevant to the Global North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold
      higher than the topics more relevant in the Global South \u2013 as illustrated
      in Figure 1 for the case of rice research.</p><p>Given that the mission of agricultural
      research institutes and councils is to increase food security, reduce poverty
      and improve natural ecosystems, knowledge communicated through a plurality of
      channels should be valued beyond mainstream international journals. This would
      include, for example, publication formats such as those collected by FAO in
      its <a href=\"https://agris.fao.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AGRIS database</a>\r\n(based
      on national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage of more
      diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison to citation
      index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing databases such as
      CAB Abstracts.</p><p>This lack of visibility has at least two downsides. First,
      universities or research institutes conducting extension programmes or engaged
      agricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing prestigious
      science \u2013 as excellence has increasingly been defined according to publications
      in prestigious journals.  As a result, researchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by \u2018top\u2019 journals, which are mostly focused on topics
      in the Global North.</p><figure class=\"image-full landscape\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\"><figcaption>Figure

      Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and a database with a larger coverage of the

      Global North (such as molecular biology) have a much higher coverage than topics
      relevant to small farmers in the Global South (such as plant characteristics
      or protection). <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/\" target=\"_blank\">Source:

      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic Search Engine Optimization
      for Open Access content, valuable contextual knowledge is harder to discover,
      making it challenging to retrieve or access it. In consequence, technical experts
      in agriculture in the Global South are more likely to apply technologies which
      are inappropriate in their countries. For instance, the crop varieties that
      are available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties for a tropical
      context, and information about the crops may be appropriate for Europe but inappropriate
      in Brazil or India. Including more local agricultural journals in bibliographic
      databases could help promote local agricultural solutions, as researchers and
      practitioners would have access to a wider range of information and perspectives.</p><p><a
      href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3886019\" target=\"_blank\">A
      recent study</a> shows that countries in Africa and Asia suffer a much higher
      loss of productivity in agriculture than countries in Europe and the Americas
      as a consequence of the use of inappropriate technologies, where the degree
      of inappropriateness is estimated as the mismatch in the presence of crop-specific
      pests and pathogens (see Figure 2). This inappropriate use of agricultural technologies
      is partly due to the lower amount of research in topics and areas of interest
      of the Global South, but also partly due to the challenges in locating and accessing
      contextualised knowledge which already exists but is published in local venues
      (journals, reports, policy documents, etc.). </p><figure class=\"image-full

      broader coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A\"
      target=\"_blank\">new publication</a> by the <a href=\"https://pkp.sfu.ca/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Public Knowledge Project</a>\r\ninterestingly challenges the
      perception, created by the conventional use of mainstream databases, that research
      is extremely concentrated in journals and publications of the Global North.
      Analysing 25,671 journals with 5.8 million documents of the platform Open Journal
      System (OJS), they found that 80% of the publications originated in the Global
      South, that 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee for authors nor readers)
      and almost half of them have more than one language.</p><p>The success of the
      OJS infrastructure in making possible access and visibility of knowledge from
      the Global South suggests that it is high time for the development of more comprehensive
      databases. This has been a concern in medical research and social science and
      humanities (SSH), leading to the development of regional specialised databases
      such as <a href=\"https://scielo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scielo</a> (more on
      health) and <a href=\"https://www.redalyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Redalyc</a>\r\n(more
      on SSH). In recent years we have also witnessed the development of more comprehensive
      databases like <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Alex</a>,
      <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a> or <a
      href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lens</a>.</p><p>We have conducted
      a small study using the <a href=\"https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en\" target=\"_blank\">MIAR
      portal of the \u2018Information Matrix for the Analysis of Journals\u2019</a>
      of the University of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal
      coverage of various databases (see detailed <a href=\"https://osf.io/fd9cv\"
      target=\"_blank\">methodology</a>\r\nand <a href=\"https://osf.io/9hdgc\" target=\"_blank\">journal
      data</a>). As shown in Figure 3, from a sample of 1662 journals from any country
      with ISSN related to agriculture, we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest
      coverage with 805 (48%) journals, 562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and
      550 (33%) of Veterinary Sciences. In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts
      and Veterinary Sciences have a better and broader coverage in the Global South
      in relative terms.</p><figure class=\"image-full landscape\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure3.png\"><figcaption>Figure
      3. Coverage of the analysed sample of 1662 agricultural journals by the largest
      database specialised in agriculture, CAB Abstracts, in comparison to WoS and
      Scopus. 46% of the journals are not covered by any of these databases.</figcaption></figure><p>These
      results have to be contrasted with new databases such as <em>Dimensions</em>
      and <em>Open Alex</em> that index papers rather than journals. Here we have
      made some estimations for <em>Dimensions</em>, which showed a coverage of about
      1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was high also in the Global South, with
      46 (41%) of African journals, against a 28 (25%) in CAB Abstracts. Only for
      a few countries, including Iran, Germany, Romania or Cuba, was <em>Dimensions</em>
      coverage lower than <em>CAB Abstracts</em>.<br></p><p>The downside of these
      new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with the Google Scholar Coverage)
      is the lack of inquiry of the publishing practices of journals. We found that
      some of the journals included in the larger databases, but not present in the
      more traditional databases such as CAB Abstracts, have a higher incidence of
      problematic or questionable editorial and review practices (here the term <a
      href=\"https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018predatory\u2019 is unhelpful</a>).</p><h3>Another bibliographic
      coverage is possible, and necessary</h3><p>In conclusion, another bibliographic
      world is possible where knowledge is more diverse and accessible \u2013 and
      this is important for agricultural research to be more visible and accessible
      in and from the Global South. Infrastructures towards this transformation have
      to be developed to enhance interoperability and cooperation. This is the case,
      for example, of the analysis centres that feed the FAO's <a href=\"https://agris.fao.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">AGRIS information system</a>, including grey literature. While
      currently no single commercial bibliographic database has a good coverage of
      agriculture, a new generation of databases in conjunction with metadata aggregators
      from open access repositories may help fill this gap. This increase in diversity
      of journals comes at the cost of having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal
      editorial practices. This challenge could be overcome with catalogues of editorial
      practices such as <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DOAJ</a> or
      <a href=\"https://latindex.org/latindex/\" target=\"_blank\">Latindex</a>\r\nand
      platforms such as <a href=\"https://miar.ub.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIAR</a>.
      </p><p>It is about time to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to
      provide visibility and accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant to many
      more contexts, particularly in the Global South, so that knowledge of appropriate
      technologies can foster human development across all the world. </p><p><strong>Acknowledgement:

      side are scientists on in times of climate breakdown? Science is often called
      upon to provide knowledge and expertise to address global challenges and accelerate
      towards sustainable futures. But, critical times ask for critical thinking on
      science for sustainability.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>European and global science
      policy have been restructured around \u2018global challenges\u2019 and \u2018research
      excellence\u2019 to commit to societal impact. Our current global challenges,
      including climate change, destruction of nature, and increasing global inequality,
      require critical interrogation of the contributions and consequences of science.
      In the process of understanding, resolving, and transforming global challenges
      we should be attentive to what is at the core of science: the attribution of
      value to numerical or qualitative values such as counting, classifying and evaluating
      physical and societal phenomena. This also holds for the practice of governing
      science. Science policy articulates particular kinds of future (e.g. environmental
      or societal outcomes) that are considered either desirable or unattractive,
      and it ascribes particular roles and values to science in the making of these
      futures. This raises important questions about the values attributed to scientific
      expertise and policy making in relation to sustainable futures, and the role
      and agency of science and policy in shaping sustainable futures.</p><p>In an
      attempt to address these questions, we hosted <a href=\"https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/workhop\"
      target=\"_blank\">a two-day workshop on 13 and 14 June 2023</a> as part of the
      <a href=\"https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FluidKnowledge</a>\r\nproject
      of Sarah de Rijcke. We gathered  a variety of academics reflecting on doing
      science in times of climate breakdown. Participants submitted contributions
      that covered different topics including but not limited to biodiversity modelling
      for sustainable financing, sustainable agriculture, deep sea mining and nature
      conservation. The variety of topics provided different angles to reflect upon
      roles and practices at the interface between science policy and scientific expertise,
      and how scientists position themselves in their research. Although many relevant
      concepts were discussed for each contribution, we would like here to highlight
      two common themes: Power and Plurality. Both concepts materialized in various
      forms and contexts and made the bridge between the different contributions.
      The combination of Power and Plurality made us, during the workshop, reflect
      upon our own position as researchers.<br></p><h3>Power, Plurality, and the Position
      of the research(er)</h3><p>We started the workshop with two contributions addressing
      climate and biodiversity modelling. Power materializes in modelling practices
      when modellers navigate the powerfulness of climate and biodiversity scenario
      models in shaping policies and futures. Biodiversity and climate models are
      often developed by scientific institutions to project biodiversity and climate
      patterns. However, their power extends beyond the scientific institutions when
      they are applied to, for example, inform decision-making in sustainable financing
      or global policy-making. In these translation processes from science to environmental
      decision-making the political, social and ethical dimensions come into play.
      The plurality of perspectives present in these dimensions are <em>not</em> integrated
      in the original models. Nevertheless, the models and the knowledge models create
      <em>are</em>\r\nused in high level decision-making and serve therefore as a
      powerful tool that scientific institutions should take into account in their
      model designs. </p><p>When zooming out, we touched upon the powerful organizational
      forms of what is valued as \u2018useful science\u2019, which is now dominated
      by the (Western) techno economic paradigms that steer green technology transitions.
      A good example of the power of this paradigm is the demands it puts on governments,
      companies, and researchers to explore the deep seabed for minerals like cobalt
      to support a sustainable future.  We touched upon deep sea research that seem
      to be trapped into a power grab, controlled by (inter)national governments and
      industry to generate knowledge on the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining
      useful for companies and policy-making at international levels. In relation
      to that, the importance of disinterestedness of researchers in this space is
      highly valued by most actors involved. As a result, this means that eyebrows
      are being raised when researchers cooperate with industry or, alternatively,
      when researchers tend to take radical views against deep sea mining. Is it,
      as scientists, justifiable to step away from the importance of being detached
      and disinterested, and actively choose sides? </p><h3>Whose side are we on?
      </h3><p>\u2018Whose side are we on\u2019 as researchers was vividly highlighted
      when discussing a contribution on the co-creation of knowledge for nature conservation
      in South Africa. The pressure put on scientists to engage with the variety of
      social actors that work in South African nature parks stems from the belief
      that this would increase the effectiveness of implementing conservation policies
      and empower local communities. However, based on experiences with research projects
      on transfrontier wildlife management and private game farming, we discussed
      whether knowledge co-creation can also be counterproductive for empowering marginalized
      communities. This could be the case when powerful actors like non-profit organizations
      or wildlife managers try to silence marginalized communities through discrediting
      researchers and delegitimizing other types of knowledges and perspectives. Instead
      of disengaging, detaching, and staying independent from these power dynamics,
      researchers might have to choose positions when engaging in these types of socio-ecological
      issues. </p><p>By the end of a fruitful and constructive workshop discussion,
      we were left with more questions than answers to reflect upon. The discussions
      and diversity of topics that were addressed in the context of doing science
      in times of climate breakdown led us to reflect on who\u2019s side we are on
      as researchers ourselves. This includes the question of what we can potentially
      do (more of) or should stop doing within our research and beyond to address
      global challenges. What does it actually mean to be a scientist in this world?
      Should we politicize science, take (very) critical views on what is happening,
      stand up from the relatively comfortable science studies armchair and dive in?
      </p><p>What is next? All workshop participants will continue to write their
      own contributions and reflect on these questions in the next year. The current
      contributions will be further developed into a journal collection or edited
      volume. We extend our warm thanks to all participants of the workshop: B\xE9atrice

      comparada al a\xF1o anterior y que ahora se encuentra en el top 5, 10 o 100
      de cierta regi\xF3n. La nueva posici\xF3n es usada como una muestra irrefutable
      de la excelencia de la instituci\xF3n y del esfuerzo de sus empleados. Las preguntas
      que casi nadie hace son \xBFde qu\xE9 manera es la universidad n\xFAmero 30
      mejor que la universidad 31? O, \xBFqu\xE9 tan diferente es la universidad 30
      en comparaci\xF3n con la 29?</p><p>Muchos rankings usan indicadores compuestos,
      esto quiere decir que toman varias medidas como publicaciones cient\xEDficas,
      encuestas de estudiantes, n\xFAmero de subvenciones y premios internacionales
      entre sus graduados; los mezclan de acuerdo a una f\xF3rmula interna y le dan

      criticado por usar indicadores arbitrarios, por equiparar aspectos dif\xEDciles
      de comparar entre s\xED, o por la falta de transparencia en cuanto a los mecanismos
      para asignar valor. Por ejemplo, una universidad que se estableci\xF3 hace m\xE1s
      de 130  a\xF1os tendr\xE1 probablemente m\xE1s ganadores del premio Nobel que

      publicados y usados ampliamente, especialmente por las propias universidades
      y los medios de comunicaci\xF3n. </p><h3>El Leiden Ranking</h3><p>El Leiden
      Ranking no es un listado jer\xE1rquico ni est\xE1tico, sino que provee indicadores
      cubriendo varias dimensiones del desempe\xF1o de 1411 universidades mundiales
      a partir de datos bibliom\xE9tricos, es decir a partir de publicaciones cient\xEDficas.
      Las universidades que se han incluido en la \xFAltima edici\xF3n, 2023, son
      aquellas que tienen un m\xEDnimo de 800 publicaciones contadas de forma fraccional
      e indexadas en la Web of Science (WoS).</p><p>El ranking es publicado por el
      <a href=\"http://www.cwts.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Science and Technologies
      Studies (CWTS)</a> un centro de la Universidad de Leiden en los Pa\xEDses Bajos,
      y se gu\xEDa por <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2q274\" target=\"_blank\">10
      <u>principios</u></a> para el uso responsable de ranking de universidades. </p><figure><img

      data-image=\"34713\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><h3>Perspectiva de listado</h3><p>A
      primera vista, el Leiden Ranking parece un ranking como cualquier otro dado
      que al abrir la p\xE1gina encontramos un listado de universidades ordenado de
      acuerdo a cierto criterio de impacto cient\xEDfico: por defecto el n\xFAmero
      de publicaciones (P) calculadas siguiendo el recuento fraccionario. Sin embargo,
      este no es un ordenamiento jer\xE1rquico est\xE1tico de universidades ya que
      de forma interactiva podemos ordenar el listado bas\xE1ndonos en la dimensi\xF3n
      e indicador que estemos interesados, de entre las diferentes opciones que se
      ofrecen. De hecho, el ranking no es un listado sino una herramienta que permite
      explorar los indicadores desde varias perspectivas. Adem\xE1s, el listado inicial
      que aparece es una de las tres perspectivas que ofrece el sitio para explorar
      diferentes dimensiones e indicadores, las otras dos son por mapa o por gr\xE1fico.

      de gr\xE1fico y en mapa</span></span><h3>Diferentes dimensiones e indicadores</h3><p>A
      diferencia de otros rankings, el Leiden Ranking s\xF3lo provee informaci\xF3n
      sobre los resultados de la investigaci\xF3n cient\xEDfica a partir de publicaciones
      en revistas indexadas por la WoS. Este enfoque nos permite garantizar que los
      datos hayan sido recolectados y enriquecidos con rigor, y que la metodolog\xEDa
      usada para el an\xE1lisis sea transparente. </p><p>Las diferentes dimensiones
      que se pueden explorar son:</p><ul><li>Impacto cient\xEDfico \u2013 basada en
      citas a las publicaciones de una universidad.</li><li>Colaboraci\xF3n \u2013
      basada en la colaboraci\xF3n de una universidad con otras organizaciones y regiones.</li><li>Acceso
      Abierto \u2013 basada en las publicaciones en acceso abierto de diferentes tipos.</li><li>G\xE9nero
      \u2013 basada en el an\xE1lisis de g\xE9nero de los autores de las publicaciones.</li></ul><p>Por
      su parte, cada dimensi\xF3n se puede explorar a trav\xE9s de diferentes indicadores
      como n\xFAmero total o porcentaje de publicaciones, distancias para la colaboraci\xF3n
      y tipos de Acceso Abierto. En la p\xE1gina de <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators\"
      target=\"_blank\">indicadores</a> se encuentra una explicaci\xF3n m\xE1s detallada
      de cada uno de ellos (en ingl\xE9s).</p><p>Adem\xE1s de las dimensiones y sus
      indicadores, el usuario puede crear su propio ranking seleccionando un periodo,
      disciplina, regi\xF3n y n\xFAmero m\xEDnimo de publicaciones. Por \xFAltimo,
      los indicadores de impacto cient\xEDfico se pueden calcular utilizando un m\xE9todo
      de recuento total o fraccionario. El m\xE9todo de recuento completo otorga un
      peso total de 1 a cada publicaci\xF3n de una universidad. El m\xE9todo de recuento
      fraccionado da menos peso a las publicaciones colaborativas que a las no colaborativas.
      </p><p><strong>La Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo y la Universidad Nacional Aut\xF3noma
      de M\xE9xico</strong></p><p>En la edici\xF3n del 2023 encontramos a la Universidad
      de S\xE3o Paulo (USP) y a la Universidad Nacional Aut\xF3noma de M\xE9xico (UNAM),
      entre muchas otras de Am\xE9rica Latina. Al ver la vista est\xE1ndar en el listado
      parece que USP est\xE1 en 86 posiciones m\xE1s arriba que la UNAM. Si nos fijamos
      en las opciones veremos que se trata del periodo 2018-2021, para todas las disciplinas,
      en todo el mundo, con un m\xEDnimo de publicaciones en 100, dimensi\xF3n impacto
      cient\xEDfico, ordenado por n\xFAmero total de publicaciones (recuento fraccionado).
      Si cambiamos las opciones, las posiciones cambiar\xEDan. A continuaci\xF3n,

      es mejor?</h3><p>Entonces, \xBFqu\xE9 universidad es mejor? A partir de los
      datos del Leiden Ranking, <strong>no podemos hacer ese juicio de valor</strong>.
      La mejor manera de usar el ranking es explorando las diferentes dimensiones
      y perspectivas, as\xED como la informaci\xF3n detallada de cada universidad
      en espec\xEDfico. Todo ello sin perder de vista lo que se est\xE1 midiendo:
      el desempe\xF1o de investigaci\xF3n cient\xEDfica a partir de publicaciones
      en una base de datos espec\xEDfica.</p><p>Como se mencion\xF3 anteriormente,
      el Leiden Ranking es una herramienta interactiva que proporciona diferentes
      dimensiones e indicadores, no an\xE1lisis completos. Estos indicadores pueden
      ser utilizados en conjunto con otros indicadores y an\xE1lisis para analizar
      el desempe\xF1o de una instituci\xF3n a partir de estrategias espec\xEDficas.
      </p><p>El Leiden Ranking tiene, entre sus limitaciones, basarse en datos propietarios,
      los cuales no cubren muchos idiomas y que no son de Acceso Abierto. En CWTS
      somos conscientes de estas limitaciones, es por ello que apoyamos <a href=\"https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/\"
      target=\"_blank\">More Than Our Rank</a><strong>,</strong> una iniciativa de
      <a href=\"https://inorms.net\" target=\"_blank\">INORMS</a> (International Network
      of Research Management Societies). La iniciativa busca proveer a instituciones
      acad\xE9micas \u201Cuna oportunidad para destacar las muchas y variadas formas
      en que sirven al mundo, las cuales no est\xE1n reflejadas en posiciones de rankings\u201D.
      Los objetivos de <strong>More Than our Rank </strong>se al\xEDnean perfectamente
      con nuestros principios de uso responsable de rankings. Esperamos que muchas
      universidades y partes interesadas se unan a esta iniciativa tan importante
      y necesaria.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Andrea

      of universities in the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking</a> keeps increasing. Like in the last three editions of the ranking,
      a university needs to have at least 800 fractionally counted publications in
      the most recent four-year time window to be included in the ranking. This year
      1411 universities meet this criterion, 93 more than last year and 235 more than
      in 2020.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pwAOnYIYRXvQ5u5W_TcOi16i3C-5oTgeVJn3BalW694JG9e7ZGrgFyem5Rs0VAB3Q26Fotr_fpy5Q_mg8vwPUW3xztGJokFYSJ1Zz0YZrAbz0kVHCHNatboH6rT7B2dUxUkNSgQ_CY7DeeX3SQkbLIU\"

      (Nazarbayev University).</p><h3><strong>More Than Our Rank</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">At
      CWTS we are strongly committed to promoting responsible uses of university rankings.
      Almost 20 years ago, our former director Ton van Raan was one of the first experts
      expressing concerns about the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6\"
      target=\"_blank\">fatal attraction of rankings of universities</a>. By creating
      the Leiden Ranking and contributing to <a href=\"https://www.umultirank.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">U-Multirank</a>, we have introduced alternatives to simplistic
      one-dimensional rankings. We have also developed <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse\"
      target=\"_blank\">ten principles</a> to guide the responsible use of university
      rankings.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Building on this longstanding commitment to responsible
      uses of university rankings, we are proud to be one of the initial supporters
      of <a href=\"https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/\" target=\"_blank\">More
      Than Our Rank</a>, an initiative launched in October 2022 by the International
      Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS). By providing \u201Can opportunity
      for academic institutions to highlight the many and various ways they serve
      the world that are not reflected in their ranking position\u201D, More Than
      Our Rank  is fully aligned with our principles for ranking universities responsibly
      (see Figure 3). We hope that many universities and other stakeholders will join
      this important initiative.</p><figure style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/u8y6uGPEPZ6jxaoHijGPDnUBIrkc_cKzLTofrjETqHH3Xr2irg6Fwiy1LFGEJojuGx4RouZrz-il3et2-erVqMJVzr3Uo7vrhgIjguB9FhyXhBQECbVZvMOqNrmE5gFWRMMjI57JHcNvFjRi\"

      the Leiden Ranking more transparent</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Being as transparent
      as possible is one of <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse\"
      target=\"_blank\">our principles for responsible university ranking</a>. While
      the Leiden Ranking offers methodological transparency by <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/general\"
      target=\"_blank\">documenting its methods</a> in considerable detail, the <a
      href=\"https://clarivate.com/products/webofscience/\" target=\"_blank\">Web
      of Science data</a> on which the ranking is based (made available to us by Clarivate,
      the owner of Web of Science) is of a proprietary nature and cannot be shared
      openly. This limits the <a href=\"https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">transparency and reproducibility</a> of the Leiden Ranking.
      It is also in tension with the growing recognition of the importance of \u201Cindependence
      and transparency of the data, infrastructure and criteria necessary for research
      assessment and for determining research impacts\u201D (one of the principles
      of the <a href=\"https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment</a>).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">new strategic plan of CWTS</a>, openness of research information
      is a top priority. Open data sources such as <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>
      offer exciting opportunities to produce bibliometric analytics in a fully transparent
      and reproducible way. We are currently working on an ambitious project in which
      we explore the use of open data sources to create a fully transparent and reproducible
      version of the Leiden Ranking. We expect to share the outcomes of this project
      later this year.</p><h3><strong>Let us know your feedback and ideas</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">As always, we appreciate your feedback on the Leiden Ranking and
      your ideas on ways to improve the ranking. Don\u2019t hesitate to <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/contact\"

      academic publishing that is fast, transparent, and free. Is that a pipe dream
      or something within reach? We already have preprint publishing (fast), open
      peer review (transparent), and diamond/overlay journals (free). If we could
      connect these disparate initiatives, would that make our dream come true? And
      how could this best be done? These are questions that are currently being discussed
      by us and others at Leiden University.  </p><p>While we are proud that Leiden
      is the Dutch champion when it comes to preprint publishing, we realize that
      we cannot make this journey alone. Colleagues at other Dutch universities also
      bring invaluable expertise. Wageningen University, for instance, is the leading
      Dutch university in terms of its contribution to Peer Community In, and Radboud
      University is at the forefront of the national Openjournals initiative (<em>the
      assertions in this paragraph are based on some elementary observations. See
      </em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7961825\" aria-label=\"Link attachment\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a>). Open Science Communities are found in
      every Dutch university, and these communities play a crucial role in discussing
      new recognition and reward systems in relation to open science. </p><p>For researchers,
      this plethora of new publishing options is a <em>mer \xE0 boire</em>. Where
      to start? What to do next? Is it safe? What does my funder or manager require?
      In the meantime, the classical publishers offer one-stop shopping: simply submit
      your article to our journal and we will take care of the rest. That this route
      is neither fast, transparent nor cheap is then often accepted, though reluctantly.
      \ </p><p>But what if some Dutch universities would combine their efforts? We
      might create a publishing avenue, from preprint publishing to open peer review
      to dissemination via a diamond or overlay journal, facilitating further dialogue
      and revised versions. Persistent identifiers are the signposts along this road.
      Funders could recognize everyone\u2019s contribution in this process, from author
      to peer reviewer to publisher. It would make predatory publishing impracticable
      and seriously hinder paper mills.  </p><p>If this perspective inspires you,

      \                                               <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\">previous
      blog post</a> we introduced the CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028. Building on
      this, in the current post we present the new focal areas in which CWTS organizes
      its activities. These focal areas address key challenges in the way science
      is practiced and governed, in particular challenges for which we believe our
      centre is uniquely positioned to make a difference and to contribute to transformative
      changes.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-focal-areas-of-CWTS.png\"
      data-image=\"34092\" alt=\"The focal areas of CWTS\"></figure><h3>Focal areas</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Most of our activities at CWTS take place in three focal areas:
      Engagement & Inclusion, Evaluation & Culture, and Information & Openness. These
      focal areas were launched on January 1, 2023, replacing the three research groups
      in which CWTS was organized until the end of 2022. While the research groups
      represented disciplinary traditions in science studies research, the focal areas
      are organized around key challenges faced by the research system. This reflects
      a major shift in our way of working at CWTS.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each focal area
      consists of a core group of about eight to ten senior staff members and a broader
      group of PhD candidates and other early-career staff members as well as visiting
      researchers. A focal area has a small coordinating team that includes both senior
      researchers and a colleague with expertise in project coordination. To benefit
      from synergies between the focal areas, several staff members are contributing
      to two areas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The box below summarizes the topics addressed
      by the focal areas. While each focal area covers a distinct set of problems,
      the areas are also closely interconnected. The selection of the topics addressed
      by the focal areas is the outcome of an intensive consultative process involving
      the entire CWTS team. By focusing on these topics, we aim to set clear priorities
      and to maximize the impact of our work. The importance of setting priorities
      was emphasized in the evaluation of our centre that took place last year. In
      its advice, the evaluation committee also identified topics that it felt may
      deserve more attention in the work of our centre. The suggestions made by the
      committee have proven very useful in defining the focal areas.<br></p><div style=\"background-color:
      #f3f3f3; padding:10px;\"><h4 style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\">Engagement
      & Inclusion</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The focal area <em>Engagement & Inclusion</em>
      aims to contribute to a more collaborative, engaged, and inclusive research
      system. We believe in promoting diversity and inclusion in the global scientific
      workforce, and in recognizing the essential role that communication and co-creation
      of scholarly activities play in strengthening such a diverse system. The focal
      area approaches these questions through strategic ambitions around the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda: <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening</em>,
      and <em>practicing</em>. Examples of such ambitions include improving our understanding
      of the role of epistemic diversity in knowledge creation, developing policy
      recommendations for more inclusive and diverse academic careers, and taking
      more proactive measures to co-create our own activities with a larger variety
      of societal stakeholders (e.g., NGOs, educational organizations, and citizens).</p><h4
      style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\">Evaluation & Culture</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      focal area <em>Evaluation & Culture</em> is concerned with the many different
      ways in which research is evaluated, for instance through assessment of research
      institutions and individual researchers, and through peer review in publishing
      and funding contexts. Recognizing the mutual shaping of research and research
      evaluation, we are committed to promoting forms of evaluation that are suited
      to diverse knowledge making practices and that foster healthy and inclusive
      academic working environments. The focal area combines activities in the <em>understanding</em>,
      <em>intervening</em>, and <em>practicing</em> pillars of the CWTS knowledge
      agenda. We want to better understand how research evaluation in its many forms
      conditions research agendas, notions of quality, and daily practices of research
      and scholarly communication. In addition, we aim to use our insights to promote
      positive change, for example by advising institutions like universities and
      funding bodies on how to organize evaluation for epistemic and social inclusivity,
      diversity, and openness. Lastly, we aim to practice our values by constantly
      reflecting on how we do evaluation in our immediate working environment.</p><h4
      style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\">Information & Openness</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      focal area <em>Information & Openness</em> is concerned with studying and advancing
      openness of research information, such as information about the activities and
      outputs of researchers and research institutions. We believe that openness of
      research information can play an important role in fostering responsible research
      assessment practices and promoting global inclusiveness in science. The activities
      of the focal area revolve around the <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening</em>,
      and <em>practicing</em> pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We aim to develop
      a deep understanding of the open research information landscape and to monitor
      the openness of research information. We also intend to develop initiatives
      that promote openness of research information as the norm for scientometric
      analyses. In addition, we are putting the use of open research information into
      practice in our own work. The work of CWTS will increasingly be based on open
      rather than closed research information, making our work more transparent, reproducible,
      and inclusive.</p></div><h3>Strategic ambitions</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The focal
      areas are currently developing strategic ambitions for the period 2023-2028.
      Each focal area organizes its strategic ambitions in three pillars:</p><ul><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Understanding:</em></strong> Ambitions
      that focus on developing a deeper understanding of the problems addressed in
      the focal area.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Intervening:</em></strong>
      Ambitions that contribute to improving the research system, for instance through
      Horizon Europe projects, products and services of <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS BV</a>, and also through training, advocacy, and contributions
      to policy making.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Practicing:</em></strong>
      Ambitions that contribute to improving our own way of working at CWTS (\u2018practice
      what we preach\u2019).</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">While a research centre may
      traditionally be expected to focus primarily on <em>understanding</em>, for
      our centre&nbsp;<em>intervening</em> is of equal importance. As discussed in
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\">our
      previous blog post</a>, the mission of CWTS is to improve how science is practiced
      and governed and how it serves society. Realizing this mission requires us to
      invest our efforts both in <em>understanding</em> and in <em>intervening</em>.
      In addition, recognizing that we are part of the research system ourselves,
      we also feel a special responsibility to improve our own way of working by <em>practicing</em>
      what we preach, for instance in areas such as <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/practicing-what-we-preach-our-journey-toward-open-science\">open
      science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts\">recognition
      and rewards</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At the moment the focal areas are working
      hard to finalize the development of their strategic ambitions in the <em>understanding</em>,
      <em>intervening</em>, and <em>practicing</em> pillars. They expect to announce
      their plans in the coming months.<br></p><h3>Next steps</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      focal areas, along with new ambitions in the <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening</em>,
      and <em>practicing</em> pillars, represent a major change in our way of working
      at CWTS. The full implementation of these key elements in the CWTS knowledge
      agenda 2023-2028 will take time. We therefore see 2023 and 2024 as a transition
      period in which the knowledge agenda will be further elaborated and fine-tuned
      and in which the introduction of a new way of working at our centre will be
      completed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We expect that the Leiden Madtrics blog will be
      used to provide further updates on the development of the knowledge agenda and
      the focal areas. Keep an eye on future blog posts!</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We
      thank the focal area coordinators for preparing the brief descriptions of the
      focal areas presented in this blog post.</em><br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Sarah

      January 1, 2023 CWTS launched its new knowledge agenda, a strategic plan for
      the centre for the period 2023-2028. In this post the directors of CWTS introduce
      the new knowledge agenda.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">Academic research
      has become increasingly complex, multidisciplinary, collaborative, and transnational.
      The institutions that underpin research - including communication and evaluation
      systems - are trying to keep up, with varying levels of success. At the same
      time, our society is facing major challenges, including existential global health,
      welfare, and sustainability issues. Obtaining solid evidence-informed solutions
      to address these challenges requires a research system that encourages collaboration
      between researchers and with societal stakeholders, that values intellectual
      curiosity, outside-the-box thinking, and a diversity of perspectives, and that
      stimulates open sharing of results. It also requires a research system that
      reflects on its own role in society and its own shortcomings. This is the research
      system that we, at CWTS, want to help create.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming
      six years, CWTS will operate under the heading of a new high-level strategic
      plan. In this blog post we share the purpose and mission of this new knowledge
      agenda. Our knowledge agenda replaces the research program <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2q2x2.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Valuing Science and Scholarship</em></a> that we have
      been working on between 2017 and 2022. <br></p><h3>Not another research program</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it is common for research institutes at Dutch universities
      to have a <em>research program</em>, over the past years we began to feel the
      limits of a framing that prioritizes research and leaves less room for other
      important activities. Instead, we wanted our new strategy to embrace all our
      activities, from our fundamental research to our tool development, and from
      our interventions in policy and education to our consultancy and contract work.
      The term <em>knowledge agenda</em> is intended to communicate this inclusive
      ambition. It describes the mission we will work on, the collective values we
      will uphold, and the strategic topics we will address.<br></p><h3>Mission</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">In the lead-up to this new knowledge agenda, we spent a considerable
      amount of time in 2022 discussing with the entire CWTS team the mission and
      values of our centre. We also organized two retreats that included brainstorming
      sessions with academic partners and other stakeholders and even offered an opportunity
      to <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts\">develop
      dream projects</a>. And finally, we worked on defining focal areas for our institute
      and developed a new organizational structure around these focal areas. We will
      introduce these focal areas in a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\">next
      blog post</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png\"
      data-image=\"33918\" alt=\"Knowledge agenda\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Together,
      we came up with the following mission statement for our centre:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"
      style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"><em>Our mission
      at CWTS is to improve how science is practiced and governed and how it serves
      society</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To realize this mission, we aim to develop a
      deep understanding of the dynamics of scientific knowledge production, based
      on in-depth engagement with a broad range of scientific and societal stakeholders.
      We also aim to contribute to reforms in research assessment, adoption of open
      science practices, changes in research cultures, and innovations in research
      analytics. Moreover, recognizing that we are part of the research system ourselves,
      we strive to practice what we preach and to lead by example.<br></p><h3>Values</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">In our new knowledge agenda, we are trying to adopt a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts\">more
      explicitly value-led framework</a> that aims for congruence between the knowledge
      we create, our own research culture, and our internal governance mechanisms.
      The goal of \u2018practicing what we preach\u2019 is to foster a positive culture
      at our centre, not only stemming from our knowledge about the research system,
      but also born from and carried by the CWTS community. To incorporate a more
      active reflection on our own values into our strategy, we collectively developed
      four core values to guide our work and decision-making:<br></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><em>Transformative.</em> We want to make a difference by inciting
      transformative changes in the way science is practiced and governed and the
      way it serves society.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Evidence-informed.</em>
      We value evidence-informed work and policy-making. We collect scientific evidence
      and act on it, but we also acknowledge its limitations. Scientific evidence
      offers essential insights for improving how science is practiced and governed,
      but these insights are always tentative and dependent on context.</p></li><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Collaborative.</em> We value collaborative work.
      To address the complex challenges faced by science and society, we prefer to
      collaborate rather than compete, both internally within our team and with external
      stakeholders. We cherish a diversity of perspectives and strive for a balanced
      representation and recognition of everyone\u2019s interests and contributions.</p></li><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Responsible.</em> We promote more responsible
      ways of practicing and governing science, for instance by making research processes
      more inclusive, research evaluations more fair, and research analytics more
      transparent. We practice what we preach by making our own way of working more
      responsible.</p></li></ul><h3>The coming years</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The CWTS knowledge
      agenda 2023-2028 is intended to be an encompassing, high-level, and value-led
      strategic plan. It is meant to focus our efforts at a time when pushes for reform
      in research assessment and the increased need for openness in research practices
      provide us with a unique opportunity to contribute to a stronger and healthier
      research system. Among other things, we plan to consider how research evaluation
      in its many forms conditions research agendas, notions of quality, and daily
      practices of research and scholarly communication; how strategic and meaningful
      public engagement can become integral to realizing the value and relevance of
      academic research; how policy recommendations for more inclusive and diverse
      academic careers can be developed; and how structural inequities and lack of
      diversity and inclusion in global science can be better understood and addressed.
      Tackling these and other questions requires joint action by many different stakeholders
      in the research system. With our new knowledge agenda, we hope to meaningfully
      contribute to this in the years to come.<br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Sarah

      scholarly communication is getting more diverse and transparent, there is an

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">The scientific community is moving towards a more transparent way
      of conducting and reporting research. Scientific publications are becoming more
      and more openly accessible but openness should also extend to peer review, preprinting,
      preregistration, data sharing, metadata availability, and related issues.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Research funders and other stakeholders are putting a significant
      effort into promoting open science practices in scholarly communication. But
      there is a lack of high-quality infrastructure that provides information on
      the openness, policies and procedures of scholarly journals and other publication
      outlets. Consequently, it can be challenging to answer questions like: how do
      journals organize quality assurance and peer review? How do journals support
      open access publishing? How do journals or preprint servers support preregistration,
      preprinting, and data sharing? How diverse are the editorial teams of journals?</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">This information can be crucial to multiple stakeholders:<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td

      Observatory project</a> aims to contribute to making available the information
      needed by these stakeholders.<br></p><h3>The current landscape, and its shortcomings</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">There are numerous initiatives and platforms providing some part
      of the puzzle, but information is scattered, incomplete, and difficult to compare.
      For example, tools and databases are available that help researchers understand
      how to make their research openly accessible (DOAJ), whether their work can
      be posted in a repository or on a preprint server (Sherpa Romeo), how to ensure
      compliance with funder requirements (Plan S Journal Checker Tool), and how to
      pick a publication platform that offers particular peer review approaches (Transpose),
      open science practices (TOP factor), or that is considered to have a sufficiently
      high citation impact (Journal Citation Reports).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Given this
      complexity, it seems unrealistic to expect stakeholders to know which tools
      or databases to use to obtain specific information.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As new
      models of publishing such as Publish-Review-Curate, publication as you go, preprint
      review and others emerge, distinct publishing functions like dissemination and
      evaluation are increasingly decoupled. This creates the need for different platforms
      to interact and at least to be aware of each other\u2019s policies and requirements.
      At present, there are minimal standards to enable the systematic interoperability
      of these platforms. At the research output level, standards like <a href=\"https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">DocMaps</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/\"
      target=\"_blank\">COAR Notify</a> protocol are under development. However, to
      empower further innovation in scholarly communication, a shared way to describe
      these different platforms and their possibilities of interaction is required.<br></p><h3>The
      Journal Observatory project: aims and approach</h3><p>To address this challenge,
      our project aims to:<br></p><ol><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">define an extensible,
      machine-readable and traceable way to describe the policies and practices of
      the various platforms involved in disseminating and evaluating scholarly works:
      the <strong>Scholarly Communication Platform Framework<br></strong></p></li><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">demonstrate the value of this new framework by building
      a demonstration prototype called the <strong>Journal Observatory</strong>, a
      resource which combines data on journals and other publication platforms from
      various sources to clarify policy information for authors, reviewers and others.</p></li></ol><h4><strong>1.
      Scholarly Communication Platform Framework</strong></h4><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/\"
      target=\"_blank\">The Scholarly Communication Platform Framework</a> is a new,
      high-level, structured language that enables the exchange of information about
      platforms for scholarly communication. To date, we have focused on enabling
      description of platforms for the dissemination and/or evaluation of research
      articles, such as scientific journals, preprint servers, and peer review platforms.
      However, the Framework can fairly easily be extended in the future to describe
      platforms performing other scholarly communication functions (e.g., archiving
      via platforms like LOCKKS/CLOCKKS or Portico), or to describe dissemination/evaluation
      of other types of scholarly outputs (books, datasets, software, code, methods,
      materials). The detailed inner-workings and rationale of the Framework are described
      in our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7860610\" target=\"_blank\">technical
      report</a>. Documentation and source code can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/\"

      Observatory prototype</strong></h4><p>The Journal Observatory prototype is a
      proof-of-concept demonstrator which integrates journal information from diverse
      open data sources including DOAJ, Sherpa Romeo and others, as well as directly
      from publishers. It shows the power of combining information from these different
      sources to support three primary use-case areas: open access publishing, preprinting
      and peer review procedures. By making this information available, we support
      researchers, publishers, funders and research institutions to make informed
      decisions and monitor compliance. The prototype comes both with interfaces for
      machines and with a user-friendly web interface for humans. There are two interfaces
      for machines: a <a href=\"https://sparql.journalobservatory.org/sparql\" target=\"_blank\">SPARQL
      endpoint</a> and a <a href=\"https://api.journalobservatory.org/\" target=\"_blank\">REST
      API</a>. The web interface for humans is provided by the <a href=\"https://app.journalobservatory.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Journal Observatory Browser</a>. More information about the
      prototype, including documentation and source code, can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.journalobservatory.org/prototype/\"

      steps</strong></h3><p>The Journal Observatory project has achieved much within
      a limited timeframe and with limited resources. We see our project and its outputs
      as the start or continuation, not the end, of a much larger conversation. We
      hope our work will provide a base for a more ambitious long-term agenda, co-shaped
      with the wider scholarly community, and aimed at working toward open and interoperable
      infrastructure for providing systematic and reliable information on scholarly
      journals and other scholarly communication platforms.<br></p><h3><strong>The
      community event</strong></h3><p>To mark the end of the project and to launch
      the project\u2019s results, we organized an <a href=\"https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/\"
      target=\"_blank\">online community event</a> on April 25. During the event,
      we presented our work, including a live demo of the Journal Observatory Browser
      to show how the tool can support users in efficiently finding answers to questions
      like: what journals in my field (e.g. sustainability research) provide options
      for Diamond Open Access publishing? How do the preprinting policies of two journals
      compare? What journals in my field adhere to Open Peer Review, in the sense
      of publishing review reports?<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The demonstration was followed
      by Lucy Ofiesh\u2019s (Director of Finance & Operations at Crossref) talk on
      the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI). Lucy described how these
      principles, developed as a community resource to help guide organizations, can
      support the resilience and sustainability of open infrastructure that serves
      the scholarly communications ecosystem.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The event was concluded
      by a panel discussion in which three of the project\u2019s stakeholder advisory
      board members discussed their perspective on the need and future of interoperable,
      systematically-collected information on scholarly communication platforms. Johan
      Rooryck (Executive Director of cOAlition S), Catriona MacCallum (Director of
      Open Science at Hindawi Publishing) and Gabe Stein (Head of Operations and Product
      at the Knowledge Futures Group) shared their view from the perspective of a
      research agency coalition, publisher and infrastructure provider, respectively.
      They agreed that there is a dire need for the kind of service provided by initiatives
      like the Journal Observatory project, but also identified several challenges
      on the road towards sustainability of such initiatives. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The

      between industry and research institutions are a common phenomenon in science.
      But what does the situation look like in Latin America and the Caribbean? In

      as less prominent research areas.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p><a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Triple-Helix-UniversityIndustryGovernment-Innovation-and-Entrepreneurship/Etzkowitz-Zhou/p/book/9781138659490\"
      target=\"_blank\">Industry-University partnership</a> is now part of the governance
      canon of higher education. However, the multiple forms this type of partnership
      can adopt are not so clear for every junior-faculty, administrators, and from
      there to the top-management in the higher education sector. In addition, the
      landscape of Industry-University partnerships can get fuzzy \u2014 not to mention
      difficult \u2014 given the <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en/report-series\"
      target=\"_blank\">scarce resources dedicated to research and development in
      middle and low-income countries</a>. </p><p>Take Latin America and the Caribbean
      as an example. There are no Latin-American companies listed in <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/top-100-innovators/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Clarivate's Top-100 Global Innovators</a>. In addition, as
      of 2022 there are only two companies ranked in the <a href=\"https://www.scimagoir.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">SCImago Institutions Ranking</a>, which assesses institutions
      worldwide in terms of research performance, innovation output, and societal
      impact. Those companies were Petrobras and Estacio Participacoes AS. Petrobras
      is one of the largest companies in the petroleum industry in the region, while
      Estacio Participacoes focuses on private educational services in Brazil. </p><p>Given
      the absence of Latin-American private organizations in the global innovation
      sphere, it is both relevant and urgent to identify highly strategic research
      fields in regions with restricted financial resources and underdeveloped industry
      ecosystems. For instance, in 2019 the average <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=XJ\"
      target=\"_blank\">research and development expenditure in the region was a mere
      0.7%</a>. Also, it is of high value to map research fields still-to-be-explored-and-exploited
      via Industry-University partnerships. </p><h3>Mapping the research-fronts of
      industry in Latin America and the Caribbean</h3><p>In a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221131796\"
      target=\"_blank\">study published in the Journal of Information Science</a>,
      I identified highly strategic research-fronts for both industry and research
      intensive institutions, universities among them, in Latin America and the Caribbean.
      I applied a technique used to establish interconnections and clustering between
      knowledge domains. This technique is called <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.5090140103\"
      target=\"_blank\">bibliographic coupling</a>. </p><p>The bibliographic coupling
      approach enables us to examine the underlying structure of the knowledge required
      for researchers to produce new knowledge. This technique is quite versatile.
      It can process highly multidisciplinary amounts of research documents, such
      as research on the <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/lp/navigating-the-structure-of-research-on-sustainable-development-goals-2/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03308-7\"
      target=\"_blank\">complete set of articles published in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>
      in 150 years of history.</p><p>The approach for coupling two documents is straightforward.
      See the figure below this paragraph. Let's suppose that I'm writing an article
      on biotechnology (A, in Figure 1), and you, the reader, are writing an article
      on bioeconomy (B, in Figure 1). We do not know each other. However, we found
      an interesting article or any other type of scholarly communication such as
      a book chapter, policy paper, and the like, on <em>the</em><em>bioeconomy of
      biotech </em>(C, in Figure 1). Now, we read and assess that scholarly communication,
      and decide to include it in our own study. We cite it and by that common citation
      our documents are now connected. The same applies to the fields of research
      of publication A and B: Because of A and B being connected, biotechnology and
      bioeconomy now share a link as well. <br></p><p>In this first step, the bibliographic
      coupling detects the shared references between research articles to interconnect
      them. Then, in a second step, it is also feasible to interconnect the research
      field of the journals in which those articles were published, thereby assembling
      a network of research fields based on the research articles coupled. <br></p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/bibliographic_coupling_II.png\"
      alt=\"Bibliographic coupling II\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Bibliographic coupling.</figcaption></figure><p>I
      applied this process to a sample of 13,000+ research articles indexed in the
      bibliographic database <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus\"
      target=\"_blank\">Scopus</a>. The articles sourced had to be coauthored by at
      least one author affiliated with an institution in Latin America and the Caribbean
      \u2014 either public or private \u2014, and the same author or another coauthor
      affiliated with a private organization in any other country. </p><p>As I previously
      mentioned, the bibliographic coupling enables us to interconnect the research
      articles produced with industry collaboration and the underlying structure of
      the knowledge required for their development. Once these articles and the academic
      journals in which they were published were identified, I use the research fields'
      classification of the journals to assemble a research field network as follows.
      </p><p>Each academic journal indexed in Scopus receives a classification to
      a single or multiple research field based on the <a href=\"https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/\"
      target=\"_blank\">All Science Journal Classification</a> system. There are over
      330 research fields, categorized into five areas, namely physical sciences,
      life sciences, health sciences, social sciences & humanities, and multidisciplinary.
      In consequence, if two articles connected via bibliographic coupling were published
      in a journal with two classifications such as biotechnology and bioengineering,
      and a second journal with a single classification in molecular medicine, the
      research field network based on these two journals is composed by three interconnected
      fields: biotechnology, bioengineering, and molecular medicine. </p><p>Also,
      I calculated betweenness centrality, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01222-2\"
      target=\"_blank\">an indicator</a> for each research field that unveils its
      strategic position within the network. Figure 2 shows the network layout with
      the research-fields with high strategic position, proportional to the size of
      the nodes. Also, it shows the time of the first publication of a given research-field.
      <br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/research-fronts_III_880_2023-04-12-100133_cbwp.png\"

      Note: nodes proportional to their betweenness centrality score. Based on Juli\xE1n
      D. Cort\xE9s (2023), &quot;Industry-research fronts \u2013 Private sector collaboration
      with research institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean&quot;.</figcaption></figure><h3>Physical
      science, the most active. Multidisciplinary, the most strategic<br></h3><p>Results
      showed that multiple research-fields from different research areas were active
      in industry-research collaborations (further on called industry research fronts).
      Physical science had the most active role. The least active role went to social
      sciences and humanities.</p><p>The research area of physical science with fields
      such as computer science applications, information systems, electrical & electronic
      engineering, energy engineering and power technology took about ~38% of the
      total nodes of the network. Health sciences made up 23% of the nodes. In this
      area, we can find research-fields such as public health, environmental and occupational
      health, or general medicine. For the case of life sciences, an area with ~19%
      of the nodes, we can find research-fields such as genetics, pharmacology, or
      agronomy and crop science. Finally, for social sciences and humanities, with
      ~18% of the fields, we can find fields such as strategy and management, geography,
      planning and development, or economics and econometrics. </p><p>Despite having
      just one node in the network, the area of multidisciplinary research had the
      highest betweenness centrality. Multidisciplinary research was mostly published
      in scientific journals such as <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information\"
      target=\"_blank\">PLoS ONE</a>. According to this journal, they accept: \"<a
      href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information\" target=\"_blank\">over
      two hundred subject areas across science, engineering, medicine, and the related
      social sciences and humanities</a>.\" Therefore, it is quite difficult to dimension
      multidisciplinary research as a single research front, despite its highly strategic
      position in the research fronts network. More so, to outline specific recommendations
      and a plausible course of action to follow through the Industry-University partnership.&nbsp;</p><h3>Uncharted
      research-fronts</h3><p>Through recognizing research fronts, I could determine
      which research-fields had yet to be explored or exploited by industry-institutions.
      Most of these research-fields were from health sciences, such as emergency medicine,
      care planning, or optometry, followed by fields in the social sciences and humanities,
      such demography or life-span and life-course studies. </p><p>Here lie plausible
      interconnections between the aforementioned uncharted fields. For instance,<a
      href=\"https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/\"
      target=\"_blank\">\r\nthe number of US citizens aged over 65 is projected to
      double by 2060</a>. Is it a tangible research front plausibly formed by care
      planning and demography? Is it a potential research front for industry-research
      institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean?</p><p>What I have discussed
      here could be of great use to industry and research institutions. As a first
      insight, both parties can identify mature and emergent research fronts and assess
      how strategic their research capacities are amid the bibliographic network structure.
      Second, they can identify research fields clustered nearby and gauge how likely
      or attractive it might be to delve into different fields. Finally, parties can
      see more clearly which research fields are still unexplored by joint efforts
      between research institutions and industry. Further studies could also source
      other types of research institutions and industry knowledge outputs such as
      patents and patent-citation data to expand industry and research institution
      endeavors.<br></p><p><span class=\"caption\"><br>Header image:&nbsp;Laurel and

      2022, CWTS held a series of open science seminars together with the Research
      Councils of The Netherlands (NWO) and Norway (RCN). Now, all resources from
      the seminars are available on a new Open Science Knowledge Platform. This blogpost
      reflects on building this platform and next steps to come.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Open
      science has gained significant momentum over the past few years, with various
      movements and initiatives emerging to promote sharing of scientific knowledge,
      data, and resources with the wider community. Open science is a broad term encompassing
      a range of practices that strive to increase transparency, inclusivity, and
      accessibility in science. The expected benefits of open science are manifold,
      from accelerating scientific progress, enhancing scientific rigour, promoting
      responsible research, and ensuring public trust in science.</p><p>With that
      in mind, the research councils of the Netherlands (NWO) and Norway (RCN) joined
      hands with CWTS to organize a seminar series on open science throughout 2022.
      The seminars aimed to enrich and expand the understanding of open science within
      the agencies, focusing on programme and policy officers and connected professionals
      interested in the subject. </p><p>Aware of the challenges to reaching all those
      interested within NWO and RCN, we decided to create a knowledge platform to
      store and share the content from the seminars so they could be attended asynchronously.
      Moreover, recognizing the value of the produced content to a broader audience,
      we decided to put the idea of openness into practice, making the platform open
      to the public.</p><h3><a href=\"https://open-science.cwts.nl/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The
      knowledge platform</strong></a></h3><p>The knowledge platform features videos
      from the seminar series presentations, including lectures from Thed van Leeuwen,
      Ludo Waltman, Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner, and myself. Open science champions, as
      we call the many experts that shared experiences and their perspectives with
      our audience, are also there. Additionally, the platform includes support materials,
      access to the slides used in our presentations, links to relevant resources
      and literature, and more.</p><p>The seminar series consisted of four individual
      seminars, included as different sections in the platform. Each one of them covered
      specific aspects of open science:</p><h4><a href=\"https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/introduction-to-os-five-schools-of-open-science\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Introduction to open science</em></a></h4><p>The first
      seminar provided an overview of the complexity of open science as more of an
      umbrella term than a well-defined concept. From that perspective, open science
      refers to a series of movements to remove barriers to sharing any scientific
      output, resources, methods, or tools and bringing scientific results closer
      to the general public. Through a series of examples, we adopted the model of
      five schools of thought proposed by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2\"
      target=\"_blank\">Fecher and Friesike</a> (2014) to understand open science
      in its multiple dimensions, from being democratic to its role in recognition
      and rewards.</p><h4><em><a href=\"https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-scholarly-communication\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open scholarly communication</a></em></h4><p>The second seminar
      delved into open scholarly communication. It covered topics such as open access
      publishing, article processing charges (APCs), Plan S, pre-printing, and open
      peer review. The seminar also covered newer forms of scholarly publishing, with
      diverse levels of openness, and the transition towards a more democratic future
      in science.</p><h4><a href=\"https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-data-software-and-infrastructures\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Open data, software and infrastructures </em></a></h4><p>The
      third seminar focused on aspects connected to the infrastructure school of open
      science, including open data, how to make data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
      and Reusable), and data management plans, as well as recent developments in
      the sharing of code and software. The seminar also covered necessary infrastructures
      for open science, such as repositories.</p><h4><a href=\"https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/recognition-and-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Recognition & rewards and responsible research assessment
      </em></a></h4><p>The fourth seminar approached an important ongoing development
      in the academic world, connecting openness to issues related to recognition
      & rewards and responsible research assessment. The seminar covered the current
      state of those issues and the challenges that arise from them. It also discussed
      responsible research assessment, the development of national matrixes for career
      assessment, the movement towards adopting narrative CVs, and the importance
      of transparency and reproducibility in open science.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>To
      call something a knowledge platform is undoubtedly ambitious. Our four open
      science seminars were designed to introduce fundamental concepts and to put
      these in the context of ongoing policy initiatives. We recognize there is still
      much more to explore, so we built the platform to be updated and expanded. In
      this way, new topics can be added to follow the development of open science
      and enrich the platform's content.</p><p>For instance, at CWTS, we already plan
      to delve into topics such as the open science pillars proposed by the <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a> and the convergence
      of open science and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). We are also interested,
      for instance, in learning from the Global South's efforts in the diamond open
      access model over the past two decades.</p><p>We also welcome contributions
      from new open science champions, as the platform is open to growth and development.
      If you would like to be part of this effort, please reach out <a href=\"mailto:a.l.brasil@cwts.leidenuniv.nl\"
      target=\"_blank\">to me</a>. Launching the open science knowledge platform is
      a first step to something bigger, to a dynamic resource that evolves, reflecting
      the constantly changing nature of open science.</p><h3><strong>Reflections on
      a co-creation process</strong></h3><p>The journey to prepare our seminar series
      and organize the contents into a knowledge platform has been quite interesting
      and rewarding. While we had the chance to debate the state of the art of open
      science within CWTS, we had to build a practical program that could be valuable
      to those working with the topic at different levels, including funding, evaluation,
      and policy design. That was a mission accomplished by adopting a co-creation
      perspective with our partners at NWO and RCN. So, we very much like to thank
      Maria Cruz, Anthony Gadsdon, Marte Qvenild, and Christian Lund not only for
      fruitful discussions around the program and the outcomes, but also for an active
      partnership in every seminar. </p><p>Furthermore, it\u2019s also quite important
      for us to thank our champions. Early in the design of the seminar series, we
      decided to invite additional experts to contribute with their own ideas, perspectives,
      and experiences on open science. The nine champions that joined us have expanded
      our own understanding on open science and helped us create a much more comprehensive
      seminars than we would be able to do alone. So, we also extend our thanks to
      Sonja Grossberndt, Sanli Faez, John Arne R\xF8ttingen, Anne Scheel, Anna van\u2019t

      CVs allow researchers to offer contextual accounts of their career. Ideally,
      they bring about more inclusive forms of research evaluation. In this collective
      blog post, we report on a 5-day workshop organized to reflect on narrative CVs
      and the many questions and opportunities they raise.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Most researchers will only
      think of their Curriculum Vitae (CV) when an application deadline is nearing.
      Yet a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00928-4\" target=\"_blank\">recent
      wave of initiatives to introduce so-called narrative CV formats</a> by research
      funding bodies and universities across Europe have created debate about the
      affordances of an otherwise taken-for-granted bureaucratic genre. Narrative
      CVs are meant to tackle a widely perceived problem in relation to the use of
      traditional CV formats in research evaluation, namely an <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484596v1.full.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">overemphasis on publication- and funding-centric quality criteria</a>,
      and indicators such as the h-index, lifetime citation counts, or journal impact
      factors. There are <a href=\"https://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/9104/9995\"
      target=\"_blank\">concerns</a> that such information is used to reduce complex
      comparative assessments in peer review to simple quantitative tallying, and
      many fear that this will <a href=\"https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/117033/\"
      target=\"_blank\">undermine true innovation and openness of academic career
      systems</a>. When recognition and reward are too narrowly conceived and based
      on quantitative tallying, broad swathes of academic workers end up feeling undervalued
      or not able to play to their strengths, which in turn means waste of talent,
      a less robust/diverse academic system, and persistent inequalities and hierarchies.<br></p><figure

      CVs instead supplement traditional types of biographical information with narrative
      elements through which researchers can tell more contextual stories about their
      background/ career/ career motivation. Ideally, narrative CVs can help diversify
      criteria of success and achievement in research, thereby also diversifying the
      scientific workforce and creating more openness for \u201Cirregular\u201D career
      trajectories.</p><p>Against the backdrop of these debates, we organized <a href=\"https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/curricula-vitae-as-reproductive-interfaces-in-research.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">a 5-day workshop at the Lorentz Center in Leiden</a> in December
      2022 to bring together different academic stakeholders (including researchers,
      funders, policy makers, and administrators) to reflect on these and other new
      developments in CV territory. In this post we share some of our main insights.
      Urgent short-term goals include the need for getting a better sense of the extent
      to which narrative CVs can be effective in addressing the above-mentioned issues,
      and which practical conditions must be met for them to achieve their potential.
      In the medium- to long run, we should ensure that current narrative CV formats
      are part of a coordinated broader strategy to foster inclusive practices in
      research evaluation.</p><h3>Historical convergence vs a new diversity of CV
      formats</h3><p>Narrative CV formats can be seen as merely the latest development
      in the evolution of the genre. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvab040/6500313\"
      target=\"_blank\">Research on the morphology of CVs</a> has for example shown
      that in the humanities in Germany, a narrative format has been gradually replaced
      by a tabular format during the second half of the 20th century. More research
      would be needed to substantiate how representative these findings are for CV
      practices in other fields and countries. Yet overall, we can safely assume that
      CV formats have tended to converge in recent decades, following a relatively
      universal structure based on a range of categories of achievements.</p><p>The
      standardization of formats is in many ways productive. For example, it has made
      it possible to create overarching digital infrastructures for creating and handling
      CVs that can also then be reused for specific application purposes. During the
      workshop, we organized an open source data mining session that drew on the ORCID
      database, which contains a wealth of biographical profiles by researchers that
      can be used to interrogate empirical questions about <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjck6/\"
      target=\"_blank\">academic career systems and academic dynamics</a>. At the
      same time, it is exactly the uniformity of CV formats that current narrative
      CV initiatives and other critical observers of research evaluation systems take
      issue with, since it exerts a form of normalizing power on researchers that
      ultimately urges them to develop their careers around a rather narrow range
      of categories of achievement.<br></p><figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\"><img

      CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption></figure><p>The narrative CV templates
      recently introduced by funders and universities in turn are characterized by
      a diversity in structure and format. At the workshop, we took a particularly
      close look at CV formats used by organizations who were also represented at
      our event, which included the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR), the Swiss
      National Science Fund (SNSF), and the Research Council of the Netherlands (NWO).
      The formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and Dutch research councils all ask for
      some narrative of the trajectory and scientific accomplishments of a researcher.
      The Swiss format requires up to three shorter narratives, while the Luxembourg
      CV requires applicants to submit a personal statement and a personal profile.
      The format used by the Dutch research council in turn is tailored to different
      career stages, with applicants for more advanced funding programs being asked
      to include an account of their leadership expertise in the narrative. Even the
      very term narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon. Rather than creating a sharp
      distinction between narrative and non-narrative, most organizations adopting
      such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines more traditional list-based
      information with narrative elements. One could also argue that interpreting
      any kind of CV format<a href=\"https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024\"></a><a
      href=\"https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024\" target=\"_blank\">always
      requires an effort at narrativization</a>, so as to translate a list of achievements
      into a trajectory that makes sense to human evaluators. These points, as well
      as the current variety in novel CV formats, caution us not to think of narrative
      CV formats as a singular new paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless,
      we will in the following present some overarching questions that are pertinent
      to most if not all narrative CV formats.</p><h3>Evaluative use of narrative
      CVs</h3><p>A basic assumption that seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives
      is that changing the way information is presented to reviewers will also change
      evaluation practices such as the issues discussed in review panels. Yet this
      seems a rather strong supposition. If we think of peer review not simply as
      a mechanism for objectively comparing information about applicants but as a
      practice that is learned through socialization in academic communities, then
      we should assume that making use of the affordances of novel CV formats is not
      something that comes overnight. Instead, we should perhaps expect a gradual
      process in which researchers become familiar with the new format and make progressively
      more use of its features. Empirical investigation into this may be useful, e.g.,
      how do panel members actually negotiate and interpret evaluative criteria when
      using narrative CV formats? Do such practices change over time? In the short
      term, detailed empirical studies that compare how review panels shortlist and
      select candidates when presented with narrative and traditional CVs would be
      desirable (see <a href=\"https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> for a pertinent ongoing research project carried
      out at Cambridge University).</p><p>There may also be inadvertent risks in broadening
      the biographical information that is given as input for reviewers. First, it
      may be that sociocultural biases have a higher chance of coming to the fore.
      Imagine a scenario where sharing personal details such as sexual orientation,
      age, ethnic origin or simply particular life choices predispose reviewers for
      or against the author of the CV. Relatedly, reviewers may be inclined to evaluate
      those stories that resemble their own more positively, a phenomenon often studied
      under the name of homophily. Both bias and its specific form of homophily risk
      undermining ongoing attempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia.
      The potential effects of bias and homophily may potentially be mitigated by
      unconscious bias training, or by assuring reviewer panels are sufficiently diverse
      in terms of gender, ethnic origin, nationality and career stages. Again, empirical
      research on these questions would be desirable. Do bias and homophily occur
      less or more often when using narrative CVs? Are reviewers more likely to call
      each other out on bias and is unconscious bias training a suitable answer? Alternatively,
      can panels better deal with biases if they cultivate a practice making implicit
      biases explicit?<br></p><figure style=\"float:left; margin-right:35px;margin-top:8px;\"><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3annemijn2_300x300.jpg\"
      data-image=\"18292\"><figcaption style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; display:block;
      margin-top:12px;\">Visual CV, created by Annemijn Algra.</figcaption></figure><h3>Crafting
      narratives</h3><p>A whole other set of unresolved questions arise even before
      evaluation, namely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During the workshop,
      we adopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself as an academic,
      even experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations in CVs that resulted
      in <a href=\"https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/\" target=\"_blank\">a live exhibition</a>
      hosted by artists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the images in this blog post have been created during that session). While
      narrative CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements, they
      do create the possibility to frame academic work in ways that highlight different
      dimensions of contributions. For example, this potentially allows for focusing
      also on desirable but usually somewhat undervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication and engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in innovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual researchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how individual researchers contribute
      to collaborative work \u2013 for example, by giving space to account for community-building
      work that does not lead to publications and would normally remain invisible.
      At the same time, the practice of crafting a narrative is also related to sociological
      power dynamics, for example to the command of cultural capital, which is unequally
      distributed across researchers in terms of demographic dimensions such as age
      and social origin. Crafting narratives after all requires much more tacit knowledge
      about \"how to present yourself\" than a standardized tabular format. In addition,
      crafting narratives may come easier for some personality types than others.</p><p>The
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how coherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a group work session chaired
      by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a critical look at academic career advice.
      Academic career advice resources often appear to help reproduce rather traditional
      assumptions about what it means to be a successful researcher. One of the takeaways
      was that the cost of conforming to perceived or real career requirements <a
      href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis\"
      target=\"_blank\">can be high</a>, both to building viable livelihoods and to
      health and wellbeing. Many researchers still work under the assumption that
      the goal of doing academic research is to become a professor, while other career
      paths are perceived as a form of failure. In reality, \u201Cirregular\u201D
      trajectories may not just lead to more professional fulfillment on the side
      of the researcher, but may also have unexpected benefits for society (e.g.,
      when academics engage or contribute to industry, social organizations, or government).
      The narrative CV in principle allows for showcasing diverse trajectories through
      academic research, for example in the sense of creating room to document experience
      working in other fields, professions, or experimenting with novel methods.</p><p>A
      final important concern is of course the time required to craft and evaluate
      narratives, which will often be significant. One way of reducing this work is
      to aim for a degree of harmonization of formats across organizations. Led by
      the Royal Society, efforts to achieve this <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/\"
      target=\"_blank\">are already underway</a> in the UK. A related risk is that
      narrative CVs could turn into a new business opportunity for hired consultants,
      specialized in crafting catchy narratives. The attempt to \u201Coptimize\u201D
      narrative CVs for particular funding opportunities through such professional
      support would seem to undermine the intention of using new formats to increase
      the informational value of CVs, and of course it would raise questions about
      who has or does not have access to the necessary resources for such support.
      Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative CV formats, and it may
      be that a critical assessment or change of direction will be required in a few
      years\u2019 time.</p><figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\"
      data-image=\"18292\"><figcaption style=\"margin-top:6px; width:100%; display:block;
      text-align:center;\">Visual CV, created by Bj\xF6rn Hammarfelt.</figcaption></figure><h3>A
      holistic perspective is needed</h3><p>As this reflection on some of the key
      themes that came up during the workshop shows, there are lots of opportunities
      but also uncertainties related to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps most interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates
      reflection on practices of research assessment that are usually taken for granted.
      We might say that experiments with novel CV formats function as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the fundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science funding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of the questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to avoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV
      formats are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in a broader
      set of practices of research assessment. Addressing the foundational problems
      that narrative CV formats are meant to solve will require an empirically and
      conceptually well-understood view of the self-reproduction of the scientific
      career system - both in terms of how researchers plan their careers and present
      themselves strategically for assessment purposes, and in terms of the practical
      functioning of research evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.</p><p><span

      STI 2022 conference held in Granada was my first large face-to-face conference
      since the pandemic. I was privileged to attend physically and reconnect with
      my international peers again. This trip meant a lot to me, but also made me
      reflect again on the new normal of research connection.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>The trip to <a href=\"https://sti2022.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">the 26th International Conference on Science, Technology and
      Innovation Indicators (STI 2022)</a> in Granada, Spain, was my first international
      trip since I had finished <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/how-does-a-lockdown-affect-a-visiting-researcher-some-reflections-during-the-period-of-the-covid-19-lockdown\"
      target=\"_blank\">my one-year research stay in Leiden</a> and come back to Taiwan.
      When I learned that the STI 2022 conference would be held physically, I was
      very excited about returning to Europe and reconnecting with the colleagues
      over there. Due to the Covid-measures in place in Taiwan, it was not certain
      from the beginning that I would actually be able to attend the conference, but
      in the end it all worked out. I was privileged to attend the STI 2022 conference
      and extremely grateful for this opportunity. My trip was relatively short, and
      I did not have much time to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Granada. People might
      wonder if attending the conference for less than a week was worth traveling
      here from a faraway country. I did remember one colleague asking me this question,
      and my answer was, \u201CYes, definitely.\u201D</p><h3>What reconnecting means
      to me</h3><p>It is because I reconnected to the center of the bibliometric community
      again! As a researcher from faraway Asia, I sometimes felt lost because many
      new topics have not yet been discussed at my place. Attending the STI conference
      live again gave me an excellent opportunity to follow the latest trends and
      have face-to-face discussions with my international peers. For instance, I noticed
      more and more studies and discussions about open infrastructures and new databases
      like Overton. The topic of diversity has gained more attention, with bibliometric
      analyses supporting policy-making in this area. Triangulating quantitative and
      qualitative analyses has become more common. Many interesting works related
      to funding policy also allowed me to understand the funding mechanisms in European
      countries better. I could even get in touch with participants who work at funding
      organizations. Not to mention that it was great to know who else is studying
      OA publishing and APCs, which is one of my research interests.</p><p>Moreover,
      I made some personal \u201Cbreakthroughs\u201D. For instance, it was my first
      time hosting an STI conference session, my first presentation on international
      collaboration, and my first time being part of the reviewers. I have learned
      a lot from preparation to presentation, which gave me more confidence.</p><p>Besides
      that, I also attended the first-ever \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Women_SciPolicy\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Women in Science Policy (WISP)</em></a>\u201D event at
      the conference. This was organized by Gemma Derrick, Cassidy R. Sugimoto and
      Caroline Wagner,&nbsp;who attempted to advocate for acknowledging women in science
      policy to relevant stakeholders and to build up the network for female researchers
      to coordinate matches between mentors and mentees. All female participants from
      different career stages were invited to attend this event on the first day after
      the reception cocktail. The senior female researchers were genuinely willing
      to share their experiences. When they heard questions from the junior researchers,
      they even would introduce other senior researchers who had similar backgrounds
      or had encountered similar issues before to juniors. For me, I did get to know
      more female researchers during the WISP event. It was a more relaxed environment
      than the coffee breaks during the daytime. The atmosphere, in general, was great.
      It did create a safe and friendly space without any burden. Usually, during
      coffee breaks, people update each other on research progress and career status,
      discuss their thoughts on the last session or plenary meeting, or introduce
      and exchange contact information in a hurry. At the WISP, I felt more comfortable
      asking questions and seeking advice like career planning. </p><p>Of course,
      some of these observations and experiences could also have been achieved via
      online conferences, but the live and immediate discussions with international
      peers is the most valuable thing. It is something that is hardly replaced by
      virtual conferences. Real-time and physical conferences provide opportunities
      for connecting. We can interact through more frequent social events like coffee
      breaks, lunches, and dinners. It also gives us a more flexible schedule for
      \u201Cpre and post-conference activity\u201D to enhance the connection. Grasping
      the opportunity to explore the city on the day before the conference starts
      or extending the happy-hour time after the conference ends is a way to get to
      know our colleagues better.</p><h3>Hybrid conferences \u2013 a compromise? </h3><p>Even
      though online conference formats may hardly replace the real and live interactions
      during physical conferences, attending international conferences has its economic
      and environmental costs and may not always be possible or desired. Here is where
      hybrid conferences can be a solution and might even help to ensure inclusion
      and diversity. During the pandemic, organizing a conference in the online format
      let academic communities get used to the new model of scholarly communication.
      </p><p>But how do we make online experiences as likeable as meeting physically?
      I think the most important thing is: people online should not feel left out
      or disconnected. Besides some issues with technical equipment or internet connection,
      we often see them being forgotten during discussions. In that sense, ensuring
      every session host knows how to host hybrid conferences is essential.</p><p>Regarding
      social activities, pure online conferences usually rely on chatrooms or even
      games to proceed; however, it seems impossible to engage people online and offline
      in the same social activities at the same time, for example, having a city tour
      together. This requires creative thinking to come up with approaches that make
      the conference experience enjoyable for both offline and online participants.<br></p><h3>Looking
      forward to STI 2023</h3><p>Here I would like to express my gratitude again to
      the organizing committee of the STI 2022 conference! I really appreciate the
      idea of inviting more early career researchers to host sessions and organizing
      the WISP event to provide an excellent opportunity for female researchers to
      get to know each other, engage in conversations, and exchange experiences. Now
      I am looking forward to the next one \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">STI 2023 in Leiden</a>. The organizing committee has already

      target=\"_blank\">announced that it will be held in a hybrid way</a>. Moreover,
      the conference motto, \u201C<em>improving scholarly evaluation practice in the
      light of cultural change,</em>\u201D triggers the ambition of innovating the
      conference format as well as the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference\"

      organizers of the STI 2023 conference, we introduce two open science experiments:
      We adopt a new publication and peer review process and we invite authors of
      conference contributions to reflect on their open science practices.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">The adoption of open science practices has become a prominent topic
      of study for the science studies community. However, the research practices
      of the community itself are still quite traditional. While open access publishing,
      preprinting, open peer review, open data sharing, and other open science practices
      are gradually becoming more common in the science studies community, the adoption
      of these practices is still at a relatively low level.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Given
      the community\u2019s deep understanding of the research system, we think we
      should be able to do a better job. As organizers of this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://sti2023.org\"
      target=\"_blank\">Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators conference (STI
      2023)</a>, we therefore introduce two open science experiments: We adopt a new
      publication and peer review process, fully aligned with state-of-the-art open
      science practices, and we invite authors of contributions submitted to the conference
      to reflect on their own open science practices.<br></p><h3>Experiment 1: Opening
      the publication and peer review process</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In earlier editions
      of the STI conference, contributions submitted to the conference were reviewed
      in a traditional closed peer review process. Contributions accepted for presentation
      at the conference were published in the conference proceedings while those not
      accepted for presentation were not published.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the STI
      2023 conference, we are going to experiment with an open \u2018publish, then
      review\u2019 model as an alternative to the closed \u2018review, then publish\u2019
      approach. The publication and peer review process will be organized as follows:<br></p><ul><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The conference will use a submission and publication
      platform provided by <a href=\"https://orvium.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Orvium</a>.
      <em>All contributions submitted to the conference will immediately be published
      as a preprint on the platform.</em> Contributions will be openly accessible
      under a CC-BY license. Authors will retain their copyright. Each contribution
      will have its own DOI.</p></li></ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The conference
      will organize an open peer review process. <em>For each contribution submitted
      to the conference, the reviews will be published on the Orvium platform and
      will be linked to the preprint version of the contribution.</em> Reviewers will
      be encouraged to disclose their identity, but they may also choose to remain
      anonymous. Authors will be invited to update their contribution based on the
      feedback provided by reviewers. The updated contribution will also be published
      on the Orvium platform.</p></li></ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">As conference
      organizers, <em>we will use the peer review results to select contributions
      for presentation at the conference.</em> All contributions will remain available
      on the Orvium platform, both the contributions selected for presentation and
      those not selected.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Further information about the
      publication and peer review process of the STI 2023 conference can be found
      in the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/call-for-papers/\" target=\"_blank\">call
      for papers</a>. The \u2018publish, then review\u2019 model that we are going
      to use at the conference is inspired by platforms such as <a href=\"https://f1000research.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>F1000Research</em></a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83889\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>eLife</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://peercommunityin.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Peer Community In</em></a>, which <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg2283\"
      target=\"_blank\">combine preprinting and open peer review</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Expected
      benefits</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Compared with the publication and peer review
      process in earlier editions of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits
      in our new approach:<br></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Accelerating
      the dissemination of new scientific knowledge.</em> The immediate publication
      of conference contributions as preprints will speed up the dissemination of
      new scientific knowledge. Interested researchers and practitioners will have
      access to the latest scientific findings without waiting for the conference
      to take place.</p></li></ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Increasing
      the value of peer review.</em> In the traditional closed peer review model used
      in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviews were made available only
      to the authors of a conference contribution and to the conference organizers.
      In our new open peer review model, reviews will also be made available to the
      readers of a conference contribution, helping readers to develop a more informed
      understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of a contribution, also the ones
      not selected for presentation. This will increase the value of the reviews.</p></li></ul><ul><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Giving more recognition to authors.</em> The
      immediate publication of conference contributions as preprints will enable authors
      to get feedback and credit more rapidly.</p></li></ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><em>Giving more recognition to reviewers.</em> In the traditional
      closed peer review model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers
      hardly got any credit for their work. In our new open peer review model, reviewers
      who choose to disclose their identity will get public recognition.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Potential
      concerns</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We recognize that the publication and peer
      review process of the STI 2023 conference may also raise concerns. A common
      objection against preprinting is that preprints may present inaccurate results
      because they are published before peer review. While results presented in preprints
      may indeed be inaccurate, the same applies to results reported in peer-reviewed
      articles, since peer review usually does not resolve all inaccuracies in an
      article. We also note that the reviews that will be published alongside the
      preprinted conference contributions will help readers to assess the quality
      of a contribution. Another concern about preprinting is that journals might
      be reluctant to publish articles that have already been published as a preprint.
      However, very few journals still have such a policy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A common
      concern about open peer review is that criticism provided by reviewers may be
      incorrect or even offensive. As conference organizers, we call on reviewers
      to give constructive and respectful feedback, for instance by following the
      <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback\" target=\"_blank\">FAST
      (focused, appropriate, specific, transparent) principles</a>. We reserve the
      right to moderate reviews that we regard as disrespectful. If the authors of
      a conference contribution consider criticism provided by a reviewer to be incorrect,
      they will have the possibility to publish a response in which they explain why
      they disagree with the reviewer. Authors will also be able to update their conference
      contribution to address problems identified by reviewers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      appreciate that special consideration needs to be given to the interests of
      PhD students and other researchers who find themselves in vulnerable positions.
      These researchers may be disproportionately affected by the drawbacks of the
      way publication and peer review processes are organized. In a closed \u2018review,
      then publish\u2019 model, peer review may be biased against these researchers,
      lowering their chances of getting their work published. In an open \u2018publish,
      then review\u2019 model, these researchers may feel uncomfortable both about
      their own work being critiqued publicly and about publicly critiquing the work
      of others, in particular the work of more senior colleagues. In the evaluation
      of our new approach to publication and peer review (see below), we will pay
      special attention to the experiences of PhD students and other researchers in
      vulnerable positions.</p><h3>Experiment 2: Reflecting on open science practices</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">As organizers of the STI 2023 conference, we strongly encourage
      authors of contributions submitted to the conference to adopt open science practices
      in their work. At the same time, we recognize that there may be barriers to
      the adoption of such practices, including for instance reliance on proprietary
      data sources, legal or ethical concerns, and lack of experience with open science
      practices. Rather than introducing formal open science requirements, we therefore
      take a more experimental approach. We invite authors of conference contributions
      to explicitly reflect on their own open science practices.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Each
      contribution submitted to the conference is expected to include a short section
      in which the authors reflect on the use of open science practices in the research
      presented in their contribution.</em><strong></strong>Authors may for instance
      discuss the openness of the data used in their research. If the data is openly
      available, the authors can explain how the data can be obtained. If the data
      is not openly available, the authors can explain why they do not use openly
      available data or why they are unable to make their data openly available. Openness
      of software and source codes can be discussed in a similar way. Authors may
      also discuss whether a research plan was made openly available at the start
      of their research (\u2018preregistration\u2019) or whether any intermediate
      results of the research have already been published, for instance in a preprint.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We hope this experiment will increase the awareness and adoption
      of open science practices in the science studies community. In addition, the
      experiment may also help organizers of future conferences to better understand
      how the adoption of open science practices can be facilitated and promoted.<br></p><h3>Evaluating
      the experiments</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The above two experiments will hopefully
      provide an additional motivation to colleagues in the science studies community
      to submit their work to our conference. We are eager to see how the experiments
      will work out. After the conference, we will invite conference participants
      to fill in a survey to evaluate the experiments. The outcomes of the evaluation
      will be reported in a blog post. In the meantime, if you have any questions
      about the experiments, or any feedback you would like to share, don\u2019t hesitate
      to <a href=\"mailto:sti2023@cwts.leidenuniv.nl\">contact us</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Looking
      forward to meeting you at STI 2023!<br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ludo

      Research Assessment is discussed and used in many contexts. However, Responsible
      Research Assessment does not have a unifying definition, and likewise its guidelines
      indicate that the implementation of Responsible Research Assessment can have
      many different scopes.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Research
      assessment has a long history continuously introducing new methods, tools, and
      agendas, for example, peer review of publications dating back to 17<sup>th</sup>
      century and catalogues from the 19<sup>th</sup> century that facilitated publication
      counting. This blog post discusses Responsible Research Assessment (RRA), an
      agenda gaining attention today. The blog post gives an introduction to RRA and
      discusses how to navigate RRA guidelines, which can be a complex task.</p><h3>What
      is Responsible Research Assessment (RRA)?</h3><p>A search for definitions of
      RRA resulted in:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/\"
      target=\"_blank\">\"Responsible metrics as a way of framing appropriate uses
      of quantitative indicators in the governance, management and assessment of research\"</a></li><li><a
      href=\"http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-7998-2181-6.ch003\"
      target=\"_blank\">\"Responsible research evaluation focuses on producing research
      metrics that adhere to certain principles, such as data accuracy, transparent
      data collection and analysis or making use of a diversity of indicators.\"</a></li><li>RRA
      <a href=\"https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914\"
      target=\"_blank\">\"is an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which incentivise,
      reflect and reward the plural characteristics of high-quality research, in support
      of diverse and inclusive research cultures.\"</a></li></ul><p>Two definitions
      focus on principles for working with metrics, and the third on supporting diverse
      and inclusive research culture through research assessment. All are valid, and
      one unifying definition is still lacking. Also, the terminology varies. Assessment
      and evaluation or metrics and indicators are used interchangeably.</p><p>It
      can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what RRA is and getting an overview of
      RRA is equally complex. One approach, however, is RRA guidelines that explain
      RRA and guide its implementation. Some internationally well-known RRA guidelines
      are: <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Declaration
      on Research Assessment (DORA)</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wcrif.org/guidance/hong-kong-principles\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong Principles</a>, and <a href=\"https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/\"
      target=\"_blank\">SCOPE</a>.</p><p>A common starting point for RRA and its guidelines
      is that traditional quantitative research assessment and its emphasis on bibliometric
      indicators may be easy to apply but has many biases. Criticism of traditional
      indicators is seen, for example, in DORA leading to the recommendation not to
      use Journal Impact Factors for research funding, appointment, and promotion
      considerations.</p><p>Traditional quantitative research assessment is indicator-
      or data-driven, meaning that popular indicators\u2014for example the Journal
      Impact Factor\u2014or easily available data are the staring points of assessments.
      Instead, RRA focuses on the entity to be assessed and starts with what seems
      to be lacking in the traditional quantitative research assessments, for example,
      the values (cf. SCOPE), or the research integrity (cf. Hong Kong Principles)
      of the entity to be assessed.</p><h3>Who use RRA guidelines?</h3><p>Universities\u2019
      adoption of RRA guidelines is relatively new, and <a href=\"https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/results-from-the-2021-responsible-metrics-state-of-the-art-survey/\"
      target=\"_blank\">many universities use DORA or Leiden Manifesto, sometimes
      to develop local RRA policies</a>. It is possible to endorse DORA and Hong Kong
      Principles at their websites, and the long lists of signatories show that not
      only universities but also other institutions from the research sector support
      RRA, for example, funders, publishers, learned societies, governmental agencies,
      etc. Also, individuals are among the signatories.</p><p>RRA guidelines are not
      only relevant at the individual, local, and national level. The European Commission
      has published an agreement on how to reform research assessment. <a href=\"https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">The RRA guidelines contribute to the basis for the reform,
      and the guidelines are among the tools for the practical implementation of the
      reform</a>.</p><h3>What are the scopes of RRA guidelines?</h3><p>For institutions
      or individuals new to RRA, it can be difficult to navigate the guidelines. Which
      guidelines are relevant? What are the scopes of the guidelines? How are the
      guidelines applied? Etc.</p><p>To answer these questions, <a href=\"https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">the Evaluation Checklists Project Charter and its Criteria
      for Evaluation Checklists</a> is useful. The criteria are developed by experts
      from evaluation research with the mission to \u201Cadvance excellence in evaluation
      by providing high-quality checklists to guide practice\u201D and the vision
      \u201Dfor all evaluators to have the information they need to provide exceptional
      evaluation service and advance the public good\u201D.</p><p>Using the criteria
      <em>RRA guideline addresses one or more specific evaluation tasks</em> and <em>RRA
      guideline clarifies or simplifies complex content to guide performance of evaluation
      tasks</em>, it becomes apparent that the four guidelines mentioned earlier differ
      in their scopes: SCOPE aims to improve the assessment process, Hong Kong Principles
      wants to strengthen research integrity, Leiden Manifesto stresses accountability
      in metrics-based research assessment, and DORA focuses on assessment of research
      publications but also other types of output. (See also <a href=\"https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/87075445/Poster_NW2022_Bruun_Gauffriau.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">this poster from the Nordic Workshop on Bibliometrics and
      Research Policy</a>).</p><h3>How easy are RRA guidelines to use?</h3><p>Above
      it is shown that the first criteria can help understand the scope of a RRA guideline.
      Whether a guideline is easy to use may be addressed by the next sections of
      Criteria for Evaluation Checklists: <em>Clarity of Purpose</em>, <em>Completeness
      and Relevance</em>, <em>Organization</em>, <em>Clarity of Writing</em>, and
      <em>References and Sources</em>.</p><p>Especially, the criteria on <em>Clarity
      of Purpose</em> address how to use a checklist. Not all four RRA guidelines
      discussed here are clear on all of these criteria, i.e., the process of applying
      the guidelines instead of simply the result of using the guidelines. Here are
      some examples of how to meet these criteria and, thus, help the user applying
      the guideline:</p><p>SCOPE discusses the criterion <em>The circumstances in
      which it [the guideline] should be used</em> and concludes that research assessment
      and, thus, the use of SCOPE is not always the right solution. Assessment is
      not recommended to incentivize specific behaviours. For example, open access
      publishing would benefit more from making it easy for a researcher to comply
      than from measuring the researcher\u2019s share of open access publications.</p><p>DORA
      addresses the criterion <em>Intended users</em>. The sections in the guideline
      mention intended users. The users are funding agencies, research institutions,
      publishers, organizations that supply metrics, and researchers.</p><p>Leiden
      Manifesto and Hong Kong Principles, respectively, have relatively clear purposes
      because of their delimited scopes; accountability in metrics-based research
      assessment and strengthen research integrity.</p><p>The criteria sections <em>Completeness
      and Relevance</em>, <em>Organization</em>, <em>Clarity of Writing</em>, and
      <em>References and Sources</em> further review how well a guideline supports
      the RRA process. For example, the four guidelines provide illustrative examples
      and cases, but all aspects of an assessment task are not necessarily covered.
      And the guidelines are organized in sections, but it is not always clear how
      this organization supports the RRA process.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>RRA does
      not have a clear definition, and RRA guidelines can be difficult to apply. The
      Criteria for Evaluation Checklists provides a tool developed by evaluation researchers
      that can help users choose relevant RRA guidelines for their work. Applying
      the understanding of RRA guidelines constituted by the Evaluation Checklists
      Project Charter may also facilitate a systematic analysis of RRA guidelines
      that could lead to a clearer definition of RRA.</p><h3><sub>Acknowledgements</sub></h3><p><sub>This

      presence of science on Wikipedia is a recurrent research topic in the scientometric
      community. However, its full potential for the study of science-society relations
      has not yet been fully explored. These are some of the key facts to be considered
      when studying it.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Since
      its very beginnings, Wikipedia has been the target of criticism. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/oct/24/comment.newmedia\"
      target=\"_blank\">The first (and negative) comparisons</a> of its contents with
      those of other encyclopaedias are long gone, although the perception from <a
      href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/438900a\" target=\"_blank\">academia was more
      optimistic</a>. However, in education, the terrain in which this platform is
      most valuable, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7557/13.2377\" target=\"_blank\">the
      controversy is greater</a>. Its established use among students collides completely
      with the sceptical perception of part of the teachers. Despite this, there are
      more and more voices in favour of its use, as well as an increasing number of
      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:School_and_university_projects\">educational
      projects</a> that integrate it into the classroom. This conflict has yet to
      be resolved, although the general perception has progressively improved over
      time.</p><p>In the case of scientometrics, its community has been studying the
      presence of science on Wikipedia since before the formal <a href=\"http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/\">birth
      of \u2018altmetrics</a>\u2019. In most cases, however, these previous studies
      have mostly focused on the analysis of the scientific works mentioned on Wikipedia,
      rather than taking Wikipedia itself as their main research object. This science-centric
      focus typically overlooks the potential of exploring the different relationships
      that Wikipedia has (or doesn\u2019t have) with science. In this post I reflect
      about such potential by presenting five key facts about the nature of Wikipedia
      and its possibilities as a research source for the study of science-society
      interactions.</p><h3><strong>1) Why are scientific publications cited on Wikipedia?</strong></h3><p>The
      most common critique of Wikipedia has to do with the reliability of its contents,
      a problem that Wikipedia itself <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia\"
      target=\"_blank\">exhibits with complete transparency</a>. In its quest for
      reliability, Wikipedia places great importance on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\"
      target=\"_blank\">verifiability</a>, which is one of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies\"
      target=\"_blank\">core content policies</a>.</p><p>There are several issues
      in these content policy guidelines that cannot be overlooked when studying Wikipedia
      citations to scientific publications. Firstly, Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia.
      It may seem obvious, but as stated in its content policy guidelines, \"<em>Wikipedia
      does not publish </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>original research</em></a>\". Moreover, Wikipedia only
      publishes information of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content\"
      target=\"_blank\">encyclopaedic relevance</a>. Secondly, not all sources are
      valid as citations on Wikipedia. At the top of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources\"
      target=\"_blank\">list of source typologies</a> recommended by Wikipedia are
      peer-reviewed scientific publications. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-06-2018-0152\"
      target=\"_blank\">Books are one of the most relevant materials</a>. This relevance
      of books for Wikipedia has even led publishers to offer free access to their
      collections to Wikipedia editors via proposals such as <a href=\"https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">The Wikipedia Library</a>.</p><p>The fundamental difference
      between Wikipedia citations and scientific citations cannot be ignored, as the
      interpretation of these differs greatly. Thus, the dynamic nature of Wikipedia
      must be clearly understood. Contrary to the static nature of citations to scientific
      papers, which theoretically speaking can never decrease, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00171\"
      target=\"_blank\">the references in a Wikipedia article can indeed disappear</a>,
      and even reappear later. Analysing this phenomenon through a snapshot in which
      only the resources cited at a specific moment in time appear is useful, but
      it may hinder the consideration of all these fluctuations and specificities
      of Wikipedia citations.</p><h3><strong>2) Linguistic and cultural multiverses</strong></h3><p>Wikipedia
      is a decentralised medium whose management falls in the hands of its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community\"
      target=\"_blank\">community of editors</a>, also known as <em>wikipedians</em>,
      who dictate (many of) its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines\"
      target=\"_blank\">policies</a>, which must therefore have the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus\"
      target=\"_blank\">support of the community</a>. There is nothing immutable on
      Wikipedia. This is an important feature, resulting in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias\"
      target=\"_blank\">more than 300 language editions</a>, which are far from being
      mere translations. The community of <em>wikipedians</em>\r\nfor each edition
      (also known as <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedistas\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>wikipedistas</em></a> in Spanish, <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Wikip%C3%A9diens\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>wikip\xE9diens</em></a> in French or <a href=\"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedianen\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>wikipedianen</em></a> in Dutch) establishes their own
      policies and manages their contents. It is enough to take a quick look at the
      main page of the <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish</a>,
      <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">French</a> and <a href=\"https://nl.wikipedia.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dutch</a> Wikipedias to observe clear differences. In fact,
      even the design or the name itself can have a slight variation, see for example
      the case of the <a href=\"https://ca.wikipedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Catalan
      Viquip\xE8dia</a> or the <a href=\"https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia\">Galician
      </a><a href=\"https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Galipedia</em></a>.
      This obviously has an impact on the contents, which may introduce <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054\"
      target=\"_blank\">cultural </a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054\">biases</a>.</p><p>Although
      the edits made to Wikipedia articles can come from users who contribute independently,
      there are also communities organised around topics. These are the so-called
      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject\" target=\"_blank\">WikiProjects</a>.
      Each of them is focused on a specific topic, for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Astronomy\"
      target=\"_blank\">astronomy</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cats\">cats</a>
      or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lady_Gaga\"
      target=\"_blank\">Lady Gaga</a>. Just as each language edition has complete
      autonomy, so do the WikiProjects. Each one establishes its own specific guidelines
      for the development and improvement of the project's articles of interest. They
      can provide recommendations, such as following a specific structure, or even
      offer suggested literature, as in the case of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lepidoptera\"
      target=\"_blank\">lepidoptera WikiProject</a>. Some of these activities can
      thus affect the contents of an entire block of articles. In addition, especially
      in the case of the English Wikipedia edition, WikiProjects organise the articles
      in a very remarkable way. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment\"
      target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia articles are classified</a> according to two criteria:
      the <em>quality</em> of the article and its <em>importance </em>or priority
      for the WikiProject in question. The use of references plays a key role in establishing
      one categorisation or another. It should be noted that this assignment is made
      freely by <em>wikipedians</em>, although the more advanced categories (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria\"
      target=\"_blank\">Featured</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_criteria\"
      target=\"_blank\">Good Article</a>) depend on a more centralised and standardised
      system with a particular system of nomination and voting.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure.png\"
      data-image=\"30714\"><figcaption style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\">Average
      length (in bytes) and referenced publications of Wikipedia articles by quality
      level</figcaption></figure><h3><em><br></em>3) Life beyond Wikipedia articles</h3><p>In
      Wikipedia, the contents of articles are the result of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus\"
      target=\"_blank\">consensus</a>. This is not always possible and results in
      a high number of edits in which several editors try to get ahead of each other
      in their respective points of view. Wikipedia refers to these conflicts as <a
      href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring\" target=\"_blank\"><em>edit
      wars</em></a>, and some of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars\"
      target=\"_blank\">the most regrettable ones</a>\r\nhave been documented. These
      conflicts are frequent in articles concerning more sensitive and topical issues.
      When one of these wars takes place, the community tries to reach a consensus
      on its own or with the intervention of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee\"
      target=\"_blank\">committee</a> formed to help resolve it.</p><p>Furthermore,
      <em>wikipedians</em> have the possibility to discuss the contents of articles
      openly with the rest of the community. Something that often goes unnoticed on
      Wikipedia is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages\" target=\"_blank\">talk
      page</a> (you can find the link to it next to the article title), where editors
      do not only leave messages related to changes made or proposed changes, but
      also allow these contents to be discussed for improvement. The scientific literature
      also has a place in these discussions, for example by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Impact_factor/Archive_1#Published_article_to_consider_for_citation\"
      target=\"_blank\">commenting on publications of interest for citation</a> in
      the article or by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Homeopathy/Archive_41#Reliable_source_for_%22fringe%22\"
      target=\"_blank\">being used as support for the statements made in the discussions</a>.</p><table

      the contents of Wikipedia classified by topics?</h3><p>The way in which content
      is classified by topics on Wikipedia has its ups and downs. Wikipedia's main
      system is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories\"
      target=\"_blank\">categories</a> (<a href=\"https://elib.dlr.de/188534/\" target=\"_blank\">not
      to be confused with Wikidata Concepts</a>), a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2017.sep.20\"
      target=\"_blank\">folksonomy</a> which, in the English edition Wikipedia alone,
      includes <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6967464\" target=\"_blank\">2
      million categories</a>. As an example of the usefulness and representativeness
      of these, the Wikipedia article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bibliometrics</a> has only one category (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bibliometrics\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bibliometrics</a>), while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price\"
      target=\"_blank\">Derek J. de Solla Price</a>'s article has 16, with some such
      as \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1922_births\" target=\"_blank\">1922
      births</a>\u2019 and \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1983_deaths\"
      target=\"_blank\">1983 deaths</a>\u2019. This problem is undermined by the hierarchical
      relationships established between them. Because a category may have more than
      one parent category, it is difficult to establish a single broad topic for each
      Wikipedia article.</p><p>In addition, Wikipedia has other systems that also
      organise its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents\" target=\"_blank\">contents
      by topic</a> and make browsing easier. Some of these are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews\"
      target=\"_blank\">overview articles</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Lists\"
      target=\"_blank\">lists</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals\"
      target=\"_blank\">portals</a>. Systems such as WikiProjects can also be used
      for this purpose, as they delimit articles related to a topic. There is also
      no shortage of machine learning applications, such as <a href=\"https://ores.wikimedia.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ORES</a>, an article topic model that predicts the topic of
      an article.<em><br></em><br></p><figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://tinyurl.com/ybqgqmy8\"

      Wikipedia as the ultimate social media for measuring social attention</strong></h3><p>Finally,
      there is a wide range of metrics that can be obtained from Wikipedia to understand
      the different interactions taking place at Wikipedia. In this regard, it is
      worth recalling that Wikipedia is one of the websites with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites\"
      target=\"_blank\">highest traffic worldwide</a>. It is in fact easy to find
      Wikipedia articles at the top of web search engine results, attracting millions
      of visits. Furthermore, not only is there an English Wikipedia, which is the
      largest one and can be used as a proxy for international forms of attention,
      but there are also different language editions that can be used to capture local
      attention. All things considered, what we have is a perfect social thermometer,
      the usefulness of which has already been noted, for example, for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892\"
      target=\"_blank\">monitoring outbreaks</a>.</p><p>The number of times an article
      has been edited, as well as the unique number of editors involved, can shed
      light on which articles are most active and interesting for the Wikipedia community
      to engage with. In the case of discussions, these can even be seen as a proxy
      for identifying controversial content. On the other hand, the years since the
      creation of the article and its length make it possible to characterise the
      article, while the number of references to scientific articles reflects the
      scientific orientation or interest of the article. The possibilities are numerous,
      go far beyond these more general approaches, and many have yet to be explored.</p><p>What
      is certain is that only by paying attention to these aspects when analysing
      science in this social medium will it be possible to understand the role that
      science plays in Wikipedia, beyond its greater or lesser presence, as well as
      the implications and reach of these resources within the community of editors
      and society in general.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Wenceslao

      many former Twitter users looking for alternatives, the decentralised Mastodon
      platform is on the rise. But decentralisation alone is not enough: institutions
      should take responsibility and host their own Mastodon server.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">Ever since Elon Musk took over Twitter, there has been a steady
      stream of Twitter users looking for alternatives, such as <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>. This alternative is part of a larger federation
      of social media services called the <a href=\"https://axbom.com/fediverse/\"
      target=\"_blank\">fediverse</a>, which includes not only a Twitter-like platform
      such as Mastodon, but also Instagram-like photo sharing and TikTok-like video
      sharing platforms for example. The key idea is that this social media infrastructure
      is decentralised, having no central authority that oversees or manages everything.
      Any user on any part of the federated social media can follow any other user,
      across services, platforms and servers. Perhaps the easiest to understand analogy
      is email: from a personal mail address like <a href=\"mailto:v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl\"
      target=\"_blank\">v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl</a> you can reach anybody else,
      regardless of whether they have a Gmail address, a Hotmail address or another
      institutional mail address.<br></p><h3>Trust and moderation</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">You
      might wonder what the benefit of this decentralised alternative is over established
      social media such as Twitter, Instagram or TikTok. We believe that part of its
      potential benefit is that it addresses two large problems of social media: trust
      and moderation. Social media plays an increasing role in societal debates, and
      we have a special interest in understanding <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/monitoring-the-dissemination-of-covid-19-related-scientific-publications-in-online-media\">the
      role of science in such debates</a>. Social media suffer from various problematic
      aspects. There are concerns of the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/fake-news-spreads-faster-true-news-twitter-thanks-people-not-bots\"
      target=\"_blank\">spread of misinformation</a>, concerns of large swaths of
      <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03034-5\" target=\"_blank\">bots
      and \u201Cfake\u201D accounts</a>, and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/19/its-the-era-of-the-twitter-pile-on-isnt-there-something-healthier-we-can-do-with-our-rage\"
      target=\"_blank\">attacks on individual users</a>. Although social media have
      increasingly tried to deal with this, it remains a rather daunting task.<br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Addressing problems of trust and moderation requires more than just
      decentralised social media. At the moment, many Mastodon servers are run by
      volunteers, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/\"
      target=\"_blank\">some servers reached their limits</a> under the strain of
      the millions of users migrating from Twitter to Mastodon recently. Although
      such volunteer activity is supported by generous donations, this is unlikely
      to scale to the hundreds of millions of Twitter users. Moderation is also run
      by volunteers, and scaling this to many millions of users is very challenging,
      running into exactly the same problems that Twitter and Facebook are facing.
      These established social media employ <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/twitter-content-moderation-musk-midterms-1849726968\"
      target=\"_blank\">hundreds</a> or even <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/\"
      target=\"_blank\">thousands</a> of moderators, while problematic messages keep
      flowing through the cracks. Moreover, moderation should not be in the hands
      of the few, and Twitter or Facebook should not unilaterally get to decide for
      the world what should be allowed and what should not.<br></p><h3>Host server</h3><p>We
      propose that institutions should step up and take responsibility and host their
      own servers. Institutions, like universities, research centres, newspapers,
      publishers, broadcast companies, ministries and NGOs, all have a role to play
      in shaping the discussion on social media, without any single institution being
      in control. We believe that institutions setting up their own servers brings
      three benefits.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">First, by hosting their own servers, institutions
      contribute to trust and verification of users. Many institutions already have
      established and verified domain names, such as <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">cwts.nl</a> for our own institution, and this helps to establish
      a trusted presence on social media. Within the federated social media, accounts
      would be clearly associated with that domain name, for example <a href=\"https://social.cwts.nl/@vtraag\"
      target=\"_blank\">@vtraag@social.cwts.nl</a>, clearly establishing that these
      users belong to that institution. Institutions can limit users to staff members
      only and verify their identity, thus establishing a trusted presence. Users
      may benefit from the institutional connection, and as some have argued, this
      could establish an organisation as <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/your-org-run-mastodon.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">a trustworthy brand</a>, making Mastodon a more suitable platform
      for institutions than Twitter, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/11/10/academics-can-easily-leave-twitters-town-square-but-it-will-be-much-harder-for-their-institutions/\"
      target=\"_blank\">instead of less</a>.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, institutions
      with their own servers would contribute to the moderation of social media. Institutions
      need to take responsibility for moderating the behaviour of users of their own
      server. This means that institutions should implement a clear moderation policy
      for their social media presence. This is how it should be: different contexts
      may require different moderation policies. For example, researchers may have
      different obligations and responsibilities than the general public. This way,
      institutions could help ensure that debates take place more respectfully. At
      the same time, institutions would also help to ensure that people are able to
      express themselves freely and safely.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thirdly, establishing
      institutional servers makes decentralised social media sustainable. As we already
      noted, it is unlikely that the current system will scale to millions of people
      based on voluntary contributions. By stepping up and providing their own servers,
      institutions provide a critical part of the necessary infrastructure. Not only
      in monetary terms, but also in terms of time investment for verification and
      moderation.<br></p><h3>CWTS initiative</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This is why at CWTS
      we have now launched our own social media server at <a href=\"https://social.cwts.nl\"
      target=\"_blank\">social.cwts.nl</a>. Only people who are affiliated with CWTS
      can register for an account on this server. In practice, this means that CWTS
      staff members can register for an account using their institutional email address.
      We have written a moderation policy, and set up a moderation committee that
      will advise on any violations of this moderation policy to the management. The
      management would not moderate messages directly, and only rely on the moderation
      committee, thus providing some necessary checks and balances. We trust CWTS
      staff members to behave responsibly in accordance with this moderation policy.
      We will not actively check every message being posted, but reported messages
      will be followed up on. <br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Does this initiative solve all
      problems of social media? Surely not. Institutional users presumably represent
      only a small minority of social media users. How the large public will find
      its way on Mastodon is not yet clear. This initiative will not directly reduce
      societal polarisation, but it may help establish a trusted social media presence
      of researchers who can engage in societal debates. It also expands the breadth
      of social media platforms that researchers can use to interact with broader
      communities. We believe that setting up our own server is a step forward, and
      we hope to see other institutions taking similar initiatives.<br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Vincent

      on funding acknowledgments is in ascendance, with more data available and more
      studies done. Yet, there are specific challenges in accurately capturing this
      type of data. This blog post looks at a single publication&#039;s acknowledgment
      section in order to discuss several of these challenges.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>In June of this year, <a
      href=\"https://www.orfg.org/news/2022/6/16/orfg-issues-community-call-to-improve-research-output-tracking\"
      target=\"_blank\">the Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) published an open letter</a>
      to the wider academic community with a call towards improving research output
      tracking. Funding acknowledgments were a particular focal point. In <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements\"
      target=\"_blank\">the previous blog post in this series</a>, we already addressed
      several issues at play in funding acknowledgment data sets. In this second installment,
      we examine a specific real-life example  of one funding acknowledgment within
      which many of the issues presented in that previous post come together. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.007\"
      target=\"_blank\">The article in question</a> was published in the <em>Journal
      of Molecular Biology</em>, with the research being primarily conducted at the
      College of Medicine, Florida State University. </p><p>In this blog post, we
      suggest a taxonomy of different types of acknowledgment, all of which co-occur
      regularly in acknowledgment sections of published articles. In the reproduced
      acknowledgment section below, these different types are color-coded. We will
      show how different bibliographic databases parse and extract funding agencies
      and/or grant numbers from this text, and how they can all end up with a different
      result. By doing so, we would like to make clear that assigning funding agencies
      to publications is a process with a level of ambiguity, a process that relies
      at least partly on interpretation.</p><blockquote style=\"margin-left:32px;

      main types of acknowledgment:</p><ul><li><span style=\"color:blue;\">Personal
      acknowledgment:</span> Individuals being acknowledged for their roles in the
      research process</li><li><span style=\"color:green;\">Financial support:</span>
      \r\nReference to grants, contracts, or any phrasing that elucidates the financial
      component of the acknowledgment (terms like \u201Cfunded\u201D, \u201Cfinancially
      supported\u201D, etc.)</li><li><span style=\"color:red;\">Logistics acknowledgment:</span>
      \r\nReference to the use of facilities, materials and/or machines used in the
      research process</li></ul><p>When bibliometric databases count funding acknowledgments,
      it is important to accurately make the above distinctions, since different analyses
      require inclusion and exclusion of different acknowledgment types. This can
      already be difficult to ascertain when the wording in the acknowledgment text
      is ambiguous (i.e., is \u201CAuthor A was supported by Harvard\u201D a financial
      acknowledgment?) or when the logistic support comes with a grant or contract
      number.</p><p>That latter distinction, between grant and contract, is important
      to note on its own terms:</p><ul><li><strong>Grant</strong>: in referencing
      <span style=\"color:green;\">grant 0655133B from the American Heart Association</span>,
      the authors are referencing a specific grant number.</li><li><strong>Contract</strong>:
      the authors also reference <span style=\"color:green;\">Contract No. W-31-109-Eng-38</span>,
      a <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_DEAC0298CH10886_8900_-NONE-_-NONE-\"
      target=\"_blank\">contract</a>\r\nawarded by the US Department of Energy, Basic
      Energy Sciences, Office of Science.</li></ul><p>These types of financial support
      are distinct in their structure and function. While the case can be made for
      either type to be included as a funding acknowledgment, adding them up without
      distinction can feel like comparing apples and reds. Whether the financial support
      counted pertains to researchers\u2019 salaries, a tailored grant, or a large
      government contract for a laboratory can be an important difference depending
      on one\u2019s analysis.</p><h3>Different interpretations from bibliometric databases</h3><p>The
      idea that acknowledgment texts are highly interpretable can be observed in how
      different databases capture the acknowledgments of this example paper. The tables
      below show the resulting funding organizations when using the Web of Science,
      Dimensions, Scopus and Crossref databases respectively.</p><div align=\"center\"><p><strong>Web
      of Science:</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th width=\"150\" align=\"left\">Grant

      comparing these results with the original acknowledgment text, the different
      databases clearly exhibit varying degrees of accuracy.</p><p>Dimensions and
      Scopus provide the most comprehensive results, identifying financial support
      from both the US Department of Energy and the American Heart Association. In
      comparison, Web of Science only identifies the US Department of Energy and Crossref
      only identifies the American Heart Association.  </p><p>In addition to this,
      the results from Dimensions also list the Argonne National Laboratory which
      is not mentioned in the acknowledgment text. After further investigation it
      was found that the Advanced Photon Source is located at Argonne National Laboratory.
      This is a complicated case precisely because it can be partly categorized as
      logistical support (\u201CUse of the Advanced Photon Source\u201D) and partly
      financial (the mentioned contract). However, we would argue that having the
      Argonne National Laboratory as the funder here is debatable since the funding
      that is in play here is from the US Department of Energy <em>to </em>the Argonne
      National Laboratory. Arguably, the support from Argonne National Laboratory
      is logistical, while the support from the US Department of Energy is financial
      yet of a more indirect type than the American Heart Association.</p><p>Furthermore,
      there is also a variability in the identification of grant numbers by the different
      databases. Web of Science and Scopus only find a grant number for the US Department
      of Energy, whereas Dimensions and Crossref only find a grant number for the
      American Heart Association.</p><h3>Extracting and identifying funding acknowledgements</h3><p>The
      variation in the results can be partly explained by the different approaches
      taken by the databases for the extraction and identification of funding acknowledgment
      data.</p><p><a href=\"http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/webofscience/fundingsearch/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Web of Science extracts and displays</a> the raw (source)
      text from the acknowledgment text, while Dimensions only displays the resulting
      assignment to an organization in the <a href=\"https://www.grid.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">GRID
      database</a> it uses. To end up with this assignment, <a href=\"https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018861-what-is-the-difference-between-funded-by-and-supporting-grants-shown-on-a-publication-page-\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions uses a combination</a> of \u201Ctext-mining the
      \u2018Acknowledgments\u2019 or \u2018Funding\u2019 section\u201D and \u201Cstructured
      metadata received from some of our publication data sources, e.g., Crossref
      or PubMed\u201D. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/\"
      target=\"_blank\">funder registry used by Crossref</a> was donated by Elsevier,
      and is combined with acknowledgment and grant information provided to Crossref
      by publishers and funding agencies in order to connect the funders in the registry
      to publications. Scopus extracts organizations from the acknowledgment text
      and <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/funder-registry\"
      target=\"_blank\">matches them to the Crossref funding registry</a>.</p><p>These
      methodological differences can result in the potential loss of discerning information
      regarding the identification of funding organizations. For example, in the acknowledgment
      text the reference to the US Department of Energy consists of three parts: the
      funding agency (US Department of Energy), the funding programme (Basic Energy
      Sciences) and the programme office (Office of Science).</p><p>Web of Science
      identifies this information as one funder, including the hierarchical structure
      of the organization within the name. In comparison, Scopus lists these different
      levels as separate organizations, resulting in the identification of three funders
      where there should only be one. </p><p>It is also important to note that the
      relationships between the organizations are not documented within the funding
      registry created by Web of Science. The hierarchical relationships between different
      organizations are available within the Crossref and GRID registries used by
      the other databases, allowing organizations to be aggregated into higher-level
      entities.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>These types of discrepancies in funding acknowledgments
      are not rare. The standards and practices of what or whom to acknowledge <a
      href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185578\" target=\"_blank\">vary
      depending on the field of study,</a> with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22692\"
      target=\"_blank\">cultural factors</a> also playing a role.</p><p>The above
      example illustrates certain nuances that one needs to be aware of when analyzing
      funding acknowledgment databases; each database captures and interprets the
      data differently and the exact nature of the acknowledgment is not always obvious.
      Moreover, it also shows that counting acknowledgments is not a straightforward
      task, with one paper resulting in either 1, 2, 3 or 4 acknowledgments depending
      on which bibliographic database you refer to.</p><p>It would be helpful if bibliographic
      data providers were more forthcoming on the decision processes that lie behind
      such results as shown above. How do they distinguish funding acknowledgments
      from other types of acknowledgments? Why do they include certain mentioned organizations
      in the text and ignore others? For some data providers, it is also not clear
      whether the connected funder is extracted from the text or derived from other
      sources, such as data provided by the publisher or funder. Here, too, transparency
      would be helpful for those using the data.</p><p>Finally, though one standardized
      format of writing acknowledgments could never fit every case, as mentioned in
      the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements\"
      target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, using <a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/nwo-persistent-identifier-strategy-will-lead-increased-efficiency-and-insight\"
      target=\"_blank\">persistent identifiers</a> and templates provided by funders
      can help to streamline the processing of this data.</p><p><em>Part 2 of the

      to evaluate strategic partnerships? International officers of six universities
      asked this simple yet challenging question. CWTS and STIS participated and decided
      to co-create with the international officers. The result is an evaluation framework
      that looks unlike anything they had imagined.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Researchers collaborate across
      borders and continents. Students go on exchange and go study abroad. Nothing
      new so far. Yet formalised international strategic partnerships between universities
      are more recent. These agreements include both research and education and cover
      a range of departments. And they are expected to contribute to strategic goals
      and have great impact.</p><p>The University of Edinburgh is involved in a range
      of strategic partnerships, and noticed a lack of consistent, aligned evaluation
      practices. It proved a challenge to assess whether to enter into an agreement
      with a potential partner, or whether a strategic partnership indeed delivered
      its expectations, let alone to discuss this with their strategic partners. They
      invited five of their strategic partners (Universities of Copenhagen, Helsinki,
      Leiden, Sydney, and University College Dublin) to join hands, develop an evaluation
      framework and publish a handbook. The framework had to be based on state-of-the-art
      literature and had to lead to clear assessments of strategic partnerships. </p><figure

      data-image=\"29877\"></figure><p>Enter Leiden University\u2019s CWTS and the
      University of Edinburgh's Science, Technology and Innovation Studies (STIS).
      We were asked to contribute to the project, given our expertise in research
      assessment, research governance and STIS\u2019s knowledge of collaboration and
      internationalization.</p><p>The literature review by STIS is extensive and rich
      and covers internationalization, mobility, and environmental impacts of international
      collaboration. Yet it was not straightforward to find literature immediately
      relevant for international strategic partnerships between universities, nor
      on the evaluation of such agreements. Therefore, we first unpacked the notion
      of international strategic partnerships, to understand the different forms and
      formats it can take. This approach delivered keywords for a broader literature
      review, which put forward various, separate bodies of literature that are all
      relevant to international partnerships. The literature review provided our evidence
      base to develop the framework. And more on (the literature review on) internationalisation
      in an upcoming blogpost by Rodrigo Liscovsky.  </p><p>As strategic international
      partnerships come in different shapes and forms, we had doubts from the start
      about the feasibility to develop a simple framework, with straightforward guidelines
      on data and a clear assessment as result. To ensure the framework could be used
      in a variety of situations, we wanted to take the context into account. Context
      is relevant both in terms of governance (e.g. how the evaluation is used), as
      well as in terms of the partnership, including the history of the partnership,
      its goals and implementation plan.</p><p></p><p>Some examples to illustrate
      the diversity the framework needed to cover. According to the definition developed
      by our partners, strategic partnerships include both research and education.
      However, it soon became clear that some of their strategic partnerships are
      research only. In addition, according to their definition, strategic partnerships
      are between universities, while we also heard about partnerships with a variety
      of partners, including local authorities. Also, a strategic partnership should
      be university wide. Yet several of the partnerships are focused on one or two
      topics only. And regarding use and governance: we noticed that some universities
      wanted to use evaluation to gain insight into the partnership and develop recommendations
      for improvement, whereas in other universities the evaluation was going to be
      used to inform decisions.</p><p></p><p>We heard a lot about the strategic importance
      of partnerships, little about its implementation and management, and even less
      about their evaluation. We realized that whatever framework we would develop,
      it would differ substantively from the expectations of a comprehensive evaluation
      tool. Instead, we felt we needed to address simple implementation and evaluation
      questions, and we wanted to ensure the framework could be used in different
      governance systems, and at any time in a partnership (before, during, towards
      the end). We therefore started to think of a framework consisting of a set of
      questions and were inspired by examples such as the <a href=\"https://thinkingtool.eu/#:~:text=The%20thinking%20tool%20offers%20practical,with%20societal%20needs%20and%20expectations.\"
      target=\"_blank\">Societal Readiness Thinking Tool</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.toolboxbeleidsevaluaties.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Toolbox Policy Evaluation</a> (in Dutch).</p><p>We realized
      that in order to develop a useful evaluation framework, we had to collaborate
      closely with the international officers from the six partner universities and
      take them along in the development. We proposed to develop the framework on
      the go. One of us had done so before, when developing a societal impact approach
      with and for research infrastructures in the <a href=\"https://www.accelerate2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/D-1.5-Final-Assessment-Protocol.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">ACCELERATE</a>\r\nproject. We asked each of the six partners
      to do a case study, i.e., to evaluate an existing strategic partnership and
      we offered to guide them through this approach. We also suggested to use a \u201Clogbook\u201D
      and keep notes of any changes in the evaluation, new insights, eye-openers,
      questions, etc. </p><p>As a result, our partners contributed evaluations of,
      in random order, their very first partnership; a research collaboration focused
      on two topics and two universities; a research collaboration of one university
      with a variety of partners in a specific region; the portfolio of partners in
      one continent and university wide collaborations covering research, education
      as well as professional staff. </p><p>We organized four online meetings with
      each partner and planned to address different topics in every meeting. The topic
      of the first meeting was the history, rationale and context of the partnership
      and the reason to evaluate. The result would be a clear evaluation question.
      The second meeting was dedicated to data collection, the third to analysis of
      the data and the fourth and final to the interpretation of the evidence collected,
      and the formulation of the assessment of the partnership. </p><p>In practice
      the flow was iterative, and new topics arose every time. Composing the evaluation
      question was not easy at all and required many reformulations. The history and
      rationale of a partnership were addressed in subsequent meetings. The implementation
      of the partnership and the roles and responsibilities were brought up more than
      once. And when several partners wanted to reach out to researchers and students,
      we spent ample time talking about qualitative research methods such as interviews
      and surveys.</p><figure style=\"float:left; margin-right:15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture2_2022-11-23-154707_revp.png\"
      data-image=\"30189\"></figure><p>According to their own account, our partners
      lost confidence when they first started working on their case. They grappled
      with the complexity of contextual factors and the variety of perspectives of
      students, researchers, administrators, and the partner university. However,
      after four online meetings, they  regained confidence when we met in person
      for the very first time. They presented and discussed their evaluations, thought
      along with each other, and advised on next steps. Several mentioned that it
      was all about asking the right questions and they asked each other the right
      questions indeed.</p><p>In the end, the  framework we developed together is
      basically a series of questions. About the context of the evaluation (Why evaluate?
      What is the goal?); about the specific evaluation (What is the evaluation about?
      What is the central question?); and about the context of the partnership (What
      is the history? What are the targets?). Plus, it includes an extensive methodological
      section. When we presented the framework, our partners recognised the questions
      and accepted it as a useful framework.</p><figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:15px;\"><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture3_2022-11-23-155045_hwwc.png\"
      data-image=\"30191\"></figure><p>The final phase of the project was the development
      of the handbook. We described the framework, completed the literature review
      and our partners described their evaluation. Perhaps the most interesting chapter
      is Lessons Learnt from the EVALUATE project, written by our partners. Remember
      how they struggled with the diverse perspectives? They now acknowledge the variety
      of perspectives, suggest taking these into account and use participative methods.
      They provide recommendations on such diverse topics as data collection, the
      use of evaluation and the implementation of strategic partnerships. They question
      unrealistic expectations and bold claims, such as turning students into \u201Cglobal
      citizens\u201D or using research to address \u201Cglobal challenges\u201D. And
      they advise thinking about evaluation as an opportunity to build capacity and
      involve and inspire partners. </p><p>We had hoped that talking about evaluation
      of strategic partnerships would lead to changes in the management and implementation.
      And indeed, when we met for the second time, we noticed how our partners were
      changing their practice. Several had discussed expectations and intentions with
      their partner universities, as well as within their own university. Something
      they hardly did before. Moreover, they wanted to reach out to partner universities
      outside of Europe and Australia and use the experience, and the framework, for
      these partnerships as well. </p><p>But we need to be realistic. In general,
      many see strategic partnerships as, well, of strategic importance. They expect
      great contributions, however small the partnership. And when it comes to the
      newest development of university alliances, expectations are even grander. Four
      universities involved in EVALUATE, including the universities where we are based,
      are part of <a href=\"https://www.una-europa.eu/about/manifesto\" target=\"_blank\">Una
      Europa</a>. The alliance believes a university is created by and for society
      and as such driven to be of relevance, impact and high quality. It is a laboratory
      of the here and now, where creativity and experimentation unlock the hidden
      potentials of tomorrow. Who is against this creed? Not many, we guess. But what
      does it mean in practice? What is the evidence? How can this be assessed? Let\u2019s
      talk about our partnership!</p><p>EVALUATE is funded under ERASMUS+ Key Action
      2. </p><p>This blogpost is based on the experience of the authors with the EVALUATE

      is starting a new UNESCO Chair on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science.
      In this blog post we outline why this topic matters and how our team aims to
      contribute to UNESCO&#039;s agenda of making science a positive force for development.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">Created in 1992, the <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/education/unitwin\"
      target=\"_blank\">UNITWIN/UNESCO Chair programme</a> is intended to support
      developing expertise in areas related to UNESCO\u2019s mandate, such as education,
      culture, communication and the natural and social sciences. This network of
      over 850 institutions in 117 countries mobilises knowledge to address pressing
      societal challenges and contribute to development. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">UNESCO
      has developed the 2017 <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers</a> and
      the 2021 <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Open Science</a>, building on the notions
      that science is a <em>common good</em>, that all humankind should <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/human-rights/science\"
      target=\"_blank\">enjoy the benefits of scientific knowledge</a> and has the
      right to participate in it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you agree on this understanding
      of science as a <em>common good, </em>you may reply: \u201Call right, yes, science
      is a common good, but right now:<br></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Who benefits from
      science?</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Which type of research topics are considered important?</li><li
      dir=\"ltr\">Who participates in making science and deciding which knowledge
      is produced?\u201D</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The answers to
      each of these questions point in the same direction: science is heavily concentrated
      towards the interest of the privileged and it supports forms of innovation that
      <a href=\"https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/\"
      target=\"_blank\">actively contribute to world inequalities</a>. For science
      to be a common good, there is a need for diversity and inclusion, which means:<br></p><ul><li
      dir=\"ltr\">Widening the distribution  of the benefits of science across populations.</li><li
      dir=\"ltr\">Pluralising research topics.</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Broadening participation
      and activities in knowledge production, both of citizens and the academic workforce.</li></ul><p
      dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The new CWTS UNESCO Chair on Diversity and Inclusion
      in Global Science  aims to contribute to the implementation of the 2017 and
      2021 UNESCO Recommendations through a focus on Diversity and Inclusion in Global
      Science, in collaboration with a variety of research and policy partners in
      the world. </p><h3><strong>Why does the diversity of research topics matter
      for global science?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It <a href=\"https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2110158660/2110158660.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">has long been argued</a> that, in general, diversity in research
      is beneficial because: </p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">it fosters new ideas through
      recombination, for example in terms of interdisciplinarity; </li><li dir=\"ltr\">it
      is an insurance against incertitude, given that we don\u2019t know what the
      best solutions to problems are, it\u2019s better to try out different avenues;</li><li
      dir=\"ltr\">it prevents research from lock-in, i.e., it keeps the flexibility
      to adapt knowledge in the face of changing environments;</li><li dir=\"ltr\">it
      accommodates plural perspectives, i.e., it allows science to reflect the contrasting
      views on issues that exist in society.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">If we think of
      science as a key element for improving well-being and human development, diversity
      of knowledge is even more important. This is because research agendas are too
      often concentrated towards the issues and the framings that are relevant to
      the Global North and for powerful or privileged actors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">The historical role of science in colonialism and environmental
      degradation would be examples of this concentration of research towards the
      interest of the powerful. On the contrary, there is relatively much less research
      in topics which are more relevant for example for women, the Global South or
      some ethnic or indigenious groups.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">Research efforts across diseases</a> is a classic example
      of this: there is little research not only in some tropical diseases such as
      malaria, but also in topics such as cardiovascular diseases which affect poor
      populations, in comparison to investments in diseases such as cancers which
      are relatively more frequent in the richest populations.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/who.png\"
      data-image=\"29852\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another example
      of imbalance is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10385\" target=\"_blank\">artificial
      intelligence</a>. In this case, research is concentrated in topics that are
      relevant to big corporations rather than research involving other methods that
      are more useful to consider the societal and ethical implications of AI.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In short, making the contents of research more
      diverse is important for science to address the scientific problems associated
      with the challenges that matter to most people in the world.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><h3><strong>Why
      is inclusion of social groups important for global science?</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, for research to address a wider variety
      of topics, and especially societal challenges, it is necessary that science
      is more representative of the world population. Plural representation is both
      <a href=\"https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/12492/stirling_2005_opening.pdf?sequence=1\">a
      normative and substantive imperative</a>. In other words, researchers must come
      from a broader variety of social backgrounds and citizens must participate more
      actively in shaping knowledge so that science is more democratic and reflects
      plural interests and needs. For this purpose, science also needs to be created
      and shared in local languages (as suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.helsinki-initiative.org/\"><em>Helsinki
      Initiative on Multilingualism</em></a>) and through <a href=\"https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/\">open
      scholarly infrastructures</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In recent
      decades, science is already undergoing a transformation in this direction, with
      the growth of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/collections/cihfchiheh\">citizen
      science</a>, and the increasing participation of concerned groups such as <a
      href=\"https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/engagement-and-participation-in-research/involve-patients.htm\">patients</a>,
      or marginalised groups in dimensions such as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/shefigures2021/index.html\">gender</a>,
      ethnicity or Global South countries.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">However,
      many social groups still remain heavily underrepresented and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-022-00031-8/index.html\">face
      discriminatory working conditions</a> or lack of academic freedom, and stakeholder
      engagement in science remains a challenge. There is still a lot of progress
      to be made so that science reflects the plurality of world societies.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"></p><h3><strong>How will the CWTS Chair contribute to UNESCO\u2019s
      agenda?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Given the expertise of
      CWTS on S&T indicators and research assessment, our Chair aims to provide evidence
      to raise awareness on existing problems in diversity and inclusion in world
      science. We will work mainly along two complementary lines.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><strong>First, developing monitoring methods</strong> that illuminate
      progress in the adoption of the 2017 <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers</a>,
      and the recent <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recommendation on Open Science</a>, with a focus on making
      knowledge more accessible, representative and participatory. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      monitoring methods for these recommendations are not straightforward at all
      because they are related to values and need contextualisation. We have to go
      beyond existing statistical methods. To do so, we will build on expertise developed
      in projects for monitoring <em>Responsible Research and Innovation</em>, in
      particular <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">SuperMoRRI.</a></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Second,</strong><strong>developing</strong><strong>a multi-perspective
      observatory of global scholarly communication</strong> (let\u2019s call it a
      <strong><em>Multiversatory</em></strong>!), focusing on making visible outputs
      and activities of the global academic community which are currently invisible.
      A classical example is the exclusion of national and local scientific journals
      from mainstream scientometric databases. So far, the global research landscape
      has been mapped using selective commercial databases which miss a large share
      of all scientific publications, particularly from journals in the social sciences
      and humanities and from the Global South.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">However,
      more comprehensive open databases such as <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>
      are becoming increasingly available. These databases provide a more inclusive
      (though still incomplete) coverage for the Global South and also allows comparison
      of how visibility differs depending on perspectives. We believe that with these
      new databases a step change will be soon made in the analysis of the geography
      of scholarly communication. We expect to show that <a href=\"https://preprints.scielo.org/index.php/scielo/preprint/view/4729/version/5022\"
      target=\"_blank\">world science is actually more diverse than is frequently
      believed</a>, but that many parts of the knowledge created often remain invisible.<br></p>\n\n

      this blogpost, the authors critically discuss their experience as guest editors
      for a Frontiers journal. They aim to foster open scholarly debate about Frontiers
      publishing practices, triggered by Frontiers hindering such debate on their
      own pages.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      idea for this blog post emerged in the context of a special issue with the online
      journal <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics</em></a>.
      We, a group of researchers that can broadly be associated with science & technology
      studies and meta-research, were invited by Frontiers to guest edit what they
      call a \u2018Research Topic\u2019, suggesting it could focus on innovations
      in peer review practices. We accepted the invitation, and subsequently launched
      a call for contributions around the topic of \u201CChange and Innovation in
      Manuscript Peer Review\u201D. The resulting <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/17324/change-and-innovation-in-manuscript-peer-review-the-effects-on-the-research-process\"
      target=\"_blank\">collection</a> appeared in January 2022 and contains six articles
      we are very proud of. They touch on such topics as the specificities of peer
      review in law journals, the changing role of (guest) editors amidst increased
      use of editorial management systems, and mechanisms and labels to assure quality
      in book publishing.</p><p>We were aware of previous criticism of Frontiers\u2019
      approach to scholarly publishing (see for instance <a href=\"https://forbetterscience.com/2015/10/28/is-frontiers-a-potential-predatory-publisher/\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaraMather/status/1581300436836921344\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> for a recent example) and intensively discussed whether
      we should embark on this project. We came to the conclusion that the topic is
      important and timely, especially in the context of a journal that itself represents
      (and pushes) new peer review and editorial practices. That said, working with
      Frontiers forced us to develop a form of reflexivity about our own publishing
      process we would have rather liked to do without. More specifically, we aimed
      to publish our reflections on the editorial practices we encountered during
      our editorship as part of the introduction to the Research Topic, but Frontiers
      did not allow us to. After more than half a year of discussions - and particularly
      long periods of silence from Frontiers - we decided to publish our editorial
      as a <a href=\"https://osf.io/ksg6q\" target=\"_blank\">preprint</a> and write
      this blog post to inform the scientific community about our experiences.</p><h3>Concerns
      about the editorial process</h3><p>Our worries began with the organisation of
      the peer review process itself. Frontiers forces users into a relatively rigid
      workflow that foresees contacting a large number of potential reviewers for
      submissions. Reviewers are selected by an internal artificial intelligence algorithm
      on the basis of keywords automatically attributed by the algorithm based on
      the content of the submitted manuscript and matched with a database of potential
      reviewers, a technique somewhat similar to the one used for reviewer databases
      of other big publishers. While the importance of the keywords for the match
      can be manually adjusted, the fit between submissions and the actually required
      domain expertise to review them is often less than perfect. This would not be
      a problem were the process of contacting reviewers fully under the control of
      the editors. Yet the numerous potential reviewers are contacted by means of
      a preformulated email in a quasi-automated fashion, apparently under the assumption
      that many of them will reject anyway. We find this to be problematic because
      it ultimately erodes the willingness of academics to donate their time for unpaid
      but absolutely vital community service. In addition, in some cases it resulted
      in reviewers being assigned to papers in our Research Topic that we believed
      were not qualified to perform reviews. Significant amounts of emailing and back-and-forth
      with managing editors and Frontiers staff were required to bypass this system,
      retract review invitations and instead focus only on the reviewers we actually
      wanted to contact. As it turns out, the editorial management system is so rigidly
      set up, that even Frontiers\u2019 own staff does not always have the ability
      to adjust key settings. </p><p>Another concern we had is the pacing of the review
      and publication process. Frontiers aims to avoid unnecessary delays in the reviewing
      of submissions, a goal we wholeheartedly subscribe to. Yet the intended workflow
      is such that reviewers have only seven days to complete their reports as a default,
      with the possibility to extend the deadline to twenty-one days - however, again
      at the cost of a cumbersome process of emailing with Frontiers staff. Also,
      automatically generated review invitations as described above are sent out if
      the editors do not send out sufficiently many review invitations themselves
      within three days, including weekends, holidays and (as was the case with us)
      summer breaks. While we see how short deadlines can contribute to fast dissemination,
      we feel that the current standards might jeopardize the quality of the review
      process.</p><p>A third element of the rigidly organised review process we found
      to be a mixed blessing concerns the level of editorial control that editors
      maintain.&nbsp;In fact, editors are encouraged to&nbsp;accept manuscripts as
      soon as they receive two recommendations&nbsp;for publication by reviewers (regardless
      of how many other reviewers recommend rejection). This holds for all review
      rounds. Especially in combination with the factors mentioned above, i.e. potentially
      unqualified reviewers being invited and high requirements on review speed, this
      potentially creates additional challenges to the quality of the editorial process.</p><h3>Hindered
      to voice reflections</h3><p>As referred to before, a learning experience of
      a questionable sort was our attempt to publish an editorial that reflected on
      these issues. We naturally intended to include our editorial in the very special
      issue we edited. However, upon submission of our draft we received a message
      informing us that our text was not in accordance with the guidelines of Frontiers.
      They insisted that the text could not be published unless we took out the two
      paragraphs of rather critical reflections on Frontiers\u2019 editorial process.
      We insisted that these reflections were an essential element of our editorial
      and closely related to the content of our Research Topic, which dealt with the
      impact of editorial processes on knowledge production and dissemination. In
      addition, we felt that being forced to erase the reflections drastically impacted
      on our editorial freedom. This then led to several emails back and forth, among
      others including Frontiers\u2019 head of research integrity and various in-house
      editorial staff members. When the issue could not be resolved through correspondence,
      we ultimately scheduled a zoom call with Frontiers\u2019 Chief Executive Editor
      (CEE). We once again explained our stance regarding the appropriateness of reflecting
      on our editorial process in our editorial. </p><p>In our meeting, the CEE confirmed
      that such a reflective element was appropriate and that Frontiers was of course
      \u2018very willing to listen to our feedback\u2019. However, he felt that an
      editorial was not the right place to voice such reflections. There were concerns
      about \u201Cour editorial lacking context\u201D. Apparently, the issues we identified
      were specific to our own process and were in no way indicative of Frontiers\u2019
      general practices. We have reasons to doubt the veracity of this claim. </p><p>Subsequently,
      we were promised that the CEE would come up with a suggested solution to the
      situation in the week following our call. After four months and six reminders,
      we have still not heard back from Frontiers. That is why we decided to publish
      our editorial as a preprint (in line with Frontiers\u2019 own preprint policies)
      and publish this blog post to inform the scientific community about our process.
      We informed the Frontiers staff about the publication of the preprint and this
      blog post in advance, but once again without response from their side.</p><h3>Towards
      open scholarly debate</h3><p>By writing this blog, we aim to share our experiences
      as guest editors at Frontiers, contributing to the ongoing debate about changing
      publishing and editorial models. We are generally in favour of improving and
      innovating editorial and peer review processes and find several elements of
      Frontiers\u2019 editorial model interesting, including the Open Identities and
      Open Reports formats of review, and creating a forum for authors, reviewers
      and editors to interact. However, we have concerns about other elements, believing
      that they affect the quality and integrity of the process and published record.
      We believe that openness about our experiences is important to support stakeholders
      in making informed decisions about how, where and with whom to engage in the
      publishing process. We much regret Frontiers\u2019 attempts to hinder an open
      discussion about these aspects. Despite our reflections not being part of the
      Research Topic, where we still feel they would have fitted best, we hope our
      editorial/preprint and this blog post can trigger the open scholarly debate
      we believe to be essential.<br></p><span class=\"caption\"><br>Header image:

      this post Ludo Waltman and Bianca Kramer reflect on today\u2019s announcement
      that Wiley is joining the Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA) and is going
      to make abstracts openly available through Crossref.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3>Why is it important that
      abstracts are made openly available?</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/a-academic-librarians-thoughts-on-open-access/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs-bb7bde1ed751\"
      target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that we published two years ago together with
      our colleague Aaron Tay, we discussed numerous ways in which open abstracts
      can be of great value. This includes scientific literature search, both using
      traditional query-based search tools and using more advanced text mining and
      visualization tools. It also includes the analysis of the structure and dynamics
      of research fields using bibliometric visualization tools such as <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer</a> and <a href=\"http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CiteSpace</a>. In addition, we pointed out that open abstracts
      can be used to support systematic literature reviewing, to algorithmically identify
      relations between scholarly outputs, to assign these outputs to research topics
      or research fields, and to enable automatic knowledge extraction, for instance
      by algorithmically identifying biomedical entities and gene-disease associations.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Publishers typically make abstracts freely available on their websites.
      However, to support the above use cases, it is essential that abstracts are
      openly available in a centralized infrastructure. For publishers that work with
      <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> to register
      DOIs for their content, the <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Initiative
      for Open Abstracts (I4OA)</a> recommends making abstracts openly available through
      Crossref.<br></p><h3>Many other publishers have already opened their abstracts.
      What is the significance of the step taken by Wiley?</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed
      many publishers have already opened their abstracts, and of these publishers
      100 are also <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#publishers\" target=\"_blank\">formal
      supporters of I4OA</a>. This includes Hindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE, three
      of the <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#founders\" target=\"_blank\">founding organizations
      of I4OA</a>. Abstracts are currently openly available for 39% of the journal
      articles in Crossref in the period 2020-2022. Until today, however, of the world\u2019s
      five largest publishers, in terms of number of journal articles, MDPI was the
      only one supporting I4OA. Of these five publishers, <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/network/researchers/open-research/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research\"
      target=\"_blank\">Wiley is now the second one joining I4OA</a>. It follows the
      example of Hindawi, which was acquired by Wiley last year. Given that Wiley
      published 6% of the journal articles in Crossref in the period 2020-2022, we
      see Wiley\u2019s support for I4OA as an important milestone for openness of
      abstracts.<br></p><h3>What do you expect other large publishers will do?</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">With support for I4OA from the world\u2019s third (Wiley) and fourth
      (MDPI) largest publisher, we do not see any credible argument for other large
      publishers, in particular Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Taylor & Francis, to
      withhold their support for open abstracts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Springer Nature
      is under pressure from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02915-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">editors of its flagship journal <em>Nature</em></a> to support
      open abstracts. It is already making abstracts openly available through Crossref
      for its open access content, but unlike Wiley and other publishers supporting
      I4OA, its policy is not to make abstracts openly available for its subscription
      content. Extending its support for open abstracts to all its content seems a
      natural next step for Springer Nature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While it may take a
      bit more time, we expect that Taylor & Francis and Elsevier will follow as well.
      Taylor & Francis has a daughter company, F1000, that was one of the <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/press.html#pressrelease\"
      target=\"_blank\">initial supporters of I4OA</a>. We do not see any reason for
      Taylor & Francis not to follow the example of its daughter company.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      an apparent attempt to protect its Scopus business, Elsevier initially declined
      to open its citations, despite <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/14/elsevier-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal\"
      target=\"_blank\">strong protest from the scientometric community</a>. However,
      in 2020, Elsevier changed its position and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/q-a-about-elseviers-decision-to-open-its-citation\"
      target=\"_blank\">joined the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a>. Of the
      larger publishers, Elsevier was one of the last ones to open its citations.
      To prevent this history from repeating itself, we are hopeful that Elsevier
      will act more swiftly in opening its abstracts.<br></p><h3>How does the step
      taken by Wiley fit into the bigger picture of openness of metadata of scholarly
      outputs?</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">While openness of abstracts and citations is of
      critical importance, it is of limited value if other metadata is not made openly
      available as well. This for instance includes affiliation and funding metadata,
      license information, and links between scholarly outputs, such as links between
      preprints and the corresponding journal articles or between journal articles
      and the associated data sets. This metadata should as much as possible make
      use of openly-governed persistent identifiers, for instance <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a> and <a href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROR</a>
      identifiers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As can be seen in the figure below, in recent
      years publishers have made significant progress in making metadata of journal
      articles openly available through Crossref. More detailed statistics reported
      in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5\" target=\"_blank\">this
      preprint</a> show that Wiley is doing a good job by making affiliation metadata
      openly available. Other large publishers, such as Elsevier, Springer Nature,
      and MDPI, have not yet taken this step. Like many publishers, Wiley is also
      making funding metadata openly available. However, as shown in recent analyses
      (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>
      and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>),
      for many publishers the funding metadata made available through Crossref suffers
      from gaps and other quality issues.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/QA-about-Wiley\u2019s-decision-to-open-its-abstracts_image1.png\"
      data-image=\"29565\" alt=\"rcentage of journal articles with open metadata in
      Crossref.\"></figure><p><span dir=\"ltr\" class=\"caption\">Percentage of journal
      articles with open metadata in Crossref. Source: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5\"
      target=\"_blank\">Van Eck & Waltman (2022, Figure 2)</a>.<br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      some cases, metadata that is not made available through Crossref can be obtained
      from other open data sources, such as <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>.
      OpenAlex collects affiliation metadata from publisher websites and makes this
      metadata openly available. As shown in a <a href=\"https://github.com/Curtin-Open-Knowledge-Initiative/open-metadata-report/blob/main/reports/run_20221008_1/report_template_singleDB.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent analysis</a> performed by one of us, OpenAlex is able
      to provide affiliation metadata for publishers that do not deposit this metadata
      to Crossref. However, this metadata has not been \u2018authorized\u2019 by publishers
      and may suffer from inaccuracies due to technical challenges in the algorithmic
      extraction of metadata from publisher websites.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Similarly,
      OpenAlex is able to provide abstracts for 75-80% of the recent journal articles
      in Crossref, partly by scraping abstracts from publisher websites, which might
      cause accuracy issues. These abstracts are made available in an \u2018inverted
      format\u2019 (i.e., as a list of individual words with location indicators)
      for copyright reasons, which is somewhat cumbersome and potentially less sustainable
      than having abstracts made available by publishers in their Crossref metadata.</p><h3>How
      can researchers and other actors in the research community contribute to openness
      of abstracts and other metadata?</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Realizing openness of abstracts
      and other metadata requires significant efforts by publishers and their technology
      providers, and also by the team of Crossref. Other actors in the research community
      can contribute as well, in particular by showing the value they attach to open
      metadata.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Researchers can contribute by taking openness of
      metadata, including abstracts, into account when choosing the journal to which
      they submit their work. Openness of metadata will reduce the dependency on proprietary
      platforms such as Scopus and Web of Science for discovery of research and assessment
      of researchers. Crossref provides <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Participation Reports</a> that researchers can use to get
      a quick overview of the metadata that a publisher makes openly available through
      Crossref.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Research funders can make a contribution by including
      openness of metadata as a requirement in their open access policies. This is
      for instance already done in <a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/technical-guidance_and_requirements/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Plan S</a>. Likewise, research institutions and their libraries
      can contribute by including openness of metadata in their negotiations with
      publishers, as suggested by the <a href=\"https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2020/09/24/tib-supports-initiative-for-open-abstracts-i4oa/\"
      target=\"_blank\">TIB library</a>, one of the more than 60 <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#stakeholders\"
      target=\"_blank\">stakeholders supporting I4OA</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you
      would like to contribute to openness of abstracts, the I4OA team is happy to
      help. Feel free to reach out, either on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/open_abstracts\"

      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/supermorri_logo.png\" data-image=\"28789\"></figure><p>In
      2014, CWTS got involved in the <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/\"
      target=\"_blank\">MoRRI project</a> funded by the European Commission (EC) to
      follow up on their new policy of Responsible Research and Innovation (2013).
      In the policy context, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000930\"
      target=\"_blank\">concept of Responsibility is attributed to anticipatory, reflexive,
      responsive, and inclusive attitudes in research and innovation processes</a>
      and was operationalized in six key principles: gender equality, public engagement,
      ethics, open access, science literacy and science education, and governance.
      MoRRI followed the key principles of the EC, building upon earlier indicators,
      and developing new ones, on a national level. Data collection across Europe
      on the actual situation was hampered by the low number of responses, and it
      was felt that such an approach didn\u2019t do justice to the diversity in policy,
      geographical and organisational aspects. This was all taken up by the MoRRI
      successor, <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">SUPER MoRRI</a>.<br></p><p>SUPER
      MoRRI is one of the EC flagship projects that brings together the EC policies
      on Responsible Research and Innovation, funded through the H2020 Science with
      and for Society (SwafS) program. It does so in different ways: continuing the
      MoRRI train through a significant data collection exercise, doing broad conceptual
      work through in-depth case studies, and connecting with European and global
      partners. But first, the <a href=\"(hyperlink: https://super-morri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">consortium</a>
      felt that they should take the time and go back to the drawing table to reflect
      on several aspects.<br></p><h3>Reflections on what monitoring and evaluation
      of RRI is</h3><p>In the first <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/from-morri-to-super_morri-monitoring-as-reflection-and-learning-not-representation-and-control/\"
      target=\"_blank\">blogpost</a>&nbsp;of the SUPER&nbsp;MoRRI series, Wouter van
      der Klippe discusses the transition from MoRRI to the new SUPER MoRRI project.
      When we stop focusing on the outcomes of measurements and their accuracy and
      instead consider the possibilities that monitoring provides, evaluation is set
      free from producing indicators. Instead, evaluation can be an opportunity to
      create a space for articulating what is valued and why. Thus, SUPER&nbsp;MoRRI
      is creating a transformative opportunity that may better equip us to develop
      more open potential RRI-enriched futures, as diverse and inclusive as were initially
      hoped for.</p><figure style=\"float:left; margin:60px 40px 70px 20px;\"><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/supermorri_rollup.png\"
      data-image=\"28808\"></figure><p>But when we talk about monitoring RRI, is there
      a consensus on the purpose or even the content of RRI?&nbsp;Roger Strand <a
      href=\"https://super-morri.eu/3-policy-narratives-for-rri/\" target=\"_blank\">distinguishes
      between three policy narratives for RRI</a>&nbsp;in his blogpost.&nbsp;They
      are portrayed in a slightly caricatured way and exaggerate the differences.
      The first policy narrative is: \u201CHow do we regain control over the runaway
      train of science and technology before it totally destroys our world?\u201D
      Some hope that RRI will enable society to speak back to science and help shape
      research agendas and ultimately research trajectories so that they will lead
      to outputs and outcomes that are beneficial to people and the planet. The second,
      opposite narrative is: \u201CHow do we educate, reassure and calm down the ungrateful
      public and make them trust us, trust science again?\u201D RRI, and especially
      the so-called RRI \u201Ckeys\u201D of the EC are better fit for the purpose
      of providing accountability and legitimacy to calm down the citizens and argue
      that everything is in order. The third policy narrative sees the world of science,
      technology, and society as a set of entangled networks that are increasingly
      in need of mutual collaboration and communication. Here RRI is seen as a way
      to improve collaboration across silos and promote thinking outside of the box.
      Therefore, it is important to be aware of such plurality of desires for RRI
      when working for SUPER MORRI.</p><p><a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/where-are-the-people-in-innovation-monitoring/\"
      target=\"_blank\">In the third reflection</a>,&nbsp;Paula Otero Hermida describes
      the difference between monitoring science and monitoring innovation. In science,
      there is a wide set of indicators and periodic monitoring efforts on e.g. gender
      aspects. As the main reference, there are the <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1\"
      target=\"_blank\">She Figures reports</a> (European Commission) as well as indicators
      in the main RRI monitoring initiatives at the European level. However, when
      looking at the monitoring of innovation, it seems that the current paradigm
      ignores who (and in which conditions) innovates, but rather focuses on the firm\u2019s
      environment and systemic variables.  It is hence important to realise which
      data are <em>not</em> available: there are no data on the human factor in the
      innovation surveys. That means we can find data regarding innovation\u2019s
      investment and firms, but there are&nbsp;limited data available on the sociodemographic
      traits, labor conditions, or other factors regarding the actors that are innovating
      themselves. Therefore, there are no data on gender in the case of the OECD,
      EUROSTAT nor in the innovation survey carried out by the Spanish National Institute
      of Statistics. When data is not collected or available, it is important to be
      aware of gender and other diversity aspects, and include it in the monitoring
      framework to make it explicit.<br></p><h3>SUPER MoRRI\u2019s principles</h3><p>When
      we do monitoring and evaluation of RRI, we would like ourselves to be responsible
      too! That is reflected in the strategic plan that emerged from the internal
      conversations. Richard Woolley describes our principles <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/the-super-morri-strategic-plan/\"
      target=\"_blank\">in the SUPER MoRRI strategic plan</a>.&nbsp;The consortium\u2019s
      conceptual view on RRI takes&nbsp;engagement among diverse constellations of
      actors as the key driver of enhanced responsibility in both research and innovation
      and would increase consideration of relevant environmental and societal uncertainties.
      The monitoring framework will provide interested stakeholders with resources
      that can help them to plan and progress toward more responsible practices and
      strategies. This will be done on the basis of a \u2018<em>responsible quantification</em>\u2019
      approach in which data and information are presented, and made interpretable,
      in appropriate ways. A related conceptual innovation is what we call \u2018<em>credible
      contextualisation\u2019</em>. This is the idea that any indicators we develop
      should, first, pass through a co-creation phase with potential users, and second,
      be accompanied by guidance on the degree of interpretive \u2018stickiness\u2019
      of the indicator. </p><p>Three years into the project, the two principles still
      stand and are applied <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/responsible-approach-to-monitoring-rri/\"
      target=\"_blank\">as further elaborated by Richard Woolley</a>&nbsp;in a blogpost.
      Transforming these principles into a framework presenting SUPER MoRRI indicators
      in three components: an indicator fiche; a description of potential interpretive
      models; and complementary information to support user understanding and interpretation
      of the indicator. In the case of new RRI indicators, the interpretive model
      will explain the rationale for the creation of the indicator and how it is perceived
      to support RRI. For indicators that are time-series \u2013 or have the potential
      for future replication to create time-series \u2013 the model describes what
      a change in the indicator can be reasonably understood to mean. Further information
      is provided to try and ensure the credible contextualisation of the indicator.
      Involving users in the development phase of the indicator also helps to guide
      the design and production of these supporting elements as work progresses.<br></p><h3>Putting
      the monitoring framework into practice</h3><p>How to operationalize then the
      data collection in a responsible way? Moving away from surveys and analysis
      at the country level, instead, we focus on the organisational level. <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/what-are-country-correspondents/\"
      target=\"_blank\">In a blog post</a>,&nbsp;Massimo Graae Losinno explains how
      SUPER MoRRI has engaged a <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/country-correspondent-network/\"
      target=\"_blank\">panel of Country Correspondents</a>. The monitoring activities
      cover all EU countries, Norway, and the UK. For each of these 29 countries,
      a Country Correspondent contributed to data collection and reporting. Country
      Correspondents were chosen on the basis of their expertise in social science
      methods, their knowledge of the national research and innovation system in their
      country of residence, and their familiarity with RRI and monitoring. The Country
      Correspondents are responsible for conducting interviews and document analyses
      in relation to studies examining 55 Research Funding Organisations (RFOs, 2
      per country) and 142 Research Performing Organisations (RPOs, 4-8 per country)
      in their respective countries. With this approach we build upon local knowledge
      and qualitative methods across diverse political, cultural, and social settings,
      as well as diverse research and innovation environments.</p><p>The substantial
      qualitative data collection effort of the Country Correspondents is complemented
      by the repeated collection of secondary data that were presented in MoRRI as
      well, and hence provide timeseries. In <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/findings/\"
      target=\"_blank\">the first monitoring report </a>(i.e.&nbsp;D2.2),&nbsp;secondary
      data on R&I expenditure, patent applications, labour market participation (gender
      equality), bibliometric data on open access, and Eurobarometer data are presented
      in a responsible way. The second and third monitoring reports are available
      shortly from the SUPER MoRRI website. Here the results of the RFO and RPO studies
      are included, which provide for the first time extensive organizational level
      data.</p><p>From the beginning, SUPER MoRRI aimed to create impact by connecting
      to other funded SwafS-projects on RRI-related topics. And the wish from the
      EC to take a global perspective on responsibility too, has been implemented
      through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/global-satellite-partners/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Global Satellite partners</a> and the annual events we organized.
      This will be described in the second blog post on SUPER MoRRI\u2019s European
      ecosystem and global network. <br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ingeborg

      happens when you bring together the CWTS team and let them dream into the blue?

      Participatory Activists Network or the enigmatic GRRASS: nothing was unthinkable.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p
      dir=\"ltr\">At CWTS we are currently working on the development of our <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">new knowledge agenda</a>, a strategic plan for our center
      for the next six years. As part of this process, we are having lots of discussions,
      both internally within our center and with external colleagues and experts.
      While it will still take a few more months before we can share the outcomes
      of this process, we can already provide some impressions of the types of ideas
      we are discussing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On September 15 and 16, the CWTS team got
      together in a hotel in Leiden for a two-day retreat. On the first day, we discussed
      the preliminary plans for our new knowledge agenda with a number of external
      experts, who offered very useful feedback and helped us broaden our horizon.
      On the second day, we challenged ourselves to think big and to develop \u2018dream
      projects\u2019 that CWTS could work on in the coming years. We formed five groups,
      each consisting of five or six CWTS colleagues, and each group spent a few hours
      developing a dream project.</p><h3><strong>Dream projects</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">One
      group proposed to set up a <em>Global Responsible Research Assessment Support
      Station</em> (<em>GRRASS</em>). The ambition of GRRASS is to bring together
      all stakeholders worldwide interested in making research assessment more responsible.
      GRRASS would consist of a global network of satellite organizations on each
      continent, each helping to mediate between regional and global level activities
      and issues. Together, these sites would aim to develop standards for responsible
      research assessment and organize accreditation in which the compliance of institutions
      with these standards is evaluated.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture1.jpg\"
      data-image=\"29085\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Another group proposed the <em>New Society-Science Collaboration</em>.
      This proposal builds on partnerships that CWTS has established in different
      parts of the world, through existing initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\">SUPER MoRRI project</a>. Supported by Unesco, the created
      network would be used to develop projects in a co-creative way, meaning needs-driven,
      with awareness of diversity and equality aspects. That would include partners
      that are, for instance, geographically diverse, but also originating from all
      helices of the quadruple helix: academia, policy, industry and citizens. The
      objective is to expand and foster the network through activities. In mixed methods,
      where the non-digital contexts prevail, CWTS could bring in new digital methods
      including <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cocreating-science-that-society-needs-introducing-the-explore-approach\"
      target=\"_blank\">diverse data sources and advanced mapping approaches</a>.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture2_2022-10-17-164357_twlc.jpg\"
      data-image=\"29056\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">A related idea was developed by one of the other groups. This group
      proposed to set up a <em>Participatory Activists Network</em>. This network
      would focus on helping bring together activists who are pushing for change in
      the science system but who are not formally involved in decision making in scientific
      organizations. Contributions by CWTS would initially be situated with specific
      actors in the network (e.g., around evaluation), but eventually our participation
      would be present across the network, working closely with a variety of activists.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture3.jpg\" data-image=\"29022\"
      style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another
      dream project aimed to eradicate scientific misinformation from societal debates.
      Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the project would
      systematically map interactions between science and society. By making science-society
      dynamics visible and comprehensible, the project envisions to empower academic
      and societal stakeholders to mitigate misinformation and renew trust in science.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture4.jpg\" data-image=\"28992\"
      style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The final
      dream project is the <em>Open Comprehensive European University Research Information
      System</em> (<em>OCEURIS</em>), an open CRIS system for all European universities
      that will contain information deemed necessary by many institutions to realize
      the ambition of making their research assessment processes more responsible.
      The aim is that in the next five years at least half of the European universities
      will join OCEURIS.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture5.jpg\"
      data-image=\"28972\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>Employee
      of the Year Award</strong></h3><p>Besides dreaming about future projects, we
      also used the opportunity of being together at our retreat to celebrate some
      of the work currently being done at our center. Each year an <em>Employee of
      the Year Award</em> is handed out to a CWTS colleague who deserves special recognition.
      This year the award turned out to be a little bit different than in earlier
      years. To acknowledge the importance of teamwork at CWTS, Ingeborg Meijer, last
      year\u2019s awardee, decided to hand out the award not to an individual colleague
      but to a team. The award was given to the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\">A-TEAM</a>, which performs a crucial task at CWTS by performing
      high-quality curation of the data in our bibliographic database system. Congratulations
      to all members of the team for this well-deserved award. Thank you for taking
      such good care of our data!</p><h3><strong>What\u2019s next</strong></h3><p>Have
      we just been dreaming at our retreat, or are we actually going to make our dreams
      come true? We believe the process of developing dream projects is valuable in
      itself, even if ultimately a project is not going to be realized. Developing
      dream projects stimulated us to think in less conventional ways than we normally
      do and to find out what we are truly passionate about. Time will tell whether
      we will manage to find ways to make our dreams come true. Stay tuned for further
      updates on the development of our new knowledge agenda!</p><p><em>We are grateful
      to our CWTS colleagues for sharing their dreams and contributing to this blog

      can local knowledge production help regions to create more sustainable and inclusive
      societies? This post will delve deeper in how we combined the core concepts
      of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and smart specialisation and how
      this developed into the EXPLORE methodology.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>The EXPLORE methodology was
      developed in the context of the two territorial RRI projects CHERRIES and RIPEET
      (H2020) that CWTS is participating in since 2020. It can assist territories
      in developing more innovative, inclusive, and self-sustaining R&I ecosystems
      by ensuring bottom-up involvement of all kinds of local stakeholders and citizens.
      This blogpost follows up on the first <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cherries-and-ripeet-cwts-traveling-the-science-society-interface?token=ew9UXNynLGIZAFaGNw53I96lA0f3qKPm\"
      target=\"_blank\">RIPEET CHERRIES blogpost</a> that explains what these projects
      are about and what CWTS has learned from working at the science-society interface.<br></p><h3>RRI
      & SMART Specialisation</h3><p>The core concept in both projects is <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346632810_Monitoring_Responsible_Research_and_Innovation_in_the_European_research_area\"
      target=\"_blank\">RRI</a>. This policy approach anticipates and assesses potential
      implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation,
      with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and
      innovation. It implies that societal actors (researchers, citizens, policy makers,
      business, third sector organisations, etc.) work together during the whole research
      and innovation process in order to better align both the process and its outcomes
      with the values, needs and expectations of society. In practice, RRI is implemented
      as a package that includes multi-actor and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/node/766\"
      target=\"_blank\">public engagement in research and innovation</a>. RRI thus
      enables easier access to scientific results, the take up of gender equality
      and ethics in the research and innovation content and processes, and formal
      and informal science education. RRI actions such as fostering co-creation and
      demand driven R&I in an open and responsible way can be a complex matter due
      to the plurality of actors involved and the socio-cultural divergences between
      the different geographical areas in Europe. However, it can also be a great
      opportunity for growth if it is done effectively. However, neither the theory,
      policy nor practice of RRI pays attention to the spatial dimension of research
      and innovation processes. As a consequence, RRI practices often ignore the various
      ways in which regional context affects not only the development of innovation
      but also the perception of what is responsible and socially desirable.</p><p>\u2018<a
      href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814\"
      target=\"_blank\">Smart Specialisation</a>\u2019 is an innovation policy concept
      intended to promote the efficient and effective use of public investment in
      research. Its goal is to boost regional (territorial) science and innovation
      in order to achieve economic growth and prosperity, by enabling regions to pursue
      new developments by making use of their local strengths. It has been gaining
      importance for innovation policy because of the role of proximity and the presence
      of knowledge-related institutions in associated fields are thought to have a
      positive influence. Thereby, the smart specialisation strategy (<a href=\"https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home\"
      target=\"_blank\">RIS3</a>) programme is the most ambitious and endowed approach
      of EU-funded territorial innovation policies so far. However, the potential
      implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation
      have often been ignored in the smart specialisation discourse and the entrepreneurial
      development process that should support S3.</p><p>The European Commission recently
      launched the new smart specialisation policy framework; S4. S4 specifically
      focuses on sustainable innovation, which aims at demand driven social innovation
      that should bring long lasting systemic changes and green innovation to the
      European regions. This requires not only a well-designed priority portfolio
      tailored to the region, but also active participation from regional actors and
      a regional learning process. The concept of regional participation, experimentation
      and initiatives to achieve desired social transformative change originates from
      the third frame of innovation policy, regarded in literature as the most recent
      paradigm in which to view innovation policy (distinguished from two earlier
      framings related to R&D and national systems of innovation). These social transformations
      that S4 targets are often very complex with many stakeholders involved, take
      place on different levels of society and are of systemic nature. Therefore,
      S4 calls for a directional systemic approach in which a diverse set of local
      actors determine the directions to take collectively. To support regions in
      this process, methodologies, tools and workshop formats have to be developed
      to guide regions in for instance stakeholder engagement, regional mapping, target
      setting, working backwards from goals, and reflection and evaluation. The European
      Commission is working on the S4 Playbook in which these type of approaches are
      collected to assist the regions here. Although a helpful support, regions will
      likely differ a lot in their nature, needs and questions, which means that often
      a case to case assessment is required.    </p><h3>RRI X SMART SPEC (S4)</h3><p>It
      is especially in S4 that smart specialisation and RRI can be well aligned, given
      that both concepts address demand driven, social and inclusive developments
      in a participatory process involving regional actors. Combining the two concepts
      has the potential to better align research with local societal demands and to
      bring new research insights to society more effectively. This combination is
      a new one that <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">CWTS</a> has
      implemented in both <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/cherries\"
      target=\"_blank\">CHERRIES</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/ripeet\"
      target=\"_blank\">RIPEET</a> by conducting a mixed method approach. On the one
      hand regional data was collected on scientific output, technological development,
      actors and policy programs. On the other hand regional discussion groups were
      organised in which all types of regional actors could voice their innovation
      needs and ideas as well as comment upon the collected regional data. This was
      very much an iterative process in which we went back and forth between the data
      and regional actors multiple time. Nevertheless, in the end we ended up with
      a comprehensive overview of the regional innovation ecosystem of which the data
      was screened by regional actors and in which the societal needs voiced by the
      regional actors could be evaluated by the regional data.</p><h3>Expertise at&nbsp;CWTS</h3><p><a
      href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects\" target=\"_blank\">CWTS</a>
      is very well positioned to conduct this type of analysis, as it had expertise
      in multiple related areas. In the first place CWTS is a mixed method institute
      with both quantitative and qualitative expertise, which fits this type of analysis
      well. It also has been involved in many related projects focusing on topics
      like the sustainable development goals (<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/strings\"
      target=\"_blank\">STRINGS</a>), participatory processes (Knowledge Ecosystems),
      scientific and technological data analysis (<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/risis\"
      target=\"_blank\">RISIS</a>), innovation dynamics (<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/newhorrizon\"
      target=\"_blank\">H2020 projects</a>) and development of a monitoring framework
      for responsible R&I practices (<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/supermorri\"
      target=\"_blank\">SUPER MoRRI</a>). An approach that combines these elements
      enables CWTS to put its knowledge and expertise in practice and support transitions
      that benefit society. Moreover, participating in such projects helps to align
      \ the research conducted at the institute with present-day questions that arise
      in societal, scientific and policy communities.</p><h3>EXPLORE</h3><p>In order
      to facilitate local knowledge production and experimentation that help regions
      to create more sustainable and inclusive societies, CWTS recently launched the
      EXPLORE (EX(ploring) P(articipatory) L(ocal) O(pen) responsible  R(&I) E(cosystems)
      methodology. As the acronym suggests, it combines the fundamental building blocks
      \ of RRI and S4 into an accessible R&I approach. We do this by integrating heterogeneous
      elements like group workshops, process evaluation and territorial mapping under
      the same methodological umbrella in a modular format. This modular format enables
      us to select the specific elements that a given territorial societal demand
      requires, thus making the approach very flexible to any kind of territory or
      challenge. Moreover, this approach helps to avoid the \u201Cone policy fits
      all\u201D pitfall by enabling a bottom-up approach and taking the region specific
      situation as the starting point of each assessment. The EXPLORE methodology
      enables CWTS to be more involved in local and regional experimentation and innovation,
      the co-creation of new priority targets and policy mixes, the <a href=\"https://repository.fteval.at/604/\"
      target=\"_blank\">monitoring and evaluation</a> of these processes, and social
      transformative change in general. </p><h3>What includes EXPLORE</h3><p>The modular
      building blocks in EXPLORE can be stored under three main important innovation
      processes: Mapping, priority setting & <a href=\"https://repository.fteval.at/603/\"
      target=\"_blank\">transition process</a> and monitoring & evaluation (M&E).</p><p>Firstly,
      EXPLORE can help territories to get an overview of their R&I landscape by offering
      different <strong>mapping</strong> analyses. This is an important understanding
      for governments and societal actors alike, because it provides the basis from
      which new plans, strategies, experiments and innovation in general can be developed.
      Among these analyses are for instance stakeholder discussion sessions that identify
      barriers and opportunities in the R&I system together with the local actors.
      Also the policy landscape can be analysed to identify what opportunities for
      experimentation already exist and where gaps may be found that should be addressed.
      Lastly, EXPLORE also offers extensive data analysis of the regional knowledge
      landscape based on publication and patent output with visualisations that show
      in a glance where the relative capabilities of the territory are located in
      a given innovation field.  One such approach is the Science Landscape, as shown
      below for the energy field in Extremadura. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Extremadura-energy-map-720.png\"
      data-image=\"28368\"></figure><p><br>Secondly, EXPLORE can also assist in <strong>priority
      setting</strong> and in the <strong>transition process</strong>\r\nitself. The
      included tools help government and local actors to make difficult choices, approach
      complex challenges outside their usual scope and initiate experimentation. It
      can provide hints for prioritisation compliant to the smart specialisation rationale
      based on local knowledge data analysis that should then be combined with local
      actor input. It provides further assistance tools by a wide variety of workshop
      options to get closer to the desired priorities and outcomes. Among these are
      for instance workshops that structure the local needs present, visioning workshops
      that constitute a vision of what could be achieved and backcasting exercises
      that work out how to get to a desired future. In all these workshops participants
      are challenged to keep an open mind, local actors are heavily involved and exercises
      are flexible to adhere to the local context.   </p><figure style=\"width:100%;

      style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"><span class=\"caption\"><em>CHERRIES
      Policy Labs session in Brussels (May 2022)<br></em></span></p><p>Lastly, EXPLORE
      can assist in the <strong>monitoring and evaluation</strong> of ongoing prioritisation
      and experimentation. Monitoring and evaluation is crucial in every innovation
      process, as it checks whether the process is on track to reach its desired goals,
      participating actors are still on the same page and makes sure that the right
      changes can be made on the fly in a dynamic process. EXPLORE includes a wide
      spectrum of activities that can be deployed in this regard. These range from
      short and frequent like monitoring discussions or expert and stakeholder interviews
      to more intensive like on-site monitoring visits and impact workshops. M&E is
      guided by evaluative conversations rather than following up a set of indicators.
      The impact workshops can be general, but can also be more specific on a certain
      aspect where impact is challenging or highly desired to reach more specific
      feedback and results.    </p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In a nutshell, with EXPLORE
      CWTS wishes to make the valuable insights of S4 and RRI more accessible and
      easier to apply in a practical context. This will give territories a stronger
      basis to develop successful and sustainable initiatives that serve society.
      Combined with a participatory transition process this has the potential to open
      more opportunity for experimentation and social initiatives.  Hopefully, this
      will accelerate the transformation that all territories in Europe desperately
      strive for while strengthening local interests.<br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ingeborg

      transfer from universities can be intricate. The roles \u2013 and perceptions
      \u2013 of researchers, universities, and companies alike need to be considered
      on the way from ideas and inventions to innovation and investments. But in the
      end, it may just be a question of \u201CEinstein or Columbus?\u201D</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>I\u2019
      for invention</h3><p>Academic researchers and inventors are explorers \u2013&nbsp;boldly
      going where no one has gone before. Most people agree on this. However, the
      relevance of their discoveries or breakthroughs is perceived very differently
      by different groups, at least when it comes down to technology transfer of that
      invention from universities to companies. Is the discovery the work of the singular
      individual, the spark of genius and deep matter expertise that shed light on
      what would have otherwise remained in darkness \u2013 the \u2018Einstein\u2019
      type of explorer? Or is the discovery like making landfall on a distant shore,
      a shore that this just a small part of potentially an entire continent, the
      exploration of which will require effort and time by many \u2013 the \u2018Columbus\u2019
      type? </p><h3>The four I\u2019s</h3><p>In university technology transfer settings,
      the key interactions and patent licensing negotiations between the university
      and company usually evolve around the patented <em>invention</em>. The university
      researcher works from <em>idea</em> to invention and company R&D departments
      pick up the invention and turn it into <em>innovation</em>. This invention,
      often laid down in a patent application, is a central element of the transfer.
      Although the patent is arguably often the capstone for the know-how and commitment
      of the inventors, it plays a central role in university technology transfer.
      Granting a company access to such an invention, through a license or some other
      arrangement, is one of the defining transactions in technology transfer and
      often a bone of contention for many involved, researchers, technology transfer
      managers, entrepreneurs, and <em>investors</em>.</p><p>These people, usually
      overseen by the respective executive management layers, are the negotiation
      parties that have to strike the arrangements that result in the intended transfer.
      That is not always a smooth and straightforward process: their different backgrounds
      and goals lead to asymmetric information distribution, misunderstandings, and
      friction. Even the corporate R&D staff are prone to this, as the context in
      which they operate is very different from academic research environments. The
      difference is not the science underlying all their work but the processes, aims
      and structures of the organizations that drive and aim their work. The researcher\u2019s
      place in their respective organizations, and their R&D objectives, sets them
      apart when it comes to role, goal and responsibility within the tech transfer
      negotiation processes.</p><p>Such fundamental differences in perspectives between
      universities and companies are not always fully recognized, which also play
      out at the negotiation table. Take for example terminology. Although the term
      \u2018R&D\u2019 is used by both sides to describe their work, the actual activities
      will differ markedly. Moreover, a lot of university researchers will claim they
      are \u2018innovating\u2019 but their use of this catch-all term refers to \u2018newness\u2019
      in general, rather the more apt definition of an innovation in economic settings
      and the business sector: producing a \u2018new or improved product or process
      for the marketplace\u2019. In other words, innovations are produced by industry
      and it is the company that creates significant economic value \u2013 not the
      university. </p><h3>Three more I\u2019s</h3><p>To better understand the complexity
      of university technology transfer it is important to understand the \u2018human
      factor\u2019 dimension, especially the role of the university researcher who
      has made the invention. Most researchers or professors at a university lack
      extensive direct experience with industry R&D or business practices. Similarly,
      the colleagues of the company researchers are usually not very familiar with
      the culture and processes at a university and struggle to understand the university
      and its peculiar ways.</p><p>This university researcher, the Einstein, not only
      came up with the idea but also contributes in-depth expertise on the topic and
      access to a network of other experts. Especially in the case of a first patent
      application, and the tentative nature of the new invention, the company wants
      her to be part of their corporate R&D process. Such inventors may not see themselves
      as subordinates to university management and transfers of researchers (and their
      grant funding) is common; their interests and perspective may not align with
      the university\u2019s perspective. However, the university owns the right to
      the invention, making them an inseparable part of any tech transfer arrangement
      with the company. </p><p>Consequently, \u2018I, the researcher\u2019, \u2018I,
      the university\u2019 and \u2018I, the company\u2019, often have to enter into
      what amounts to a trilateral relationship within license negotiation positions.</p><h3>It
      takes two to tango, but three can be a crowd</h3><p>Research shows that these
      three groups tend to have strong opinions of each other, owing to their different
      perspectives, objectives and interests. Where the university and technology
      transfer managers see themselves as brokers, the researchers lament their lack
      of technical expertise, while the companies complain about the lack of market
      acumen. The researchers consider their invention the crucial link to new, innovative
      products, while the company sees one of multiple routes to a new product, and
      the university sees a publicly funded asset to be exploited. Managing the financially
      risky development process by the company is perceived by entrepreneurs and investors
      as a complex step towards innovation, while the researcher sees a straightforward
      path from \u2018invention to innovation\u2019, and the university may want to
      avoid a PR risk in being seen as perhaps too involved in commercial activities
      rather than its two core institutional missions (education and research). The
      organization\u2019s structure and culture impact the perception of management
      and authority. Large organizations, be it corporates or universities, operate
      on different speeds compared to eager startup companies and enterprising individual
      professors.</p><p>All of this leads to different views between the three \u2018I\u2019s\u2019
      engaged in the negotiations on tech transfer rewards and risks. The difference
      between \u2018Einstein\u2019 and \u2018Columbus\u2019 is the negotiated compensation.
      The former is an individual of unique creativity, the latter is a team player
      who reached his goal because through perseverance that. The value of a unique
      idea versus the first step of a long and winding road is different. The role
      and importance of university technology transfer for all of the \u2018I\u2019s\u2019,
      from the professor\u2019s idea and the company\u2019s innovation is an important
      value-creating trajectory; for the university it is perceived to be a tertiary
      function at best and one that comes with PR risks. Think of, for example, a
      professor suddenly the proud owner of an expensive car paid for by income generated
      from university technology transfer.</p><p>While one can lament the university\u2018s
      risk-averse culture and the friction it may create for university technology
      transfer, the challenge-driven academic research culture also fosters creativity,
      independent thought and critical thinking&nbsp;\u2013 traits that are highly
      valued in Western society and values that universities are expected to teach
      their students. Students who may also find employment in those same innovative
      companies. The duality of culture that makes it difficult to cross the \u2018public/private\u2019
      divide and collaborate with companies in the private sector, but also worthwhile
      in terms of economic gains and societal benefits. Of course many sensible people
      recognize that finding a middle ground is necessary and crucial. As Lita Nelsen,
      the former Director of the MIT Technology Licensing Office, noted on the nature
      of tech transfer: \u201CIt\u2019s not a business, but run it like a business\u201D.
      </p><h3>The I in information gap</h3><p>But what does that mean; to run it like
      a business? To make university technology transfer processes more efficient
      and effective, it is important to move beyond generalized opinions and misperceptions.
      Practice does not make perfect, but accumulating experience in tech transfer
      offers guidelines and creates valuable expertise for practitioners. But to really
      improve university technology transfer, some issues need to be made more explicit
      and information gaps need to be filled in order to have the I\u2019s come together.
      </p><p>Crucially, it is important to move beyond the general understandings
      of technology transfer negotiation processes into the nitty-gritty specifics
      of those interactions. Detailed analyses may generate new insights that can
      not only benefit new entrants in tech transfer, but also inform experienced
      practitioners on both sides of the fence \u2013 both companies and universities.
      This is the topic of ongoing research which takes individual cases as a starting
      point. Looking into the perspective of all the \u2018I\u2019s\u2019 of a patent
      licensing negotiation. It aims to identify the intentions, perceptions and the
      information gap between the various negotiating parties and their stakeholders.
      To test hypotheses based on those case studies a survey has been designed which
      will be distributed in October among interested parties through a variety of
      networks. </p><p><em>This blog post is part of my ongoing PhD study at CWTS,

      \                                               <h3><strong>Looking back</strong></h3><p>At
      the STI conference 2018 in Leiden, two strands of work at CWTS,  the Responsible
      Research and Innovation (RRI) work in the <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429298998-11\"
      target=\"_blank\">MoRRi</a> project, and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814\"
      target=\"_blank\">the regional knowledge patterns for innovation</a>, got together.
      We realized that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs093\" target=\"_blank\">RRI</a>
      (demand driven, contextual engagement in R&I) and the policy to focus on regional
      strength (<a href=\"https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/what-we-do\" target=\"_blank\">smart
      specialization</a>) could be complementary and should be developed in a concerted
      way in regions. This happened to be the topic of the Horizon 2020 Science with
      and for Society (SwafS) 14 call on \u2018Territorial RRI\u2019. In 2020 (CHERRIES)
      and 2021 (RIPEET) two H2020 3-year territorial RRI projects were granted, in
      which CWTS is partnering.</p><h3><strong>CHERRIES and RIPEET</strong></h3><p><a
      href=\"http://cherries2020.eu\" target=\"_blank\">CHERRIES </a>is about experiments
      in  Responsible Healthcare systems. The main question is how CHERRIES experiments
      can help investigate opportunities and challenges that are associated with the
      role of need and demand within the healthcare sector. CHERRIES has 11 partners
      from 7 European countries \u2013 Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, the
      Republic of Cyprus, Spain and Sweden. Coordinated by ZSI (AT), the consortium
      brings together heterogeneous actors of the innovation ecosystem, including
      small and medium enterprises, research institutions, universities, territorial
      authorities, a hospital and a Civil Society Organisation to collectively reflect
      on and design policy experiments around enabling Responsible Research and Innovation
      (RRI) in the healthcare sector in three European territories: in Murcia (ES),
      \xD6rebro (SE) and the Republic of Cyprus (CY).</p><p><a href=\"http://ripeet.eu\"
      target=\"_blank\">RIPEET </a>is about Responsible energy transition policy experiments.
      The purpose of RIPEET is to support territories in establishing experimental
      spaces to address the territorial dimensions of the European Green Deal. RRI-based
      Transition Labs will create collective stewardship of the territorial energy
      future via participatory instruments and serve as a framework for envisioning
      sustainable energy futures. RIPEET has 11 partners from 7 European countries
      \u2013 Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the UK. Coordinated
      by ZSI (AT), the consortium  brings together quintuple helix actors (policy,
      industry, academia, civil society and the environment); the team is highly inter-
      and transdisciplinary, building on long lasting experiences in RRI, territorial
      innovation and smart specialisation strategies and energy policy and research.
      The (RRI) policy experimentations for energy transition is investigated  in
      three European territories - in Extremadura (ES), Highlands and Islands of Scotland
      (UK) and Ostrobothnia (FI).</p><p>In the remainder of the blogpost we will introduce:</p><ol><li>The
      CHERRIES model, and where RIPEET is  different;</li><li>The tasks that CWTS
      is involved in based upon our expertise;</li><li>The learnings of CWTS on working
      at the science-society interface;</li><li>What we do different in RIPEET, and
      how our  work has developed into a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described
      in more detail in our next blogpost.</li></ol><h3><strong>The CHERRIES Model</strong></h3><p>The
      CHERRIES team aimed to mobilise territorial stakeholder ecosystems and engaged
      them into regional pilot actions, applying an RRI framework. The pilot actions
      include:</p><ol><li>identify needs in the healthcare sector at territorial level
      (through a call for needs);</li><li>encourage the proposition and co-creation
      of innovative solutions to the identified needs (call for solutions);</li><li>stimulate
      institutional reflection processes on how to innovate products and services
      in the healthcare sector through participatory approaches;</li><li>present evidence-based
      recommendations for revision of sectoral policies, strategies and innovation
      support instruments.</li></ol><p>The CHERRIES model (below) is based upon co-creation
      activities with stakeholders, and testing in the regions. The model works well
      to effectively develop targeted innovations and provide legitimacy and motivation
      through inclusion and engagement. However, it still lacks strategic directionality
      and misses anchoring in regional processes.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/cherries-diagram.png\"
      data-image=\"27862\"></figure><p><br>\r\nIn the figures below, the topics of
      the healthcare innovation in the three CHERRIES regions are depicted. Each of
      these pilot actions as such is carried out by local actors in a democratised
      fashion.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-murcia-orange-ribbon-hand.png\"

      data-image=\"27867\" width=\"75%\"></figure><p><br></p><p>RIPEET follows a largely
      similar approach with some changes. In RIPEET, the regions each form a so-called
      Transition Lab, which is based on <a href=\"https://co-munity.net/system/files/Geels%20and%20Schot%202007%20-%20Typology%20of%20sociotechnical%20transition%20pathways.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">the evolutionary model of socio-technical transitions (Geels
      and Schot, 2007)</a>. The Energy Transition Labs (ETL) aim to set up spaces
      for learning, interaction and interconnection between key actors (government,
      civil society, industry, academia) to collaboratively produce knowledge about
      the current problems of the energy sector, the preferred future scenarios, and
      possible strategies to achieve a sustainable vision. It includes joined reflection,
      visioning, and back casting before arriving at the needs identification and
      call for solutions which was just launched (September 2022).</p><h3><strong>CWTS
      tasks in CHERRIES and RIPEET</strong></h3><p>In CHERRIES, the role of CWTS is
      on tasks where the project can benefit from our expertise in RRI and  regional
      innovation. We are involved in the <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.22163/fteval.2022.543\"
      target=\"_blank\">mapping</a> of existing local knowledge, qualitative work
      regarding the local policy mix and the project\u2019s overall impact assessment
      / evaluation.</p><p>The mapping included a) identification of regional stakeholders
      in healthcare, research, policy, and industry; b) collecting (national and regional)
      policies on smart specialisation, RRI aspects (including those reflecting the
      RRI-keys, such as Public Engagement, Ethics, Open Access, Gender Equality, Science
      communication and governance) and healthcare innovation; and c) mapping of regional
      science and technology strengths based upon bibliometrics and project analysis.
      The rationale for the latter being that regional innovation benefits from local
      strengths.</p><p>The policy approach in CHERRIES departed from the idea how
      <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000613\"
      target=\"_blank\">technological change (invention, innovation, diffusion) is
      faced with multiple market, system and institutional failures and thus requires
      multi-faceted policy interventions (Weber and Rohracher, 2012)</a>. A policy
      mix which combines several policy instruments would be the response to this
      challenge.  However, during the project, the interactive sessions with the regional
      partners on policy revolved around two major, related, issues that are prerequisites
      for developing appropriate policy mixes: How can we develop arenas for deliberation
      that bring together stakeholders from different backgrounds to allow them to
      discuss policy jointly, and how can we make the pilot actions sustainable? As
      with many projects, there is no answer to what comes after the pilot.</p><p>The
      monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is currently ongoing. The focus is on M&E  of
      \ the territorial experimentations led by the local partners and the overall
      impact assessment of  CHERRIES as a project. In addition, M&E activities take
      into consideration the translational abilities of an interventionist project
      like CHERRIES locally and the changes these can trigger. Hence, M&E is both
      inward and outward looking.  It builds upon systematic collection of information
      in bi-monthly evaluation sessions with the regional partners on how implementation
      of smart specialisation and RRI is taking place, complemented with a site visit
      and evaluative conversations with stakeholders beyond the regional partners
      to assess how CHERRIES may have affected or even changed local policy and practice.</p><p>In
      RIPEET, CWTS is involved in similar tasks.</p><h3><strong>The learnings of CWTS
      on working at the science-society interface</strong></h3><p>Since 2014, CWTS
      is involved in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), through a range of
      activities and H2020-funded projects (e.g. <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/\"
      target=\"_blank\">MoRRI</a>, <a href=\"https://newhorrizon.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">NewHoRRIzon</a>,
      <a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">SUPER MoRRI</a>) bringing
      together R&I partners across Europe knowledgeable on RRI from different perspectives.
      Often these partners are universities, research institutes or not-for-profit
      research organisations, for which \u2018the project\u2019 is an instrument to
      do research whilst engaging with others in the field. In CHERRIES, 3 partners
      represent such a research background, of which CWTS is one. The aim of the RRI
      projects funded through the (SwafS) programme from an EC perspective is to bring
      RRI to the region, or to implement the European-oriented RRI policy in regional
      contexts. One of the major learnings is that there is a big gap between \u2018a
      policy\u2019 (RRI in this case) and bringing it to life in actual research and
      innovation practices. While co-creation is put central, projects such as CHERRIES
      and RIPEET require translation between the stakeholders involved and their diverse
      needs and wishes and the researchers in the projects.  Stakeholders occupy different
      worlds and want and need different things from our projects. It is important
      to become aware of this diversity. Drawing on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00113.x\"
      target=\"_blank\">Michel Callon\u2019s sociology of translation</a>, several
      challenges needed to be addressed in the \u2018problematization, involvement,
      enrollment and representation\u2019 in CHERRIES:  Who actually defines the regional
      healthcare problem? Project partners, stakeholders, funder?\u200B When involving
      and engaging with non-academic stakeholders: who takes ownership of processes,
      what are power dynamics and how do we include diversity?\u200B And thirdly,
      how do we translate projects into representative and effective narratives and
      indicators, that fit with the local needs and contexts. One of the major conclusions
      is that RRI as a policy when put into practice is operationalized differently
      in different contexts, and that these contexts should lead the way. The action
      research approach we eventually developed <a href=\"https://repository.fteval.at/604/\"
      target=\"_blank\">around evaluative conversations</a> works well.</p><h3><strong>What
      we do different in RIPEET</strong></h3><p>Whilst CHERRIES and RIPEET are different
      in their topic (healthcare and energy transition) and regional partners, they
      are similar in their set-up and approach. Because we started with RIPEET exactly
      a year later, we at CWTS were able to improve how to connect our contribution
      to the rest of the project. This was particularly relevant since in CHERRIES
      we realised that preparing a mapping, including bibliometrics, goes well beyond
      the interest and understanding of the partners. In other words, to make our
      contribution useful for our partners and beyond, we as well should translate
      the needs and adjust our work. In RIPEET, we therefore worked much more demand-driven,
      leaving the lead to the regional partners, as the mapping should serve their
      purpose, and not necessarily our own ideas. So the mapping exercise became an
      integral part of the Transition labs, and was co-created with the local partners.
      Interestingly, the joint mapping, in an iterative process, resulted in partly
      similar topics of attention (CWTS and region), but also additional ones that
      were shaped by local context and needs, and also, types of partners involved
      in the process. As such, the ownership of the mapping process was better accounted
      for.</p><p>Our  work, combining mapping and evaluative conversations to serve
      both RRI and Smart Specialisation (a regional innovation policy) has developed
      into a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described in more detail in our next
      blogpost.</p><p>In conclusion, the territorial RRI projects have allowed us
      to travel and explore the science-society interface by engaging with local non-academic
      stakeholders from the start; to become embedded action researchers in a co-creative
      process, and to realise that it takes a lot of effort to bring science out of
      its own world to society.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ingeborg

      July 2022, the first SciCon took place with the aim of connecting the metascience

      summarizes the experience and introduces DeSci to the reader.</summary><content

      event</h3><p><a href=\"https://researchhubevents.wixsite.com/scicon2022\" target=\"_blank\">SciCon
      2022</a>&nbsp;has been an online event seeking to bring together members of
      the academic metascience community and DeSci, to discuss some of the issues
      that exist in scientific research and highlight how DeSci efforts might contribute
      to improve the way we do science. SciCon has been organized by one of the leading
      DeSci initiatives: <a href=\"https://www.researchhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ResearchHub</a>.</p><p>While
      the conference included tutorials, community workshops and even a week-long
      community competition to write new contributions, talks were organized over
      two days and included a rich set of topics. Several prominent DeSci projects
      and initiatives were presented, with themes as varied as decentralized medical
      trials (Azizi Seixas, NYU\u2019s Langone Health), decentralized research centers
      (Eugene Leventhal, Smart Contract Research Forum), open verifiability and reproducible,
      on-chain scientific records (Christopher Hill, DeSci Labs), among many more.
      For the metascience community, Silvio Peroni presented on how to enable reproducible
      studies through <a href=\"https://opencitations.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Open
      Citations</a>,&nbsp;Ludo Waltman introduced the recently launched <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u201CPublish your Reviews\u201D initiative</a>,&nbsp;while
      I presented on the (selfish) <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416\"
      target=\"_blank\">advantages of making research data open</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXFb8mLcUqc&list=PLF2d5YJZiYG1wz90TdKrBKBXg0BSU-LcC&index=4\"
      target=\"_blank\">In their talk</a>, the co-founders of ResearchHub Patrick
      Joyce and Brian Armstrong further explained the motivation for SciCon and, more
      broadly, their vision for DeSci.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://researchhubevents.wixsite.com/scicon2022/schedule\"
      target=\"_blank\">full program of SciCon</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VTQ72h0_x0&list=PLF2d5YJZiYG1wz90TdKrBKBXg0BSU-LcC\"
      target=\"_blank\">all the talks</a>&nbsp;are available online, I invite you
      to take a closer look.</p><h3>Decentralized Science</h3><p>But what is DeSci
      exactly? On <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/desci/\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum.org</a>,
      we find the following definition:</p><p>In short, projects in DeSci apply blockchain
      technology to science. DeSci is inspired by the open knowledge movement and
      related to the open software and open science communities and efforts.</p><p>In
      a brief period, the DeSci landscape grew substantially on the onset of the general
      2021 blockchain and crypto currency boom.</p><p>A recent illustration of the
      DeSci landscape is provided in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit\"
      target=\"_blank\">DeSci Wiki</a><em>(</em><em>@</em><em>UltraRare Bio)</em>:</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_picture1.jpg\" alt=\"Desci
      picture1\"></figure><p>The DeSci movement is diverse, yet several biotechnology
      initiatives stand out, including funding organizations, decentralized laboratories,
      incubators and more. <a href=\"https://www.molecule.to/\" target=\"_blank\">Molecule</a>
      is developing a decentralized protocol to fund and manage research-related IP
      (Intellectual Property) in biotech.&nbsp;Key to Molecule\u2019s approach is
      the use of blockchains to accelerate funding biotech research and building a
      marketplace for the generated IP. They recently raised above 12M$ in venture
      funds for future development. Many more Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
      (DAOs) also play a prominent role in DeSci. These are communities managed via
      blockchains, sometimes associated with incorporated entities (e.g., companies),
      just like Molecule. Another example is <a href=\"https://www.vitadao.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">VitaDAO</a>, focused on crowdfunding longevity research through
      the VITA token.</p><p>Scientific publishing also attracts considerable effort
      in DeSci, especially towards re-designing the peer review system. Science Non-Fungible
      Tokens (NFTs) are used to record and manage scientific outputs, for example
      Intellectual Property, reviews and publications. Several initiatives focus on
      funding research or other forms of commons with a considerable degree of different
      instruments. <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/grants\" target=\"_blank\">Gitcoin
      Grants</a>&nbsp;fund public commons via <a href=\"https://wtfisqf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quadratic
      Funding, an optimal way for crowdfunding public resources within a community</a>.&nbsp;Lastly,
      it is worth mentioning that some research-focused organizations have also been
      started with ties, yet not a direct involvement with DeSci. For example, the
      <a href=\"https://astera.org/fros\" target=\"_blank\">Astera Institute specializes
      in frontier research and technology projects (including on metascience) using
      Focused Research Organizations (FROs)</a> as an instrument to combine the two.</p><p>On
      this <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/desci\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>, we
      can find an (optimistic) overview of the ways in which DeSci could contribute
      to improve the scientific ecosystem:<br></p><p><grammarly-extension data-grammarly-shadow-root=\"true\"

      convincing to me, or at least not clearly benefitting from using blockchain
      technology (e.g., 2, 4, 7 or even 8), others not only intervene on open challenges
      in the science ecosystem, but also promise to leverage the strengths of blockchain
      technology (e.g., 1, 3, 5 or 6). Personally, the areas where I see most promise
      for DeSci include 1) developing open and distributed infrastructures to track
      and incentivize scientific outcomes (e.g., reviews and replications), 2) opening
      alternative sources of funding, and 3) providing a playground to experiment
      with organization and incentive design in science (e.g., including around publishing
      and funding). </p><p>ResearchHub, the organizer of SciCon 2022, is a decentralized
      autonomous organization (DAO) attempting to combine all three of these aspects.
      Let us take a closer look to further showcase how blockchain technology is being
      used in DeSci.</p><h3>A DeSci organization: ResearchHub</h3><p>ResearchHub is
      a community effort to accelerate the pace of scientific research by making its
      publication, review and discussion more open and collaborative. The Hub uses
      a crypto currency (Research Coin or RSC) to incentivize participation. The portal
      currently supports a variety of science publishing activities including sharing,
      discussing and reviewing articles, or even incentivizing activities via bounties,
      such as answering a research question.</p><p>A central feature of ResearchHub
      is the possibility to upload a research paper (or pre-print) for further analysis,
      as in this <a href=\"https://www.researchhub.com/paper/1272956/a-through-intact-skull-tis-chronic-window-technique-for-cortical-structure-and-function-observation-in-mice\"

      alt=\"Desci figure2\"></figure><p>A paper can then be openly discussed, peer
      reviewed or summarized (like in this case), via an interaction like Reddit\u2019s:</p><figure><img

      know more</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-03642-9\" target=\"_blank\">DeSci
      has so far developed with little input from the scientific community.</a>&nbsp;While
      the movement is young and sensitive to the broader crypto market sentiment,
      we can certainly use more experimentation in how we go about doing science.
      Often, it is easier and faster to think outside of the established system. This
      means that, while many, if not most DeSci projects might not last, the movement
      has the potential to develop out-of-the-box solutions to at least some of the
      considerable challenges currently facing scientific research. To know more,
      the best way is to check <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit\"

      pressing societal issues of our time, but to what extent are engineers reflecting

      the engineering knowledge behind AI?</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>We are witnessing a vertiginous
      global technological development, but this development is not paralleled with
      a growing improvement in the sustainable development of the planet. For instance,
      next-generation computing, air transport, energy production, and more recently
      the development of 5G technologies, cryptocurrencies - among others - enhance
      human capacity in certain directions but limit it in others: they increase our
      dependence on non-renewable sources and increase the inequalities between countries
      that provide such resources and countries that develop these technologies. If
      we do not connect our technological development with global priorities \u2013
      such as the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/es/goals\" target=\"_blank\">UN Sustainable
      Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, how can we preserve the future of humans and other
      beings on the planet?  </p><p>In <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj5kr/\"
      target=\"_blank\">our study</a>, we evaluate the relationship between published
      engineering research and sustainable development and focus on two key points
      that are getting little attention:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A large extent of AI&nbsp;engineering
      research papers do not incorporate sustainability goals in their reflections
      on the development of technology.</li></ul><ul><li>The extent to which countries
      have the ability to produce new knowledge on AI, which we refer to as <em>AI
      engineering research capabilities</em>, are being increasingly concentrated
      on  powerful countries, leaving the scientifically marginalized countries with
      little room to define the directions of AI and assess the implications of AI
      research.</li></ul><p>In this blog post, we show&nbsp;our findings that support
      these observations.</p><p>On the first point, given that technologies can be
      used in different ways and that academia is one of the main engines for their
      development, it is necessary for academia to motivate critical thinking and
      reflect on the potential uses of technologies. However, we found that sustainable
      development issues are little addressed in global engineering research, specifically
      in artificial intelligence We found that it is not common to find researchers'
      reflections on the impact of their inventions on the planet in AI publications,
      as well as their potential uses to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Out of 220,000
      engineering articles indexed by IEEE Xplore on AI published from 2000 to 2020,
      only  8% to 30% approximately -depending on the engineering discipline- discuss
      issues related to their contribution to sustainable development. </p><p>Those
      disciplines that discuss sustainable development in more than 20% of their production
      focus on cognitive and cooperative systems, prediction methods, decision support
      systems, and computation theory. Other disciplines, such as learning systems,
      bio-inspired computing, and autonomous robots, which are crucial for sustainable
      development, discuss it to a much lesser extent (see figure 1).&nbsp;</p><p>While
      it can be argued that entrepreneurs and other parties will find applications
      of these technologies to sustainable development, scholars such as Yuval Noah-Harari
      have warned that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yuval-noah-harari-sapiens-60-minutes-2021-10-31\">what
      drives the development of AI is not an ambition to solve our main societal issues,
      but rather increasing profits and surveillance of the population</a>. We contend,
      then, that at a time of planetary crisis we need more awareness and commitment
      of engineers to help envision applications for solving the major challenges
      of our time. Not engaging in the potential uses of technologies poses a risk
      of a disconnection between  AI engineering research and these societal issues,
      leaving the development of these technologies to the forces of the market and
      state control.<br></p><p></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/20220906_picture1_2022-09-07-112526_euda.png\"

      point, we found a disproportionate concentration of AI engineering research

      this trend of concentration of engineering research capabilities \u2013 the
      extent to which countries can produce new knowledge - continues, how can it
      be ensured that all countries have a voice and can act on the development of
      AI technologies? Additionally, to successfully regulate these technologies,
      research capabilities are pivotal. Lacking such capabilities means that potential
      regulations, such as limitations to data collection, manipulation, and algorithm
      biases, may not be ensured because of a lack of infrastructure to reproduce
      research results and technologies, and a lack of local expertise to audit them.<br></p><p>A
      hopeful finding in our article is that sustainable development is increasingly
      being discussed in certain AI-related engineering disciplines. We identified
      <em>Broadcast technology</em>, <em>Systems Engineering and Theory</em>,<em>
      Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control</em>,<em> Sensors</em>, and<em>
      Education</em>. Specifically on AI subjects, we found emerging discussions of
      sustainable development in <em>Recurrent neural Networks</em>, <em>Prediction
      Methods</em>, <em>Computation Theory</em>, <em>Learning Systems</em>, and <em>Machine
      learning</em>. We believe building on these emerging interests can help to educate
      engineers that are more concerned with their natural and social environment.&nbsp;</p><p>However,
      to foster the relevance of AI research for sustainable development, capabilities
      need to be built in those countries that have traditionally been marginalized.
      A decisive and generous approach to international collaboration and knowledge
      exchange needs to be supported and fostered by multilateral organizations such
      as the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">OECD</a> and
      the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a>&nbsp;if
      contribution of AI research for sustainable development -leaving no one behind-
      is to be achieved.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that power is in the hands of a few countries,
      coordinated programs and funding in regions such as Latin America and South
      Saharan Africa need to be developed and maintained over the long-term if these
      regions want to exert real influence on the global AI agenda, rather than being
      mere subordinated consumers of AI.</p><span class=\"caption\">Photo by&nbsp;@DeepMind</span>\n\n

      fourth CWTS Summer School took place from June 20 to July 1, 2022. Scientometric
      scholars from over 23 different countries representing an array of disciplinary
      backgrounds met online and in-person in Leiden to learn, share and network on
      scientometric methods.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      2022 <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2022\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS Summer School</a> provided a thorough introduction to
      scientometrics. First, we defined scientometrics. We then discussed major scientometric
      data sources, their strengths and limitations, including Web of Science, Scopus,
      and Dimensions as well as explored cutting edge tools available to scientometricians,
      including <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/icsr/icsrlab\" target=\"_blank\">Elsevier\u2019s
      International Center for the Study of Research Lab (ICSR)</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions on Google Big Query</a>.</p><p>We learned how to
      construct and analyse a network using quantitative and scientometric methods
      based on scientometric data relationships, such as causal inference, text analysis,
      and network analysis. We also had the opportunity to experience working with
      the VOSviewer software to gain an intuitive understanding of visualisation techniques.</p><p>Furthermore,
      the summer school offered various alternative perspectives on the study of science.
      We learned about altmetrics as indicators of science-society interactions, about&nbsp;the
      connections between Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Scientometrics,
      and between&nbsp;the Science of Science and the Sociology of Science. These
      perspectives on science are unlocking a new era of scientometric thinking, enriching
      our knowledge, and broadening our horizons. They also inspire us to think about
      our own research in new ways. </p><h3>Student presentations</h3><p>To conclude
      on the content part of the summer school, it would be relevant to mention the
      student presentations. Due to our different disciplinary backgrounds, we exchanged
      ideas on a wide variety of research topics, which had a very special significance
      for us in the summer school. Among other topics, we talked about translational
      psychotherapy, the role of gender in solar energy research in Turkey, public
      policies in Latin America, and public research&nbsp;institutions in Korea. We
      talked about the terms \"ultrafine particles and nanoparticles\", and \"elderly
      independent living\" as well as broader topics such as education policy during
      the COVID-19 pandemic and health data sharing. Although we focussed mainly on
      scientometric methods, there was no lack of diversity in the way to apply them:
      we looked at citation behavior, talked about the development of new indicators,
      the relationship between survey data and bibliographic data, and learned more
      about grant proposals, delayed recognition in science, and the quantification
      of adjacent in distant reuse of references within disciplines. </p><h3>Global
      summer school: a hybrid experience</h3><p>This edition of the CWTS Summer School
      was the first to offer a hybrid learning experience, and like all first times,
      it brought a few challenges. Still, the hybrid mode enriched diversity by including
      participants who otherwise could not have enjoyed the summer school. We could
      classify the challenges into two main categories: unexpected comical MS Teams
      happenings and issues related to technicalities. On the comical side, we encountered
      unintentional unmuting and cat appearances, and on the technical side, we sometimes
      experienced poor connections and sound issues. However, all challenges were
      professionally managed by the teachers, not affecting the rhythm and pace of
      the summer school. One on-site participant said: \"I found the hybrid format
      very enriching. Getting to know Leiden and the CWTS on site was great, but equally
      great were the digital presentations and the enrichment of the discussions provided
      by those connected online. Apart from the content of this course, networking
      and being able to exchange were the two&nbsp;main arguments for me to take part
      in the summer school - there was nothing else to be desired.\u201D</p><p>From
      the perspective of the online participants, the hybrid environment felt like
      being in a movie; there were camera-shifting angles and zoom-in to participants
      speaking in person. Also, the teachers managed the time for Q&A and discussion
      equally for all participants. In conclusion, although online participants were
      not in the room, their valuable contributions showed the importance of bringing
      their voices into this edition of the summer school.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/IMG_20220701_153030.jpg\"
      alt=\"IMG 20220701 153030\"></figure><h3>Impact beyond classroom</h3><p>The
      summer school came just at the right time when most of the participants needed
      it. Indeed, it came at a point where most of us are working on metric-related
      studies but needed a broader understanding and to&nbsp;learn more about the
      distinctions between scientometrics, bibliometrics, and altmetrics. Discussions
      and clarifications on these approaches and on methods applied to diverse types
      of studies benefited most participants. Participants who got the opportunity
      to present their work-in-progress received comments from fellow participants
      which in return aided in improving their work.</p><p>According to one participant:
      \u201CThe summer school helped me to address critical comments of reviewers
      regarding the 'methodology' section of an article about the impact of international
      collaboration on Namibian science production\". </p><p>All the information on
      data sources and different tools used in scientometric studies provided during
      this course is a bonus that will enrich the future scientometric-related studies
      of all participants. Additionally, free access to data sources such as the ICSR
      Lab and Dimensions on Google Big Query will provide an opportunity for participants
      to use data for further exploration in metric-related studies. Empowered by
      the knowledge gained at the summer school, we look forward to expanding the
      frontiers of scientometric research together in the future.</p><p><sub>Photo

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3><strong>Background:
      Russian Academic Excellence Project 5top100</strong></h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.5top100.ru/en/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Russian Academic Excellence Project 5top100</a><a href=\"https://www.5top100.ru/en/\"></a>
      is a Russian excellence initiative in higher education that ran from 2013 to
      2020. The aim of the initiative was to place five Russian universities in the
      top 100 of global university rankings. The goal was not achieved; in political
      and academic discourses, there are conflicting assessments of the results of
      the project. On the one hand, the main goal of the project was not achieved;
      no five project participants got into the top 100 of the most common global
      university rankings (here we mean ARWU, THE and QS rankings). On the other hand,
      the Accounts Chamber (official auditor of the state budget) noted that the implementation
      of the 5top100 project made it possible to form a group of leading universities
      in the country, as well as to integrate Russia into the global trends in the
      implementation of academic excellence programs and strengthen the scale and
      significance of Russian university science in the world. We tried to look at
      the problem from inside the university.</p><p>The Ural Federal University has
      been involved in the project from the very beginning. The main mechanism for
      bringing public funding to the final recipients was the creation and development
      of research groups. This scheme was typical for most of the participants of
      the 5top100 project. To the best of our knowledge, <a href=\"https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economy/article/view/6069\"
      target=\"_blank\">our work</a> offers the first study of the results of the
      implementation of the excellence initiative not at the level of universities,
      but at the level of research units. This approach was made possible thanks to
      the availability of structured data for the period 2014-2020 provided by the
      Department of Strategic Development and Marketing.</p><h3><strong>Key results</strong></h3><p>In
      total, the analysis included performance indicators of 79 research groups. The
      number of articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science was used as the main
      indicator. As an alternative indicator of quality, we used the number of articles
      in journals with an impact factor above two. Unfortunately, disciplinary features
      were not taken into account in the process of research assessment, so the threshold
      was the same for all groups. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive
      relationship between the dynamics of these two indicators (0.56); thus, we refuted
      the widely held assumption that stimulating quantitative growth of publications
      necessarily leads to a decrease in their quality. Our results indirectly support
      the existence of <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166149\"
      target=\"_blank\">constant or increasing marginal returns for most research
      areas</a>.</p><p>The amount of funding was set annually depending on the type
      of group and the performance for the previous period. The type of group (research
      group, research laboratory, center of excellence) was determined depending on
      the number and level of group members. Paradoxically, funding (current and previous)
      does not have a significant effect on the change in research group productivity.
      Moreover, in some cases there was an inverse relationship. We can assume that
      in this case, prospective funding plays a more significant role than current
      level of funding. For example, a decrease in funding forces a group to work
      harder in the hope of increasing funding in the future. It is important to note
      that this variable refers exclusively to government funding. In terms of R&D
      revenue, we found an inverse relationship: the more R&D revenue, the smaller
      the increase in the number of articles. Thus, we can state that publications
      and innovative activities  (measured as R&D income in our case) in research
      groups are substituting, not complementary.</p><p>No less surprising is the
      fact that the experience of the research leader of the group also has an inverse
      relationship with the increase in performance. This does not mean that groups
      with an experienced leader have poor results, quite the contrary. However, the
      results of such groups tend to be stable rather than growing.</p><p>Our study
      showed that the main factor influencing research productivity is the size of
      the research group. The age of the project, defined as the period of time from
      the establishment of a group to the termination of its operation, is also important.
      Note that we performed separate analyses for social and humanities areas (15
      of the 79 groups) and all others. Interestingly, the age of the group has the
      greatest significance for both models in the social sciences and humanities
      fields with either the number of articles or articles in the journals with IF
      &gt; 2 as dependent variables. We attribute this to the fact that there are
      fewer journals in these areas (purely humanities journals do not have an impact
      factor in principle); respectively, it takes more time to accumulate publications
      in top journals. Moreover, it simply takes more time to publish anything in
      these fields compared to natural and technical sciences. Thus, we can conclude
      that social sciences and humanities projects require a longer planning horizon
      so that one can see the effects from funding.</p><p>In conclusion, our study
      found that:</p><ul><li>The main factors affecting the performance of research
      teams are the number of participants and the age of the project (the latter
      especially for social sciences and humanities)</li><li>Funding (current and
      previous) has no impact on performance, although it certainly affects the ability
      to hire more team members</li><li>Decrease in current funding can paradoxically
      increase productivity</li><li>Experienced researchers are more likely to create
      stable rather than rapidly developing groups in terms of publication activity</li><li>Publication
      and R&D activities are at least partly substituting towards each other</li></ul><p>The
      study focused on one university, and the number of research groups is relatively
      small. Comparative analysis and expansion of the empirical base will provide
      more meaningful results in the future. For example, it will be interesting to
      compare the performance of research groups across different disciplines in a
      larger sample.&nbsp;Another limitation is that only two databases (Scopus and
      Web of Science) were used in the evaluation procedure and in this study&nbsp;as
      well. The results obtained are highly dependent on the sources of bibliometric
      data. This study mainly covered quantitative performance indicators but did
      not touch upon other project outcomes such as increased academic mobility and
      foreign recruitment. </p><h3><strong>Concluding reflections</strong></h3><p>Our
      study showed that the 5top100 project empowered a dramatic increase in the number
      of publications by Russian scientists in international databases. This statement
      is true for both a particular university and the country as a whole. Below is
      the statistics of publications for 2013-2020 for the Ural Federal University,
      participants of the 5top100 project, and Russia.<strong></strong><strong><br></strong></p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure1_new_2022-08-06-092417_jctn.png\"
      alt=\"Figure1 new\"></figure><p>In the end, I would like to return to where
      I started this post, i.e., to the project 5top100. In my opinion, the Project
      failed to solve two major problems of Russian higher education. First, there
      remains a monstrous gap between the budgets of the world's leading universities
      and Russian universities. Universities should have a more balanced funding structure
      with more private participation, for example in the form of revenue from R&D.
      It is impossible to solve this problem solely at the expense of public funds,
      and the demand for university research products (first of all, innovations)
      from the leading Russian companies is still at a consistently low level. The
      reality is that most of the science-intensive products are purchased abroad,
      with the only exception for the military complex. Secondly, the 5 top100 project
      did not lead to institutional changes within the universities and in the national
      higher education system. All changes were implemented in the traditional rigid
      vertical with no real autonomy of universities (all project participants are
      state universities) and decentralization within universities. The quality of
      academic institutions, and first of all, academic freedom determines academic
      excellence, in my opinion. Therefore, it will be interesting to observe not
      only the research performance issues under the new <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia\"
      target=\"_blank\">Priority 2030 project</a>, but also how the new program will
      cope with these two challenges.</p><p><em>This text is solely the personal position

      June 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/10/council-provides-political-orientations-on-international-cooperation-open-science-and-european-missions/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Council of the European Union gave the green light for a European
      Agreement on research assessment reforms</a> to go ahead. Plans for this initiative
      were proposed in a <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/36ebb96c-50c5-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\"
      target=\"_blank\">European Commission scoping report in 2021</a>. Under the
      Agreement, research actors across European member states (including research
      performing organizations, funders, and national or regional assessment organizations)
      will be invited to sign up voluntarily and pledge their commitment to translate
      principles outlined in the report into local assessment reforms. </p><p>The
      initiative builds on ten years or more of campaigns movements to curb the misappropriation
      of research metrics in academic research assessment contexts, to broaden quality
      criteria and to change research culture more broadly. The fact that such an
      influential actor as the European Commission has taken up the research assessment
      reform baton suggests this agenda truly has landed, at least in certain policy
      spaces (see also recent reform efforts being coordinated within the Netherlands,
      Finland, and Norway) (P\xF6l\xF6nen and Mustajoki 2022).<sup><a id=\"footnote-1-ref\"
      href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Following the decision to press ahead with
      the Agreement, I would like to reflect on the strategy the European Commission
      appears to be adopting for facilitating such reforms, and consider some of the
      opportunities and challenges their approach may encounter. Before doing so,
      I briefly outline what principles the European Commission considers to be central
      to more responsible and fair modes of research assessment.</p><p>The European
      Commission\u2019s scoping report laments the current state of research assessment
      in Europe, which it states is driven by races for publications and citations,
      at the expense of quality, and which leads to a publish or perish culture that
      is damaging for research and researchers. The optimum method for research assessment
      is said to be qualitative peer review, and while the report adopts a critical
      tone towards uses of research metrics in research assessment - it does not completely
      reject their use as long as they are used appropriately in supporting (not replacing)
      qualitative decision making (citing, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto</a>). By signing the Agreement, research
      actors are effectively committing to ensure that their research assessments
      will:</p><ul><li>recognize and reward the plurality of contributions researchers
      make to academic life (not just publishing and bringing in grant money)</li><li>respect
      epistemic differences between research fields</li><li>reward new (or newly emphasized)
      quality dimensions such as open science (broadly defined), research integrity,
      and societal relevance, when evaluating individuals, institutions and research
      proposals. </li></ul><p>As with the majority of efforts to initiate reforms
      of research assessment over the past decade, the European Commission Agreement
      is an example of \u2018soft governance\u2019, with the emphasis on steering
      from a distance rather than hierarchical imposition. The scoping report avoids
      giving precise prescriptions on how to implement reforms \u2013 rather it provides
      a broad vision and signposting to researchers and research organizations on
      how and why they should seek to redefine research quality, arguing that adhering
      to such values is commensurate with better (or more responsible) \u2018academic
      citizenship\u2019. To reiterate, signing the Agreement will be voluntary and
      <em>not </em>a legally binding commitment: while there may be reputational fallout
      if a signatory were to be seen as not acting within the spirit of the Agreement,
      there are unlikely to be formal sanctions. </p><h3>How far can \u2018soft governance\u2019
      take research assessment reform efforts? <br></h3><p>A \u2018soft governance\u2019
      approach like the Agreement has its attractions for different actors across
      the&nbsp;European research landscape: in a period of restricted economic growth
      and belt tightening around public funding, the Agreement requires little fresh
      money from the Commission, with individual signatories expected to self-fund
      their internal changes. The fact an actor like the Commission has so visibly
      put their weight behind this agenda will no doubt help local change agents when
      lobbying for their own research organizations to revisit current assessment
      practices. Likewise the lack of top-down prescriptiveness about what exactly
      the reforms should look like affords agency and flexibility to those on-the-ground
      in universities, funding bodies or assessment agencies to enact changes in a
      \u2018bottom up\u2019 way. On the flipside, one can envision potential limitations
      to this soft governance approach: lack of new, centralized funding means universities
      and other research actors may not wish (or be able) to invest their own scarce
      resources in enacting this agenda. Furthermore, the voluntary \u2018opt in\u2019
      nature of the changes may well mean they can be easily ignored by those for
      whom the shared visions for change do not resonate. Soft governance mechanisms
      like voluntary agreements ultimately rely on their intended audience getting
      excited about the vision being set out or feeling a social pressure to conform,
      but if big players are seen as ignoring these calls, or organizations see them
      as too difficult to achieve, then the reforms will likely only be taken up sporadically
      by a handful of enthusiasts. </p><p>Another concern mentioned in the scoping
      report is the risk that research system actors in some member states will adopt
      reforms much quicker or enthusiastically than others, thus threatening potentially
      the logic of a common European Research Area (ERA), which envisions a single
      borderless market for research and for researchers. At national and local levels,
      influential actors with potential wrecking power may present opposition to the
      reforms. We have already seen criticisms being voiced against the Agreement
      from national research actors, for example in Germany, where <a href=\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/research-assessment-german-funder-raises-concerns-eu-reform-talks-come-close\"
      target=\"_blank\">an alliance of research organizations responded to the plans
      for the Agreement by stating they are against plans for a \u2018harmonized\u2019
      European-wide assessment system and declaring they will not be signing up</a>.
      Opposition and counter-reform movements are challenges for which champions of
      European research assessment reform should prepare themselves.</p><p>As such,
      there could well be a bumpy road ahead towards reformed research assessment
      practices becoming mainstream across the European Union. In Leiden, the need
      to make sense of assessment reform developments in Europe and beyond has prompted
      us to establish a <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/thematic-hubs/responsible-evaluation\"
      target=\"_blank\">Responsible Evaluation thematic hub</a> in our institute,
      CWTS. Through the Responsible Evaluation Hub, CWTS colleagues will meet bi-monthly
      to discuss ongoing developments around research assessment reforms, including
      projects we are involved in, external initiatives, and to act as a sounding
      board for colleagues\u2019 own encounters with \u2018responsibility\u2019 dilemmas.
      We think there will be plenty to discuss. </p><p><span id=\"footnote-1\" class=\"caption\"><a

      closed nature of the traditional journal peer review system is often criticized.
      Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to make peer review
      more open. Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan van Eck use data from Crossref to analyze
      the growth of open peer review.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                                                                   <p
      dir=\"ltr\">Twenty years ago, Fiona Godlee, at that time Editorial Director
      for Medicine at open access publisher BioMed Central, wrote a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762\"
      target=\"_blank\">sharp critique</a> of the traditional system of closed pre-publication
      peer review, arguing that the system needs to be opened and drawing attention
      to the opportunities offered by \u201Cpreprint servers combined with open commentary\u201D
      to realize this openness. In subsequent years, Godlee contributed to increasing
      openness in peer review as Editor-in-Chief of the <em>British Medical Journal</em>,
      a journal with a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7175.4\" target=\"_blank\">long-standing
      commitment to open peer review</a>.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To what extent have
      ideas on open peer review developed by Godlee and others been realized over
      the past two decades? There is no straightforward answer to this question, since
      the availability of systematic data on peer review practices is limited. In
      this blog post, we use <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00022\" target=\"_blank\">data
      from Crossref</a> to offer some partial insights into the growing popularity
      of open peer review.<br></p><h3><strong>Open peer review - Journal articles</strong><br></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Two years ago, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03488-4\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dietmar Wolfram and colleagues</a> revealed a strong growth
      in recent years in the number of journals supporting some form of open peer
      review. Over 600 journals offered open peer review in 2019. These journals published
      the reports of reviewers, the identities of reviewers, or both.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure
      1 shows a similar growth in the number of peer review records in Crossref that
      are linked to a journal article. This number increased from fewer than 10,000
      in 2018 to more than 60,000 in 2020 and 2021. Each of these peer review records
      represents a review report of a reviewer, a decision letter of an editor, or
      a response letter of an author. Many journal articles&nbsp;are linked to multiple
      peer review records in Crossref. In 2021, over 13,000 journal articles had a
      link to one or more peer review records.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-1.png\"

      article</span><p><br>As shown in Figure 2, <a href=\"https://publons.com/benefits/publishers/transparent-review\"
      target=\"_blank\">Publons</a> is by far the largest contributor of peer review
      records in Crossref, accounting for two-third of all records. A large majority
      of these records are linked to journal articles published by Wiley. Indeed,
      Wiley has made a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.22541/au.160026642.27642568/v2\"
      target=\"_blank\">considerable effort</a> to promote open peer review (referred
      to as transparent peer review by Wiley). Other important contributors of peer
      review records in Crossref are PeerJ and eLife.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-2.png\"

      platform (left); Breakdown by publisher for Publons peer review records (right).<br></span></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><br>Importantly, there are several publishers that publish review
      reports but don\u2019t register a Crossref DOI for these reports. This is for
      instance the case for BMJ, EMBO, MDPI, PLOS, and Springer Nature. There is no
      straightforward way to determine the number of review reports published by these
      publishers, although some figures can be obtained from information provided
      by the publishers. MDPI for instance reports that in 2020 it published review
      reports for <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/anniversary25/blog/open-peer-review\"
      target=\"_blank\">over 34,000 articles</a>. Recent statistics for PLOS show
      that PLOS published review reports for <a href=\"https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/\"
      target=\"_blank\">more than 7,500 articles in 2021</a>. For Springer Nature
      recent statistics don\u2019t seem to be available, but the journal <em>Nature</em>
      reports to have published review reports <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00493-w\"
      target=\"_blank\">for almost 450 articles in 2021</a>. While precise figures
      aren\u2019t available, it is clear that the total number of articles in 2021
      for which review reports were published without a DOI is much larger than the
      13,000 articles for which review reports were published with a DOI. Hence, a
      large majority of the published review reports don\u2019t have a persistent
      identifier and don\u2019t have openly available metadata. This severely limits
      the value of these reports.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Open peer review may refer
      not only to publication of review reports, but also to publication of identities
      of reviewers. The pros and cons of disclosing reviewer identities have been
      <a href=\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/21/open-reviewer-identities-full-steam-ahead-or-proceed-with-caution/\"
      target=\"_blank\">discussed extensively</a>. For peer review records in Crossref
      classified as review report (instead of decision letter or author response),
      we found that the identity of the reviewer is disclosed in 39% of the cases.<br></p><h3><strong>Open
      peer review - Preprints</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A
      recent development is the publication of review reports for preprints instead
      of journal articles. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8zj9w\">variety
      of platforms and initiatives</a> offer a range of different approaches to peer
      review of preprints.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 3 shows the growth in the number
      of preprint peer review records in Crossref. While the number of records is
      much smaller than for journal articles, the growth is impressive, from 20 records
      in 2019 to 733 records in 2021. Three platforms, <a href=\"https://www.qeios.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Qeios</a>, <a href=\"https://rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu/\"
      target=\"_blank\">MIT Press Rapid Reviews COVID-19</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.scienceopen.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ScienceOpen</a>, account for almost all preprint peer review
      records in Crossref. A small number of records originate from <a href=\"https://publons.com/\">Publons</a>,
      and a few records represent <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/making-my-peer-review-activity-more-useful\"
      target=\"_blank\">review reports published by one of us</a> using the <a href=\"https://help.pubpub.org/pub/preprints-toolkit/release/4\"
      target=\"_blank\">PubPub platform</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-3.png\"

      3. Peer review records in Crossref linked to a preprint: Growth in the number
      of records (left); Breakdown by platform (right).<br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Many
      review reports for preprints don\u2019t have a Crossref DOI. These reports aren\u2019t
      included in the statistics presented in Figure 3. This is for instance the case
      for review reports from <a href=\"https://prereview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PREreview</a>,
      a platform for preprint peer review that uses DOIs from DataCite instead of
      Crossref. PREreview currently contains more than 250 review reports (excluding
      so-called rapid reviews). Other review reports for preprints don\u2019t have
      a DOI at all. This applies both to review reports published directly on a preprint
      server and to review reports published on various preprint peer review platforms.
      The latter reports may be visible in <a href=\"https://sciety.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sciety</a>,
      a platform that aggregates review reports and other evaluations of preprints
      from a variety of sources.<br></p><h3><strong>Open peer review - Copernicus
      and F1000</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong></strong><strong></strong>Copernicus
      and F1000 are special cases. Copernicus offers an <a href=\"https://publications.copernicus.org/services/public_peer_review.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">integrated platform</a> that publishes both journal articles
      and preprints as well as the associated review reports. Likewise, F1000 provides
      a platform that publishes multiple versions of an article, including the review
      reports for each version. Because of their special nature, we present statistics
      for Copernicus and F1000 separately from the statistics reported above. Peer
      review records for Copernicus and F1000 aren\u2019t included in Figures 1, 2,
      and 3.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Figure 4 shows the growth in the number of peer review
      records for Copernicus and F1000. The statistics for F1000 were obtained from
      DataCite instead of Crossref, because F1000 uses DataCite to register DOIs for
      review reports. Copernicus is a major contributor of peer review records in
      Crossref, especially in earlier years. F1000 is a pioneer in registering DOIs
      for review reports, starting in 2012. The number of peer review records for
      F1000 is much smaller than for Copernicus, but it has shown a steady growth
      over the past decade.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-4.png\"

      dir=\"ltr\">The statistics presented in this blog post show an impressive growth
      in the adoption of open peer review, especially in recent years. Nevertheless,
      the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762\" target=\"_blank\">transition
      advocated twenty years ago by Fiona Godlee</a>, from the \u201Cflawed system
      of closed prepublication peer review\u201D to a system of \u201Cpreprint servers
      combined with open commentary\u201D, is still in a very early stage, with preprint
      peer review starting to take off only very recently.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We
      see improvement of peer review as a joint responsibility of all stakeholders
      involved. Each stakeholder needs to make a contribution. We recommend that:</p><ul><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Authors and reviewers</strong> explore the
      interesting new opportunities offered by preprint peer review platforms.</p></li><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Scientific publishers and preprint peer review
      platforms</strong><a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/\"
      target=\"_blank\">register DOIs for open review reports</a> and include links
      in the metadata of these reports to the corresponding journal articles and preprints.</p></li><li
      dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bibliographic databases</strong> provide
      data not only for journal articles, but also for preprints and for open review
      reports linked to journal articles and preprints.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Research funders and institutions</strong> consider using
      this data in research assessments in order to <a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/statement-on-peer-reviewed-publications/\"
      target=\"_blank\">give appropriate recognition</a> to the work done by authors
      and reviewers.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">We end this post by drawing special
      attention to an opportunity individual researchers have to contribute to the
      growth of open peer review. The <a href=\"http://publishyourreviews.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Publish
      Your Reviews initiative</a>, launched today by <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ASAPbio</a> (and co-organized by one of us), calls on researchers
      to publish their review reports alongside the preprint version of an article.
      This offers an easy way to promote openness in peer review. Researchers are

      in quite different contexts and cover a variety of functions.</summary><content

      spring 2020, Italy, like other countries in Europe and around the world, was
      in the midst of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Lockdown measures were
      in place in the entire country in the attempt to limit the spread of the virus.
      In these hard times, Italian public opinion was exposed to hitherto specialistic
      notions of epidemiology such as exponential growth, basic reproduction number,
      respiratory droplets and so on. Experts from medicine and other scientific fields
      had rapidly acquired a new centrality in the media and in government. A scientific-technical
      committee was established to advise the government, while medical doctors and
      scientists were routinely interviewed in newspapers and invited in talk shows.</p><p>In
      this context, on May 2 the newspaper <em>Il Tempo</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.ilcorrieredelgiorno.it/gli-esperti-piu-scarsi-del-mondo-burioni-pregliasco-e-brusaferro/\"
      target=\"_blank\">article</a> bearing the title: \u201CThe poorest experts in
      the world: Burioni, Pregliasco and Brusaferro\u201D.<a id=\"footnote-1-ref\"
      href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> In this article, the <em>scientific reliability</em>
      of several experts taking part in the scientific-technical committee or appearing
      in the media was gauged using the most (in)famous bibliometric indicator, the
      h-index. Experts were ranked and licenses of expertise attributed or discarded
      based on h-index scores. The journalist explained:<br></p><p>The frankly crude
      use of the h-index made in the article attracted much criticism from the Italian
      scientific community (see <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/pattotrasversaleperlascienza/posts/2269510433344522\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.pellegrinoconte.com/2020/05/02/credibilita-scientifica-e-h-index/?fbclid=IwAR3dw1ir3aU2PkTl3Motnla2OgK09OejtRxSZ779Uxe5g3Phd8yT7N-7Da0\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>, sources in Italian). On my part, I was deeply impressed
      by how a specialized notion from bibliometrics <em>percolated</em> in the generalist
      press and was <em>mobilized</em> in public debates on scientific authority and
      trustworthiness of experts. I was aware that bibliometricians and scholars in
      STS were increasingly revealing the performative nature of bibliometric indicators:
      far from being neutral measures, these statistical constructs <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221212\"
      target=\"_blank\">shape the behavior of scientists</a> and deeply <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Franssen/publication/288856380_Evaluation_practices_and_effects_of_indicator_use-a_literature_review/links/5796397508aeb0ffcd058786/Evaluation-practices-and-effects-of-indicator-use-a-literature-review.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">intrude into the epistemic structure of the sciences themselves</a>.
      However, this kind of research had so far mainly focused on intra-scientific
      contexts and practices, with little attention for extra-scientific arenas. Yet,
      the article mentioned above seemed to me a clear example of how academic/scientific
      actors are <em>not</em><em>alone</em> in generating the <em>social</em><em>representation</em>
      of bibliometric indicators: a complete description of the processes of negotiating
      meaning should encompass further actors, such as journalists, and further arenas,
      such as the press.</p><p>I then started a research project aiming at investigating
      the representations and uses of bibliometrics in the press, with the aim of
      developing the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2150-8\"
      target=\"_blank\">previous classifications</a> of relevant actors. I decided
      to focus on the Italian press for two reasons. First, Italy\u2019s research
      evaluation system is heavily based on bibliometric indicators. This system was
      introduced in 2010 as part of a vast reform of the country\u2019s university
      management, which was heavily contested by the Italian academic community. Second,
      Italy lacks a strong indigenous community of bibliometrics experts. In this
      sense, no community could claim an <em>epistemic control</em> of the social
      discourse on bibliometrics in the country. These factors created the conditions
      for newspapers to become a key arena for the discussion of bibliometrics and
      bibliometric indicators and, hence, a perfect viewpoint to observe the collective
      construction of their social representation.</p><p>Using the online archives
      of four major Italian newspapers, I retrieved a corpus of 583 articles, published
      between 1990 and 2020, that mentioned the Journal Impact Factor, the h-index,
      or other bibliometrics-related terms. In this blog post I cannot go into the
      details of this very rich material.<a id=\"footnote-2-ref\" href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a>
      I will try, however, to highlight what I deem to be the three most interesting
      findings and suggest some ideas for further research.</p><h3>Indicators in the
      press between meritocracy, science news, and rankings</h3><p>The first result
      is that the Impact Factor (IF, in the following) started to appear in the Italian
      press in news about <em>scandals in competitions for university chairs</em>.
      In the early 1990s, it become common practice to sum the IF of the journals
      in which scientists published, obtaining an IF-based metric of individual researchers.
      In this way, candidates rejected in competitions had at their disposal a new,
      easily interpretable metric to compare their scientific performance with that
      of the winners and, thus, could reclaim justice. In this sense, the IF started
      its career in the Italian press as a \u201Cjustice device\u201D to <em>promote
      meritocracy</em> in academic recruitment. The following quote is representative
      of the general tone of the news denouncing scandals:<br></p><p>The rhetorical
      use of indicators as objective measures that can fix the perceived endemic clientelism
      of Italian academy grows over the years and reaches its highest intensity in
      the years before the implementation of the 2010 university reform (Figure 1).</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1.png\" alt=\"Fig
      1 petrovich\"><figcaption>Figure 1 - Articles presenting bibliometric indicators
      as a means to promote meritocracy in the Italian university system. Figure adapted
      from the published article.</figcaption></figure><p>This shows that indicators
      were integrated into a <em>meritocracy-centered narrative frame</em> long before
      they were officially enrolled in the Italian research evaluation system.</p><p>The
      second finding, which is particularly relevant for understanding how the press
      contributes to the social construction of scientific facts, is that the Impact
      Factor is frequently used by journalists as a \u201Cquality seal\u201D for science
      news. The IF is presented as a warrant of the <em>scientific reliability</em>
      of the venue of publication, and hence, of the credibility or relevance of the
      science news reported:<br></p><p>Note that no article where the IF plays this
      function mentions the limitations of the indicator, that hence is presented
      as a completely \u201Ctransparent\u201D quality seal, easily interpretable and
      uncontested.</p><p>Interestingly, the IF can be mobilized also to <em>deconstruct</em>
      the validity of research in the news. For instance, the reliability of a study
      allegedly showing the efficacy of homeopathy is contested based on the IF factor
      of the publishing journal, observing that this was \u201Cvery low\u201D compared
      to that of serious scientific journals such as <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>The third
      interesting result concerns the role of <em>amateur bibliometrics</em> in the
      press, that is bibliometrics produced by nonprofessional bibliometricians. The
      h-index arrives in the Italian press in 2008, just three years after its creation
      by Jorge Hirsch. The \u201Cvector\u201D of the indicator was a ranking of Italian
      scientists known as \u201CTop Italian Scientists\u201D (TIS), <a href=\"https://topitalianscientists.org/home\"
      target=\"_blank\">published online by</a> the association Virtual Italian Academy.
      In 2010 and 2011, most of the articles that mentioned the indicator were in
      fact about the TIS. This ranking offered journalists a ranking of individual
      scientists that nicely complemented rankings of universities that started popping
      up in the press in the same years. However, it was the result of a private initiative
      without institutional support. Again, about one out of three of the news about
      the TIS ranking lack any definition of the indicator and less than the half
      report its limitations.</p><p>These three findings show that bibliometric indicators
      in the press occur in different contexts, play a wide range of functions, and
      are integrated into different narrative frames. They appear in debates on academic
      recruitment, but also in the communication of scientific discoveries to the
      public. They can be used to claim justice but also to satisfy the hunger for
      rankings and measuring \u201Cexcellence\u201D.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>The
      next, natural step in the investigation of bibliometrics in the press is to
      understand how the social meaning of indicators is constructed in the press
      of other countries and in other media or press types. It has for instance been
      suggested to me  that Dutch journalists represent the IF differently from their
      Italian colleagues, using it as a \u201Cshorthand\u201D for any bibliometric
      statistics. In this research, I analyzed the generalist press, but there is
      also a specialist press, such as Times Higher Education, or specialist blogs,
      such as <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Madtrics</a>
      and <a href=\"https://www.roars.it/online/who-we-are/\" target=\"_blank\">ROARS
      (Return on Academic Research)</a>, in which the representation of indicators
      may follow different logics. Bibliometrics in press has still lots to tell.<br></p><span

      ill-health and well-being are increasingly recognised as being intimately linked
      to a wide range of environmental and social factors. As such, the ways in which
      researchers approach, understand, and engage with mental health must be broad,
      ranging from the biophysiological mechanisms underpinning brain function, to
      the societal determinants which alter it. The significance of this connection
      has been illustrated by the <a href=\"https://www.isglobal.org/en_GB/-/-es-la-salud-mental-la-pandemia-despues-de-la-covid-19-\"
      target=\"_blank\">effects of COVID lockdowns on mental health</a>\r\nin which:
      fear, sudden changes in daily habits, family roles, domestic violence, work
      burnout, etc. have all palpably impinged on mental well-being. </p><p>Given
      this multiplicity of effects, mental health research should consist of a wide
      diversity of topics, disciplines, approaches, and methods. It also raises the
      question of prioritisation. To what extent should more research efforts be directed
      towards prevention, rehabilitation, or understanding the social determinants
      of health, in comparison with therapeutics or neurosciences? In a collaboration
      between <a href=\"https://www.vinnova.se/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Vinnova</a>
      and the <a href=\"http://cwts.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Science and
      Technology studies (CWTS)</a>, we have undertaken a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/smuyv/\"
      target=\"_blank\">study</a> to begin to understand this diverse research landscape,
      with the aim of opening up conversations about research priorities. Underlying
      our analysis is one motivation: how should research be prioritised for the greatest
      possible reduction of mental ill-health?</p><p>We found broad agreement amongst
      public health researchers and practitioners that mental health is largely determined
      by environmental, social and economic factors. Factors such as one\u2019s work
      environment, the natural and built environment (presence of pollution, transportation
      systems, green spaces, such as parks); one\u2019s relative level of poverty
      and wealth etc. However, what remains an open question, is the extent to which
      current research priorities (at the level of scientific fields) are aligned
      with this understanding. So, do research priorities acknowledge the role of
      the social and environmental contexts in influencing mental well-being? </p><p>To
      address this, we carried out interviews and focus groups of experts as well
      as quantitative analyses of publications on mental health. In so doing we built
      up a picture of what research experts perceive should be prioritised and the
      current priorities manifest within the published research. </p><h3><strong>An
      expert consensus</strong></h3><p>Our focus groups comprised of discussions with
      experts, including clinicians, school psychologists, as well as patient representatives.
      Throughout these exchanges, several key findings emerged with regard to the
      current priorities of mental health research and their potential disconnect
      with the needs of the health and welfare systems. A common theme from the interviews
      was a need for systemic research on the social and environmental determinants
      of mental health. In particular, experts called for research that is more focused
      on:</p><ul><li><strong>Health systems </strong>and <strong>health services</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Psychosocial
      interventions</strong>, rather than only biomedical and pharmaceutical, interventions,
      as well as diagnostic classifications </li></ul><ul><li>A perspective of mental
      health that focuses on the <strong>entire life-course, with special attention
      to childhood and adolescence</strong></li></ul><p>These points highlight the
      conclusion of experts that mental health research has become focused on decontextualized
      individual and biomedical approaches. Further, experts argued that the reason
      for this focus on biomedical psychiatry and neuroscience, were incumbent authority,
      recognition, and reward structures within academia, which prioritise funding
      for \u2018novel and highly technical\u2019 approaches. More contextualized forms
      of research, focused on social determinants were on the other hand felt to be
      devalued and under-prioritized.  </p><h3><strong>Mapping research priorities
      from publication data</strong></h3><p>Alongside this qualitative data, we documented
      the current distribution of research for mental health across disciplines and
      topics using publication data (Web of Science) with an <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tim5920/viz/MentalHealthtool/MHtool\"
      target=\"_blank\">interactive visualization interface</a> that allows users
      to compare research efforts by specific countries, organizations and funders.

      target=\"_blank\">interactive visualization interface</a> for data on other
      countries, organizations or funders. </figcaption></figure><p></p><p>The first
      visualization provides information on the relative amount of research that a
      given unit (e.g. a country) publishes in certain disciplines, as illustrated
      in Figure 1. with Germany, United Kingdom and Sweden given as examples. Publication
      data shows that psychiatry-related disciplines, neurosciences, and biomedicine
      constitute the largest share of research, with around 60%-75% of all research.
      It also confirms experts\u2019 perceptions that there is relatively little mental
      health research in social science, public health and policy, and in healthcare
      systems, with around 10-20% of publications altogether. According to stakeholders,
      this low percentage is due to the relative lack of academic prestige of qualitative
      and implementation research among health funders and evaluation systems. However,
      Figure 1 also shows that Sweden (and the Nordic countries if you explore the
      interactive visualisation) has a more balanced portfolio than countries such
      as Germany or the UK. </p><p>The second visualization allows users to compare
      the relative number of publications of a specific country, organization or funder
      over 280 research topics related to mental health, as illustrated in Figure
      2. With this more detailed description, it is possible to explore particular
      specialisation patterns \u2013 thus spotting research strengths or gaps for
      a certain country or organization. For example, we were able to see that Sweden
      is relatively specialised in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that Denmark is relatively
      more focused on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, while the US is more active
      in autism research. More interestingly, the mappings also show the specific
      social determinants of mental health studied, e.g. the relationship between
      racial inequality and mental health, inequalities, school bullying, job insecurity
      or homelessness. </p><figure><a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/shared/WPD8R6KMF?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link\"

      deliberation on research priorities</strong><br></h3><p> Our hope is that the
      comparisons provided by the visualization tools can support deliberations between
      policymakers and experts so as to rebalance mental health research in ways more
      effective in reducing the amount of mental ill-health, as well in promoting
      mental well-being. </p><p>Redressing these imbalances in mental health research
      has the opportunity to better countless lives. Research funders and policymakers,
      have a responsibility to reflect on whether or not current research priorities
      truly serve the needs of society. <br><br><em></em></p><p><em>We thank the editor

      data-driven, and so is the management, communication, and evaluation of research.
      The area of research intelligence is fuelled by big data analytics and provides
      new prospects for assisted decision-making on funding opportunities, publishing
      venues and next generation metrics. Such types of analysis are based on research
      products (such as articles and datasets) and by-products (such as metadata about
      funding). Of a total of \u20AC17.5 billion annual investment in Dutch research
      and development, 30% is funded and 34% performed by public institutions. It
      is therefore essential that research intelligence undertaken in these institutions
      is done so in accordance with scholarly values. This is all the more urgent
      when more and more big publishers are moving <a href=\"https://eua.eu/resources/expert-voices/250:safeguarding-academic-and-digital-sovereignty-a-model-for-action.html\"

      are glad that the Dutch universities adopted the Guiding Principles for Open
      Research Information in the Summer of 2021. This should now lead to in-house
      application, as well as adoption in commercial systems. This is a crucial step
      in the move toward more open (information about) research. All research performing
      organisations that rely on public spending should provide leadership in this

      does responsible research evaluation look like when it comes to societal value?
      This blog post provides four practical recommendations.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>In the global research evaluation
      community, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of responsible
      evaluation. The current situation, with an emphasis on quantitative metrics,
      does not do justice to diversity between scientific fields, to different roles
      of researchers, or to the societal value of research. Moreover, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article-abstract/25/2/161/2362680\"
      target=\"_blank\">studies</a> have shown that researchers adjust their activities
      in anticipation of evaluations. So far, there has been little awareness for
      effects on the system level (see <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/520429a\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto for research metrics</a>). </p><p>The debate
      about responsible evaluation focuses mainly on indicators of citation impact,
      such as journal impact factors or the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/halt-the-h-index\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hirsch index</a>. This blog post explores the requirements
      for a responsible approach to evaluating the societal value of science.</p><p>Over
      the past few decades, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/323/6220452\"
      target=\"_blank\">a number of tools and methods</a> have been developed to evaluate
      the societal value of science. Society urgently needs science to guide sustainability
      transitions, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and to decrease global economic
      inequality. High expectations from publicly funded research give rise to a need
      for assessing the societal benefits of science. Does scientific research actually
      deliver the societal value that it promises or that public funders expect? </p><p>Available
      methods use qualitative or quantitative data to make the use, uptake or impact
      of scientific knowledge in society visible. A promising avenue is to focus on
      the process rather than eventual impact. Societal value comes in many different
      forms, such as improved public health, economic growth or better education.
      Such diversity makes its measurement and comparability highly unfeasible. Moreover,
      the impact of scientific knowledge often develops over longer time periods,
      and is influenced by many factors beyond the control of the researchers involved.
      It becomes more attractive to focus the evaluation on the immediate response
      in society, or on the interactions between research and societal stakeholders
      as these are instances that are more concrete and verifiable than broadly defined
      or large-scale societal impact. These responses and interactions are then taken
      as pre-conditions of impact.</p><p>How can the available methods be applied
      to evaluate societal value in a responsible way? Here we provide four recommendations.&nbsp;</p><h3>1.
      Choose methods that match the purpose of evaluation</h3><ol></ol><ol></ol><p>A
      key consideration in planning your research evaluation is what you want to achieve
      with it. Is it mainly an accountability exercise, to illustrate that investments
      have resulted into societal uptake and use? In that case you may want to focus
      on empirical evidence of impact, for example using the <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/publications/estimating-the-economic-benefits-from-medical-research-in-the-uk/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Monetization method</a>. Or do you want to <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-iv-accountability-and-learning\"
      target=\"_blank\">support a learning process</a>, in order to improve strategies
      for societal impact? In that case, it will be more helpful to make an inventory
      of the key audiences in society and investigate how they respond to the research
      products of the unit of evaluation, using altmetrics, for example.<br></p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/toolbox.jpg\" alt=\"Toolbox\"><figcaption>There\u2019s
      nothing like a well-equipped toolbox!</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Choose methods
      that fit the research      context </h3><p>Given the heterogeneity of research
      practices, it is key to <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\"
      target=\"_blank\">tailor the evaluation approach to the disciplinary and organizational
      context</a> of the research unit under evaluation. While patents may be a meaningful
      indicator of impact in a biotechnology department, advisory reports will be
      more important in an institute for macro-economics. If the evaluation context
      allows, it can be useful to design a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10961-017-9607-7\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018theory-of-change\u2019</a>. This is a causal model representing
      the desired impacts, the intermediate \u2018outcomes\u2019 and the immediate
      \u2018outputs\u2019 that can lead to those impacts. Building a theory-of-change,
      preferably in co-creation with stakeholders, will help distinguishing relevant
      audiences inside and outside of the research setting that will need to be reached
      in order to generate any impact. Analyses of collaboration networks or social
      media interactions can then help to explore to what extent these audiences respond
      to research products or how they interact with the researchers.&nbsp;</p><h3>3.
      Combine qualitative and      quantitative data</h3><ol></ol><p>Qualitative and
      quantitative data can both provide insights into the dynamics of generating
      value from scientific research. The Leiden Manifesto argues to use quantitative
      indicators only to support qualitative, expert assessment. In line with this,
      we recommend using quantitative analysis of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04251\"
      target=\"_blank\">digital responses</a> or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3152/095820211X12941371876742\"
      target=\"_blank\">productive interactions</a> to <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-iii-mixing-methods-for-evaluating-research\"
      target=\"_blank\">start a conversation</a> rather than to end one. And to consider
      the use of qualitative data from interviews, focus-groups or interactive workshops
      in addition. One of the tools that we use in Leiden, <a href=\"https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/79599\"
      target=\"_blank\">Area-Based Connectedness</a>, focuses on the connections of
      a research area with industry, policy or other societal domains. Instead of
      \u201Cmeasuring\u201D the direct connections of a research unit with societal
      actors, this method provides evidence of the connectedness of research areas
      in which the unit publishes. In this way, it indicates the potential societal
      <em>relevance</em>\r\nrather than the particular <em>impact</em>&nbsp;it generates.
      We have experienced that this kind of information can help both research units
      and evaluation committees to understand the interactions between research activities
      and society. It can form a fruitful basis for conversations either to improve
      research strategies or to formulate evaluative conclusions. </p><h3>4. Consider
      the theoretical assumptions of your evaluation method</h3><ol></ol><p>In a <a
      href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/323/6220452\" target=\"_blank\">recent
      review</a>, Jorrit Smit and Laurens Hessels show that the available methods
      vary not only in terms of the methodological approach but also in terms of their
      theoretical assumptions about societal value, the actors involved and the interaction
      mechanisms to produce this value. Some methods, such as <a href=\"https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJTM.2001.002988\"
      target=\"_blank\">Science and Technology Human Capital</a>, for example, hold
      a linear view on knowledge exchange and perceive knowledge users merely as recipients
      of knowledge. Other methods, such as <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article-abstract/24/4/440/1518936\"
      target=\"_blank\">ASIRPA</a>, are based on a cyclical model, emphasizing the
      feedback mechanisms between the production and the application of knowledge.
      There are also methods, such as <a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-4505-10-21\"
      target=\"_blank\">Contribution Mapping</a>, that follow a co-production model,
      an almost equal perspective that allocates more agency to users and intermediaries.
      Similarly, the new proposal of \u201C<a href=\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24427\"
      target=\"_blank\">heterogeneous couplings</a>\u201D introduces more interactive
      science-society perspectives in the altmetrics and social media metrics toolset.
      Each method has its own merits, as it will highlight particular achievements
      or mechanisms. For this reason, it is often fruitful to combine different methods.
      One key consideration for choosing methods will be the data required. However,
      we recommend research managers and evaluators to not only consider practical
      constraints, but also the alignment between the theoretical foundations of an
      evaluation method and their own convictions about the way scientific research
      generates value in society. </p><h3>To conclude</h3><p>The recommendations presented
      here are grounded on an interactive understanding of the creation of societal
      value, assuming that the value of science to society is produced in mutual interactions
      between academia and society. They address a rather broad audience, as research
      evaluations are typically designed by collectives of researchers, policy makers,
      research managers and advisory committees. These four recommendations can help
      them to design suitable evaluation approaches. We do not believe in blueprints
      of how to evaluate the societal value of scientific projects, programs, or organisations.
      Rather we hope to give some guidance in tailoring evaluation approaches, in
      order for them to support learning and accountability effectively.</p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>Photo

      \                                               <p>How can academic research
      systems enable more diverse profiles and career paths for academics? How can
      research assessment better recognize quality, content, creativity, and social
      relevance of research? Can academics be better rewarded for individual and team-based
      contributions, where appropriate? These were some of the questions at stake
      at the <a href=\"https://recognitionrewards.nl/2022/02/11/a-recap-of-the-recognition-rewards-festival-2/\"
      target=\"_blank\">second annual Recognition and Rewards Programme event</a>
      in the Netherlands on 4 February 2022, moved online due to coronavirus. </p><p>Combining
      elements of bottom-up and top-down coordination, the Recognition and Rewards
      initiative is a coalition of research funders, universities, university medical
      centers, and public research institutes that aim to reform and diversify academic
      career and research quality assessment. Since the publication of the position
      paper, <a href=\"https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/recognitionandrewards/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Position-paper-Room-for-everyone%e2%80%99s-talent.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Room for everyone\u2019s talent: towards a new balance in
      the recognition and rewards of academics</a> in 2019, Dutch Universities have
      pursued local action plans and some have begun implementing changes in pursuit
      of Recognition and Rewards\u2019 vision. </p><p>As a nationally coordinated
      effort, Recognition and Rewards is one of the first of its kind (see also initiatives
      in <a href=\"https://www.uhr.no/en/front-page-carousel/nor-cam-a-toolbox-for-recognition-and-rewards-in-academic-careers.5780.aspx\"
      target=\"_blank\">Norway</a> and <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/case-study/responsible-research-network-finland/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Finland</a>), providing a fascinating natural experiment on
      what happens when large-scale reforms of a research system are introduced. Being
      one of the first into unchartered territory though means the Dutch research
      system has some \u2018first mover disadvantages\u2019, as those investing in
      reforms lack existing stocks of knowledge and experience to inform their change
      efforts. Alongside bottom-up changes being implemented locally, the Recognition
      and Rewards programme is seeking to build shared infrastructure to guide and
      monitor individual changes and draw out common lessons. Events such as the annual
      festival are one such example of infrastructure, as they provide an important
      moment to pause and reflect on challenges and more generally to forge communities
      of practice that share knowledge on common challenges that cut across organizations.
      </p><p>The Festival itself took place over a day, and consisted of roundtable
      discussions by senior stakeholders and parallel stream workshops put on by different
      research system actors. Our own team hosted a session on the challenges of implementing
      complex changes in organizations, using fictional vignettes of university leaders
      introducing narrative CVs and portfolio assessment tools. Clearly such interventions
      cannot \u2018resolve\u2019 complex issues around which different meanings and
      conflicts of interest emerge. Occasions such as online workshops, can though
      provide opportunities for common challenges to be surfaced, discussed, and acknowledged,
      thereby supporting learning and networking among different actors in the research
      system as they approach their respective change efforts. </p><p>Broadening out,
      with its Recognition and Rewards programme of reforms, Dutch Universities have
      a unique opportunity not only to be at the forefront of assessment reforms,
      but also to cultivate communities of practice and build shared knowledge about
      implementing, scaling and sustaining reforms from which others can benefit.
      Building this knowledge is not easy, as it involves dedicating potentially scarce
      resources to evaluating and monitoring interventions and being open to sharing
      findings with one\u2019s perceived competitors and opening oneself up to scrutiny
      from the wider world. But these are costs that should be worth bearing. </p><p>Alongside
      the Dutch efforts, there are other signs of emerging cross-national knowledge
      infrastructure to inform and guide academic institutions pursuing assessment
      reforms. The Recognition and Reward Festival itself took place on the same day
      as the <a href=\"https://osec2022.eu/program/\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Open
      Science European Conference (OSEC) 2022</a> focusing on research assessment
      reforms in the European Union. 160 organizations have signed up to declare interest
      in the <a href=\"https://sciencebusiness.net/news/france-helps-brussels-move-ahead-disruptive-plan-research-assessment#?wt_zmc=\"
      target=\"_blank\">European Commission\u2019s action plan</a> to implement research
      assessment reforms. CWTS, Leiden University, where the three of us work, is
      currently partnering with the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment
      (DORA) on <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/project-tara/\" target=\"_blank\">three
      year project</a> funded by Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and
      Peter Baldwin, to build community resources to support assessment reform practitioners
      internationally, including building a toolkit and an online dashboard to display
      and visualize information around novel assessment activities in the context
      of hiring, promotion and tenure decisions. The dashboard will complement an
      existing raft of resources that the DORA website has established in recent times,
      including case studies, blogs and <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/70929\"
      target=\"_blank\">tools to develop change management</a>. Professional research
      management associations like International Network of Research Management Societies
      (INORMS) Research Evaluation Group (REG) have also been actively developing
      resources to guide organizational change, including the <a href=\"https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/21655-scope-guide-v9-1636013361_cc-by.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">SCOPE Framework</a>.</p><p>Much is happening. Yet, two overlapping
      research communities that have been surprisingly quiet on research assessment
      reforms are the fields of sociology of science and the multi-disciplinary social
      science field of research evaluation. This is alarming, as a rigorous, theoretically
      informed academic knowledge base about novel assessment tools and practices
      is urgently needed. Participating in the Recognition and Rewards Festival it
      struck us these are just the kinds of collective engagements in which such a
      knowledge base should be playing a valuable role. Given quite dramatic changes
      are underway in core problem areas of their field \u2013 research assessment
      - our message to colleagues and peers in the sociology of science and research
      evaluation is clear: it\u2019s time for us to step up.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Alex

      \                                               <p>Whether in publications,
      seminar Q&As, or on Twitter, scientists tend to disagree. Although many topics
      have broad consensus\u2014human-caused climate change and the link between smoking
      and cancer being but two\u2014even the most settled knowledge was at once the
      subject of debate. The history of science is littered with such examples. The

      Affair</a>, Einstein and Bohr\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2\"

      target=\"_blank\">theory of tectonic drift</a>\r\nare but few examples of disagreements
      with great consequence. Even now, debates continue over topics ranging from
      the value of <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-debate-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding-20190808/\"
      target=\"_blank\">the hubble constant</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215014256\"
      target=\"_blank\">evolutionary origins and role of dance</a>.</p><p>When it
      comes to disagreement in science, one thing is obvious: it\u2019s everywhere.
      Yet, the true extent of disagreement is still not well known. Countless theories
      posit the central role of disagreement to epistemic progress, yet empirical
      evidence is often limited to case studies, ethnographies, and historical examples,
      which while immensely valuable, can\u2019t be generalized across all of science.
      For decades though, this was the only kind of data available. Fortunately, the
      increasing availability of scientific full-text has allowed newfound progress,
      making it possible to study disagreement <em>quantitatively</em> across all
      of science. </p><h3><strong>A new approach to study disagreement</strong></h3><p>In
      <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/72737\" target=\"_blank\">our study
      published in eLife</a>, we develop a novel approach to identify disagreements
      from citation sentences. We define disagreement in two ways. The first is <em>paper-level</em>,
      the most clear-cut case of direct and explicit disagreement from one paper to
      another over any aspect of its findings, interpretations, or design. The second
      is <em>community-level, </em>such that a paper signals controversy and debate
      within the broader field. These two types of disagreement are exemplified in
      the following cases:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Paper-level:</em></strong> \u201CWe
      find that coffee does not cause cancer, contrary to the finding of &lt;ref&gt;
      that coffee does cause cancer.\u201D</li><li><strong><em>Community-level:</em></strong>
      \u201CThere remains controversy in the scientific literature over whether or
      not coffee is associated with an increased risk of cancer &lt;refs&gt;.\u201D</li></ul><p>By
      considering both of these types, we are able to capture the full extent of scientific
      disagreement. Working from our definition, we develop a novel, cue-word based
      strategy for identifying citation sentences as cases of disagreement. For example,
      words like \u201C<em>challenged\u201D</em>&nbsp;and \u201C<em>conflict\u201D</em>
      can signal disagreement, especially when accompanied by words relating to objects
      of disagreement (e.g., results of methods). We devise 65 queries, and through
      extensive manual validation, select only the best to form a single disagreement
      indicator. This final indicator is precise, easy-to-scale (implemented in SQL),
      and wholly transparent.<strong><br></strong></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Fig1_d_murray_2_2022-01-17-124001_lqkm.png\"
      alt=\"Fig1 d murray 2\"><figcaption>Figure 1: Rates of disagreement across disciplines</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>A
      complex landscape of disagreement</strong><br></h3><p>Using our indicator, we
      search for disagreements across the citation sentences of nearly 4 million articles
      indexed in Elsevier\u2019s <em>ScienceDirect </em>database. What this immediately
      reveals is that disagreement is highest in the social sciences, and lowest in
      fields like physics and computer science (Figure 1). This almost exactly mirrors
      Auguste Comte\u2019s \u201C<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_the_sciences\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hierarchy of Sciences</a>\u201D, a theoretical model for organizing
      disciplines. Fields at the bottom of the hierarchy, like physics, can postulate
      simple and general theories, a task that becomes increasingly difficult moving
      up the hierarchy towards the social sciences. Yet as we dig deeper at the level
      of sub-fields, a more complex picture emerges.</p><figure><a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_2_scientific_disagreement.png\"

      broken down by the high-level field and notable meso-fields highlighted with
      journals within them.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Examining 817 sub-fields
      (Figure 2), we see how the \u201Chierarchy of sciences\u201D begins to break
      down. Within the Biomedical Sciences, disagreement is highest in fields studying
      the social aspects of healthcare. In the Life Sciences, Paleontologists end
      up disagreeing more akin to sociologists than to their natural science counterparts,
      reflecting the inherent challenges of geological records. An <a href=\"https://app.vosviewer.com/researchlandscape/?json=data/wos_1613_disagreement.json\"
      target=\"_blank\">interactive tool </a>published alongside our study allows
      anyone the opportunity to dig into our data and uncover the heterogeneity of
      disagreement.</p><p>So while it\u2019s true that disagreement is everywhere,
      we demonstrate that it is not uniformly distributed. Simplistic models, such
      as the hierarchy of sciences, cannot explain the complex landscape of disagreement
      observed in our study. Instead, the roots of disagreement are multi-faceted.
      Individual scientists disagree over differences in approach, interpretation,
      and background. Their likelihood to disagree is, in turn, the result of the
      kinds of evidence, methodology, and culture that varies across disciplines.
      Accounting for these many factors is essential for a better understanding of
      disagreement.</p><h3><strong>Setting a path forward</strong></h3><p>Our study
      offers a glimpse into <em>where</em> disagreement happens in science, but it
      also sets a stage for addressing questions such as <em>what causes disagreements?</em>
      and <em>why do they matter</em>? We make some progress on each, finding evidence
      of social factors at play (e.g., disagreement focused on recent, rather than
      past papers) and the implications towards impact (e.g., papers that disagree
      receive more citations). These results are preliminary, but they provide the
      foundation for addressing more and more consequential questions about scientific
      disagreement.</p><p>One of the key questions is the normative one: <em>is disagreement
      good for science? </em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039368113000162\"
      target=\"_blank\">Existing theories</a> argue that disagreement forces researchers
      to collect new evidence and reckon with differences in worldview, pushing knowledge
      forward. But disagreements can also erupt over simple <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039368119300937\"
      target=\"_blank\">miscommunications</a>, causing progress to stall.</p><p>Whether
      or not disagreement is necessary for advancement, it is clear that it\u2019s
      ubiquitous, touching nearly every aspect of scientific activity. As scientometricians,
      it is necessary that we better understand disagreement, not only to build stronger
      theories of scientific progress, but also to inform policies and practices that
      take into account the role of disagreement in science.</p><p>Ironically, a science
      of scientific disagreement requires consensus\u2014clear definitions and methodologies
      are needed to make progress. Our study sets up a foundation, one that can be
      collectively built upon to address this challenge. The method we introduce is
      robust, transparent, and open to anyone to improve; to support further progress,

      Kochetkov is PhD candidate at CWTS. In this post, he gives an update on Priority-2030,
      a new excellence initiative in the Russian higher education sector. He also
      makes some reflections on the role of this experience in the global context
      of higher education reform.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Since the mid-1990s, excellence
      initiatives in higher education have become part of the world's political discourse.
      Many governments have spent billions of euros in an effort to transform national
      higher education systems and achieve the so-called \"world class\". The effectiveness
      of these programs is a subject of scientific and policy debate now.</p><p>Russia
      launched several reform programs, the most famous of which is <a href=\"https://5top100.ru/en/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Project 5-100</a> (5top100), which lasted from 2013 to 2020.
      The goal of the program was to place five Russian universities in the top 100
      world university rankings. Formally, the goal was not achieved, but many experts
      noted the positive effect of the project for Russian higher education (although,
      of course, there were also many critics). In May 2021, the Russian government
      announced the launch of the new excellence initiative <a href=\"https://priority2030.ru/en\">Priority-2030</a>.
      I think the Russian experience is interesting in the global context of higher
      education reform.</p><p>The Priority 2030 program is a unified program not limited
      by territorial, sectoral, or other principles. The Program is aimed at involving
      a wide range of participants; therefore, it provides several tracks for entering.
      There are four groups of entry criteria:</p><ul><li>The first group of criteria
      characterizes the scale of the university and thereby assesses the potential
      for its contribution to the socio-economic and scientific-technological development
      of the country or a specific region (quantitative criteria).</li><li>The second
      group of criteria takes into account the specifics of the universities with
      a creative focus and is developed specifically for such entities. For the first
      time, the program provides special conditions of entry for the universities
      specialized in arts.</li><li>In accordance with the third group of entry criteria,
      universities that meet two criteria from the first group (scale) can participate
      in the Priority 2030 program as candidates. To obtain candidate status, the
      university must commit to meeting the first group of entry criteria no later
      than two years after the selection. Besides, the government body of the region,
      on the territory of which the university is located, and (or) the federal executive
      body, and (or) the industrial organization must commit themselves during this
      period of time to provide additional financial support for the implementation
      of the university development program in the amount of not less than the minimum
      size of the basic part of the grant.</li><li>The fourth group of criteria is
      focused on increasing the potential of universities that meet at least two criteria
      from the first group through the merger with other universities and (or) scientific
      organizations.</li></ul><p>It should be emphasized that the listed requirements
      are minimal: they are necessary for the opportunity to participate in the selection,
      but the success depends on the ambitiousness of the goals, objectives, planned
      qualitative and quantitative commitments that the university undertakes as part
      of its development program, as well as on elaboration of the tools to achieve
      them. University development programs are based on strategic projects, usually
      of an interdisciplinary nature.</p><p>The competitive procedure in 2021 was
      carried out in two stages. At the first stage, 106 universities were selected
      to receive the basic part of the grant (100 million rubles per year, or approximately
      1.17 million euros). 54 universities continued to fight for the special part
      of the grant on two tracks: research leadership and territorial / industry leadership.
      As a result, 46 universities were selected to receive the special part of the
      grant. The beneficiaries were divided into three groups based on the Program
      Council's assessments. The winners of the first group, in addition to the base
      part of the grant, will receive 994.5 million rubles by the end of 2022 (11.6
      million euros), the second 426.2 million rubles (5 million euros), the third
      142.1 million rubles (1.7 million euros). There is a procedure for the rotation
      of universities; the next selection will take place in 2023.</p><p>Priority
      2030 is not just a continuation of the Project 5-100. The design of the program
      takes into account not only the best practices of previous initiatives but also
      their shortcomings. In particular, the program provides:</p><ul><li>Rejection
      of global university rankings as a basis for evaluation</li><li>Engagement of
      as wide a range of participants as possible to avoid the Matthew effect on the
      national higher education system</li><li>Rotation of program participants to
      maintain a competitive environment</li></ul><p>So here we observe the same shift
      from university rankings to national and local relevance, and partnerships with
      the industry that we saw <a href=\"https://www.scholarlyassessmentreports.org/articles/10.29024/sar.15/\"
      target=\"_blank\">earlier in China</a>. </p><p>Taking into account the number
      of participants (106), the Program is the most massive in the history of Russian
      higher education reforms and is comparable only to the Chinese <a href=\"https://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cedu/ceduproject211.php\"
      target=\"_blank\">Plan 211</a> in the world. At the same time, there are those
      who believe that the project will negatively affect the universities that do
      not participate in the Program. Probably, such concerns will always accompany
      project initiatives.</p><p>Another concern is that the amount of government
      funding will not be sufficient for the real transformation of universities.
      It is difficult to disagree with this. The Program can be successful only under
      the condition of maximum involvement of business and regions in the process
      of university development. Such involvement implies attracting extra-budgetary
      funding sources to finance development and transformation programs (I consider
      the lack of such sources to be the main problem of Russian higher education
      at the current stage). Only time will tell whether the participants of the Program
      will cope with this difficult task.</p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>This text

      results is a crucial part of our work at CWTS and essential for interacting
      with our audience. Consolidating and enriching our knowledge of the Tableau
      software in a two-day advanced course was one step in that direction. Here,
      we share some of the experiences and lessons learned.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">A large part
      of our daily work at CWTS consists of collecting, analyzing and presenting data
      - be it in <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research\" target=\"_blank\">our research</a>,
      for <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects\" target=\"_blank\">institutional
      projects</a>, or for our <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">research
      agency</a>. Over the years, CWTS has paid particular attention to developing
      conversational and participatory approaches to understand science and its dynamics.
      One way of doing so is to use tools that enable communication with stakeholders
      and that involve researchers, research managers, policy makers, funders, and
      other stakeholders in the dialogue about science. Pertinent examples may be
      the interface for the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
      Ranking</a>, or the VOSviewer software with a <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent update</a> that facilitates sharing network maps online
      - very much in step with <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open\"
      target=\"_blank\">calls for more interactive and accessible visualizations</a>.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">As a consequence, our work revolves a lot around questions such
      as: How can I optimize the way I am sharing my work? How can I make best use
      of tools to provide more insights? And of course, we are aware that expanding
      one's toolkit can open up entirely new possibilities. When it became clear that
      the reporting of results was one aspect in which we could be more advanced,
      we took a closer look at Tableau. </p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Using Tableau at CWTS</h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">You could think of <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/why-tableau/what-is-tableau\"
      target=\"_blank\">Tableau</a> as a very advanced form of Excel - but the comparison
      is not really accurate. As a \u201Cvisual analytics platform\u201D, Tableau
      focuses on making data more accessible to people, especially by means of visualization.
      This was what we were looking for - a solution that could facilitate interactive
      dashboards and dynamic, tailored reports. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Two years ago,
      a team of colleagues from CWTS had followed a Tableau Fundamentals training
      to learn the basics of Tableau. We put this new knowledge into practice right
      away - for example in a project around the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/monitoring-the-dissemination-of-covid-19-related-scientific-publications-in-online-media\"
      target=\"_blank\">uptake of online media attention</a> for Covid-19 publications.
      Recently, we wanted to improve our Tableau skills further, so we took an advanced
      course in Tableau. Besides the more technical aspects, taking the course was
      an opportunity to reflect on our work processes and on how we create visualizations
      more generally - but also on how we acquire such new skills.</p><h3>Consolidating
      our knowledge </h3><p>During the two days of training, we revisited fundamental
      Tableau concepts, including special calculations, the order of operations, and
      data modeling. (Apparently, getting those concepts right is crucial for a smooth
      workflow in Tableau. It\u2019s worthwhile investing a bit in understanding them!)
      We were also acquainted with new practices using our own data models (e.g.,
      building advanced visuals and validating calculations).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When
      it came to thinking about visualizations in the course, one lesson hit home
      in particular: You have to consider the message that you want to communicate
      through the graphs produced in Tableau. Ultimately, this comes down to thinking
      visually, not so much from the perspective of a reading, but an exploring user.
      </p><p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of the second day of the training, we worked on
      an exercise in which we were asked to use a table (Table 1) that contains indicators
      that we commonly use at CWTS and redesign it by using pencil and paper and a
      splash of creativity. After drawing the visualization on a piece of paper, it
      was time to build this visual in Tableau. At the end of the practice, we shared
      our work and discussed some of our attempts (see Figures 1-3). <br></p><figure><img

      alt=\"Tableau figure3\"><figcaption>Figure 3. A suggestion from our trainer:
      Pareto Chart.</figcaption></figure><h3>On learning a new tool</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">What
      is the best way to \u2018learn\u2019 a new tool? Of course, a thorough course
      is a good starting point. However, nothing beats \u201Clearning by doing\u201D.
      You have to \u2018struggle\u2019 through the whole process yourself, repeatedly.
      Also, we noticed that in the time between the basic and the advanced course
      (1.5 years), the knowledge acquired got lost quite easily without continuous
      practice. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The complexity of the data that we use (working
      with publication ids with different affiliations, different authors names, etc.)
      can be a challenge.<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\"> A brilliant team at CWTS</a> is dedicated to evaluate the
      data collected and aims to provide a consistent and transparent curation. So
      the preparation of the data is done in-house. However, creating relationships
      and using joins in Tableau can be rather tricky, especially when you are used
      to the transparency of scripts e.g., in SQL. After all, you don\u2019t want
      to \u2018lose\u2019 any data!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Related to that, we found that
      it requires some time to appreciate the benefits of Tableau when you have relied
      on other tools for a long time. This is part of the learning process itself
      and requires some reflection on your processes and workflows. In the end, you
      have to find out how and where to fit in Tableau.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One attractive
      element is the possibility to publish the dashboards online via Tableau online
      or <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/\" target=\"_blank\">Tableau
      public</a> and to allow the reader to become an active user. They can interact
      with the visualizations (e.g. choose a certain filter and/or dig into more detail).
      However, what is important to keep in mind is that we need to be very explicit
      in what we want to show and to label the titles, etc. adequately to make it
      comprehensive and intuitive for the readers.  </p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Following
      this (online) training was quite intense but most certainly valuable for our
      organization. Learning new possibilities to visualize our data allows us to
      think critically about dashboards for our audience.</p><p>However, having the
      many options offered by Tableau also makes you rethink your way of working -
      how you prepare data, how much time you spend on visualizing results, up to
      the delivery of results and visualizations. While previously, we relied a lot
      on reports delivered as Pdfs or Word documents, we may now as well share interactive
      dashboards. Here is where a good understanding of how visualizations work best
      comes in handy. </p><p>Working with Tableau is not a solitary exercise and does
      not only involve the maker and the audience. It is a matter of teamwork as well:
      acquiring skills in the specific context of our work requires transferring and
      exchanging knowledge among colleagues. Other options are to work with templated
      solutions for recurring problems. This notion was captured very nicely by one
      colleague: \u201Cthe most important asset of the training was to get together.
      It will lead to more synchronized approaches and visuals\u201D.<br><br><em>Photo

      this blog post we examine academic funding acknowledgements (FAs), and compare

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>Funding
      data (and the funding database)</h3><p>Funding acknowledgements are a familiar
      component of scholarly publications. In most cases, authors use this segment
      of the publication to list any grants, programs or other forms of financial
      support that made the research possible.  In some cases, authors also use this
      space to express gratitude for any personal support they have received.</p><p>For
      the uninitiated, these snippets of text may seem innocuous, but in fact they
      reveal the behind-the-scenes workings of scholarly publishing.  They are useful
      for funders who have a vested interest in accurately tracking the research output
      of their grants.  They are also of interest to readers who are interested in
      which funding entities are responsible for what research.</p><p>Within CWTS\u2019
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\">A-team</a>,
      we have developed the structure of the so-called funding database, the aim of
      which is to create a taxonomy of funding organizations, while also enabling
      more research into this nascent field. This in-house database is based on Web
      of Science funding acknowledgment data, which itself is based on processing
      the acknowledgment text sections and extracting the relevant funder names and
      grants. After some CWTS preprocessing, these data can then be used to map the
      previously opaque support network which underlies the scholarly publishing space.
      </p><h3>The new player in town: Dimensions</h3><p>In addition to Web of Science,
      a new source of funding data has become available in recent years: Dimensions.
      Part of the ensemble of Digital Science products, Dimensions uses a comprehensive
      methodology to acquire funding data. According to its <a href=\"https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000018854-how-does-dimensions-make-the-connections-between-funders-grants-and-publications-\"
      target=\"_blank\">website</a>, Dimensions employs a three-pronged approach to
      creating the connection between publications and grants:</p><ol><li>Mining and
      extracting the funding acknowledgement section</li><li>Receiving information
      directly from funders</li><li>Extracting connections from PubMed and CrossRef</li></ol><p>Furthermore,
      Dimensions identifies funding organizations using <a href=\"https://grid.ac/\"
      target=\"_blank\">GRID</a>, Digital Science\u2019s immense global database of
      over 100,000 research-related organizations. The differing methodology combined
      with the huge scale of GRID make Dimensions a potentially interesting source
      of funding data, which could serve to complement or provide quality control
      on the already existing database.</p><h3>Case study: the NWO</h3><p>In order
      to compare the Dimensions funding data to our own, we examined the research
      output and related grant data of the largest funder in the Netherlands, NWO.
      As noted on the NWO <a href=\"https://www.nwo-i.nl/en/nwo-institutes-organisation/about-nwo-i/attachment/nwo-i_organogram_mrt2018-2-2/\"
      target=\"_blank\">website,</a>\r\nthe NWO-I (the institutes organization of
      the NWO) manages 9 national research institutes, and there are an additional
      8 suborganizations under the NWO.</p><p>To properly compare the two databases,
      we need to make sure that we are making a fair comparison. Web of Science only
      began collecting (or at least making public) funding data from 2008 onwards,
      and has collected pre-2008 acknowledgments only marginally. Dimensions on the
      other hand has no such cut-off point in their collection. The comparison can
      be seen in Figure 1.  </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure2.jpeg\"
      data-image=\"21952\" alt=\"Count of funding acknowledgements in each database
      by year.\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      1: Count of funding acknowledgements in each database by year.</span><br>To
      make the comparison sensible, we limit our comparison to publications from 2008
      and onwards.  Additionally, we only include publications which are indexed in
      both databases, since many publications (and thus funding acknowledgements)
      are unique to each database, as shown in Figure 2. The databases are connected
      through stable identifiers, namely DOI and PubMedID. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure3_2021-12-15-152641_nmzu.png\"

      2. Comparison between Web of Science and Dimensions from 2008 onwards (*Unique
      number of funding acknowledgements from each database, from 2008 onwards)</span><br>In
      general, when examining the funding database, one needs to take the level of
      granularity into consideration.  In other words, a decision needs to be made
      beforehand about whether it is more interesting to know about the total publications
      of the NWO as a whole (Figure 3), or about the publications resulting from each
      suborganization (Figure 4).  This decision depends on the aim of the research.
      \ For instance, the former case may be more useful when comparing the national
      research funders of different countries, while the latter may be more interesting
      when analyzing the funding outcomes of each individual suborganization.</p><figure><img

      are more distributed using the \u2018Detail Count\u2019. We can also note that

      data-image=\"21942\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"></figure><p><br>The discrepancies
      in total funding acknowledgements between the first two columns, CWTS\u2019
      two different counting systems, do beg the question: how should one attribute
      the credit for the funding: to the parent or the child institute? Additionally,
      how does one define the parent/child relationship? For instance, ZonMw (The
      Netherlands Organization for Health and Research and Development), and the NWO
      Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences do not contribute to the total count
      of the NWO because they are considered as independent funders in our database.
      This type of classification implies a different type of role and function for
      ZonMw compared to the other suborganizations of the NWO. This is an ontological
      issue, one which the A-Team <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\">deals
      with on a semi-regular basis</a>. Ultimately, there is no definitive acknowledgment
      count; instead, the answer to the query depends on a case-by-case basis, based
      on what the researcher or funding agency is looking to find out. Our job is
      to make the database as capable as possible to deal with all such possible queries.</p><p>For
      a more detailed examination, we now look at two of the publications attributed
      to suborganizations in the Detail Count, but not featured in either of the other
      counts.</p><p></p><p></p><table style=\"width:100%;\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"25%\"

      to move forward: efforts at standardisation</h3><p>Most likely, the difference
      in numbers above also stems from the databases\u2019 different approaches in
      obtaining their data: one goes through the acknowledgment text while the other
      (also) gets its data directly from the funder itself. While we will continue
      to work hard to follow the funding streams and improve the accuracy of our data,
      funders, researchers and journals can also do their bit to improve the situation.</p><p>One
      recent development in acknowledgment practices has been for funders to stipulate
      in more precise terms how researchers need to acknowledge their funding. The
      NWO, for instance, gives the following template:<br></p><p style=\"width:100%;font-size:10pt;text-align:center;\">This
      publication is part of the project [name project] (with project number [insert
      project number] of the research programme [name research programme] which is
      (partly) financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).</p><p>Such templates
      might serve to shift back control to funders on which of their grants are acknowledged
      on which level. In the above case, if NWO wants funding credit to go to a specific
      institute, it can change the template. Moreover, it also urges researchers to
      include more detailed information like project names and numbers, which can
      ultimately help databases to more accurately track funding streams.</p><p>In
      order for such templates to work, researchers need to do their part by consistently
      following them. If a template does not exist, being accurate and complete goes
      a long way: include the official funder name and anything trackable like project
      and grant numbers.</p><p>Journals too have started to aid the process by providing
      dedicated funding fields in their application forms of their submission systems,
      as for instance the <a href=\"https://plos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PLoS</a>\r\njournals
      do. This way, financial support gets clearly distinguished from acknowledgments
      of gratitude (for instance).</p><p>These templates and alternative acknowledgement
      practices are steps towards answering the eternal question in funding acknowledgement
      research: to count or not to count.</p><p><em>Part 1 of the series on Funding

      maps are essential tools in quantitative research studies. In this blog post

      more information, enhanced transparency and interpretability.</summary><content

      maps have been created for decades to provide overview of research and to make
      it possible for researchers to study different aspects of the research landscape,
      such as collaboration patterns, structure of research fields and citation relations.
      Several tools have been created that make it easy to create maps from bibliographic
      records imported from different data sources. Using these tools, maps can be
      created without any coding. The end result is often a static image showing some
      nodes and their relations. The maps are useful, because they simplify large
      amounts of data and highlight patterns in the data. </p><p>Static maps must
      be reduced to a limited number of nodes and edges to be readable. If we deal
      with large publication sets, this means that data must be either heavily restricted
      or aggregated. A lot of detail is being lost in this process, leading to reduced
      transparency and decreased interpretability. A <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">new version of VOSviewer</a> has made it possible to create
      bibliometric maps and publish them online. Such maps offer more interactivity
      by zooming capabilities and information can be shown when clicking nodes or
      edges. This interactivity makes it possible to visualize more nodes and to provide
      more information. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://petersjogarde.github.io/pm_classification/2021/research_areas/index.html\"

      literature, based on more than 3 million publications in PubMed, I go one step
      further. The visualization provides interactive features to navigate from broad
      disciplines down to narrow topics and retrieve the publications underlying the
      classification. Thereby, the visualization provides both overview of a vast
      amount of research literature as well as details down to individual publications.

      The user can use information about relations to other clusters, underlying topics
      and retrieve publications when interpreting the contents of clusters. Nevertheless,
      many challenges remain. Clustering methodologies can be improved by making the
      resulting classifications easier to interpret, also outside the field of quantitative
      science studies. Overlaps of fields may be integrated into the maps and there
      might be better ways to position the nodes in the maps. I think that visualizations
      of this kind make weaknesses more apparent and provide a good point of departure
      for further development.</p><p>The results of the clustering methodologies are
      made transparent by providing interactive features and by making the maps and
      underlying data openly available. Anyone can navigate the map and get an impression
      of its validity, and anyone can download it and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.
      My hope is that this transparency can contribute to improved clustering methodologies
      and more user-oriented maps of research. I think that bibliometric maps of other
      types should follow this example: (1) make the maps interactive, (2) provide
      as much detail as possible, and (3) make the underlying data openly available.</p>\n\n

      \                                               <p>To tackle today\u2019s societal
      challenges requires research collaboration across organizations and disciplines.
      Making research collaborations work is not always easy, especially when collaborations
      involve diverse organisations and stakeholders who do not necessarily share
      the same logics and objectives. We conducted a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462\"
      target=\"_blank\">study</a> on researchers holding part-time positions in different
      organisations, considering them as key \u2018bridge persons\u2019 connecting
      organisations in the research landscape, linking heterogeneous organisations
      fostering coordination and exchange of knowledge. </p><p>More specifically,
      we analysed the drivers of researchers holding multiple appointments. To this
      end, we rely on the notion of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0034340052000320887\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>proximity</em></a>. We focussed on the effect of geographic
      and institutional proximity on the number of researchers holding part-time positions
      among any two organizations. The methodology we developed could also serve as
      a framework to benchmark national innovation systems of different countries.
      Such comparative exercise could reveal the relative importance of travel distance
      and institutional barriers in each country.</p><h3><strong>The Netherlands as
      a case study</strong></h3><p>In order to explore the role of geographic distance
      and institutional proximity for researchers holding multiple affiliations, we
      focused on a country whose research system we know quite well: The Netherlands.
      Using scientific publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we identified
      all authors who simultaneously indicated two or more institutional affiliations
      in the Netherlands (we excluded for this study authors whose multiple affiliations
      included foreign organisations). The selection process relied on an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03410-y\"
      target=\"_blank\">algorithm developed some years ago by colleagues at CWTS</a>,
      which allows for the identification of all the publications produced by a given
      individual. As we wanted to focus on those researchers with a truly part-time
      position rather than researchers changing jobs, we selected only those researchers
      indicating the same multiple affiliations in 2016 and in 2018. Following this
      rather conservative criterion, we identified 2,828 researchers employed by 626
      Dutch organisations. The resulting inter-organisational network included nearly
      two hundred thousand unique organisation pairs (195,625 pairs, to be precise).
      Obviously, the vast majority of organisations included in our study did not
      have any researcher linking them through her multiple institutional affiliations.
      Only slightly less than 1% of all these pairs of organisations were actually
      connected through one or several researchers with multiple affiliations. Figure
      1 depicts the inter-organisational network, including only organisations with
      four or more co-affiliated researchers.</p><p>We then tested whether the number
      of co-affiliated researchers to a pair of organizations depends on the <em>geographic
      </em>and<em> institutional proximities</em>\r\nbetween organizations using a
      gravity model, quite popular among geographers of innovation. We measured the
      <em>geographic distance</em>\r\nbetween two organizations by the time required
      to travel from the municipality of the one organization to the municipality
      of the other organization. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1_ayegros_nov21.tif.jpg\"
      alt=\"Figure 1 ayegros nov21 tif\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Inter-organisational
      network derived from authors listing multiple affiliations. The sizes of the
      nodes represent the numbers of publications of the organisations (2016 and 2018)
      and thickness of the lines the number of researchers connecting them through
      multiple affiliations.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, we considered <em>institutional
      proximity </em>when two organisations linked by a researcher with multiple affiliations
      belong to the same institutional sector. For this, we classified all the organisations
      in institutional sectors: University, Industry, Government, Public Research
      Organisation (PRO) and Healthcare organizations. Figure 2 shows the same network
      of organisations as Figure 1, but including colours to indicate the institutional
      sectors.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_2_ayegros_nov21.jpg\"
      alt=\"Figure 2 ayegros nov21\"><figcaption>Figure 2. Institutional sectors in
      the Inter-organisational network derived from authors listing multiple affiliations.</figcaption></figure><h3>What
      does our analysis show?</h3><p>First (as we expected), travel time clearly decreases
      the chances of multiple affiliations. That is, the longer the geographic distance
      between two organisations, the less likely a researcher will be affiliated simultaneously
      to these two organisations. In other words, researchers with dual appointments
      tend to be affiliated with two organisations located nearby one another, indicating
      the relevance of commuting time. Regarding institutional proximity, our results
      indicate that researchers holding multiple affiliations do not prefer to work
      for organisations in the same institutional sector. Rather, they tend to cross
      institutional sectors, and in doing so they could indeed be acting as bridging
      persons who connect heterogeneous organisations. Thus, these researchers may
      contribute to creating bridges between these (sometimes very) different types
      of organisations, guided by different logics and objectives. In a further exploration
      of the role of institutional proximity, we found that mainly university researchers
      play the central role in connecting the entire national research system through
      co-affiliations with industry, government, healthcare and PROs, as well as among
      universities themselves.</p><h3>Implications</h3><p>We consider that individuals
      holding part-time positions in several organisations represent a very special
      actor in the research landscape, even more when the organisations they connect
      operate in different sectors. Individuals, rather than formal arrangements,
      may find it easier to cross institutional boundaries between university, industry,
      government, PROs, and healthcare organizations. While connections can also be
      made via alternative arrangements (e.g. public-private partnerships, contract
      research, participation in joint research projects, among others), having researchers
      with dual appointments may represent a very efficient and effective way in navigating
      potential conflicts when trying to connect very different organisations. At
      the same time, such individuals should be supported in their complex roles avoiding
      conflicts of interest at the personal level.</p><p><be>If you would like to

      target=\"_blank\">time-consuming activity</a>. In 2020 I received 73 invitations
      to review a new article submitted to a scientific journal. On average, reviewing
      an article, both the original version and possibly also subsequent revised versions,
      probably takes me about seven hours in total. I am in the fortunate situation
      of being able to invest a significant amount of time in peer review. Of the
      73 invitations that I received in 2020, I accepted 24, resulting in an estimated
      time investment of 24 \xD7 7 = 168 hours in peer review of journal articles.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Is the time invested in peer review well spent? To some extent I
      believe it is. As a reviewer I think I usually manage to help authors improve
      their work. In most cases, I am probably also able to provide useful advice
      to the editors of a journal helping them decide whether to publish an article
      or not.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nevertheless, despite the value my reviews may have
      for authors and editors, I often do not feel satisfied with the way my reviews
      are used. A review is typically read by just a few people: one or more journal
      editors, the authors of the article under review, and perhaps also other reviewers
      of the article. Importantly, readers of an article typically do not have access
      to the reviews of the article, even though the reviews may give them a lot of
      valuable information. Reviews are likely to offer readers an insightful perspective
      on the strengths and weaknesses of an article, and on issues on which authors
      and reviewers may not agree.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By making reviews available only
      to the small group of individuals directly involved in the peer review process
      of an article, readers of the article are denied the opportunity to benefit
      from the information provided by the reviews. Given the significant efforts
      made by many reviewers to provide detailed comments on the articles they review,
      this is a major waste of scientific labor. For me personally this is why I tend
      to feel dissatisfied with the way my reviews are used, making me question whether
      the time I invest in peer review is really well spent.</p><h3><strong>Making
      peer review more useful</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">An important step toward
      making peer review more useful is to <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/letter\"
      target=\"_blank\">publish reviews</a> alongside accepted articles, either with
      or without revealing the identity of the reviewers. This form of transparent
      or open peer review was pioneered by publishers like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g5394\"
      target=\"_blank\">BMJ</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762\"
      target=\"_blank\">BMC</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2008.250\"
      target=\"_blank\">EMBO</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00799\"
      target=\"_blank\">eLife</a>. It is gradually being adopted more widely, for
      instance by some <a href=\"https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/what-is-peer-review/transparent-peer-review.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">Wiley</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00309-9\"
      target=\"_blank\">Springer Nature</a> journals, and also by <a href=\"https://www.issi-society.org/blog/posts/2020/september/quantitative-science-studies-launches-transparent-peer-review-pilot/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Quantitative Science Studies</em></a>, of which I am Editor-in-Chief.
      A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03488-4\" target=\"_blank\">recent
      study</a> shows that the number of journals offering some form of transparent
      or open peer review has increased rapidly over the last few years (see Figure
      1).</p><figure class=\"image-full\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure-1-Wolfram-et-al.png\"
      data-image=\"21291\" style=\"opacity: 1;\"><figcaption style=\"text-align:center;\">Figure
      1. Number of journals offering some form of transparent or open peer review
      (source: Wolfram et al., 2020).</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Ongoing
      developments in scholarly publishing offer additional opportunities to make
      better use of the efforts of reviewers. Nowadays many articles are already available
      online on a preprint server (or in an institutional repository) long before
      they appear in a journal. For these articles, peer review can be made more useful
      by publishing reviews as soon as they are available instead of postponing this
      until the article appears in a journal (which may take months or even years,
      or which may not happen at all). Immediate publication of reviews provides valuable
      information to readers of the preprint version of an article. Publishers could
      facilitate immediate publication of reviews, as is done by <a href=\"https://f1000.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">F1000</a>, but reviewers can also take care of this themselves
      by posting their reviews online.</p><h3><strong>Reconsidering my own approach
      to peer review</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">To make my own peer review activity
      more useful, I have reconsidered my way of working as a reviewer, partly also
      by taking inspiration from others (see for instance the <a href=\"https://fraserlab.com/compact/#peer_review\"
      target=\"_blank\">approach to peer review</a> taken by James Fraser at UC San
      Francisco). From now on, when choosing which review invitations to accept and
      which ones to decline, I will give priority to journals that offer transparent
      peer review. In addition, when I finish a review of an article that is available
      as a preprint, I will immediately publish my review online, so that readers
      of the preprint can benefit from it. I will also prioritize reviewing such articles
      over reviewing articles that are not available as a preprint.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In
      the last two months, I published my first two reviews online. They are available
      <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21428/7ccec04a.f98305d0\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>
      and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21428/7ccec04a.d1905fa3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
      I used the <a href=\"https://www.pubpub.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PubPub platform</a>
      for this, but various other platforms can be used as well. Importantly, PubPub
      facilitates registering a DOI for a review and making the metadata of the review
      available through <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a>.
      This metadata includes a link between the review and the preprint version of
      the article under review. This link enables preprint servers and discovery tools
      to inform their users about the availability of a review for a preprint.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">One of the articles that I reviewed had a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-783543/v1\"
      target=\"_blank\">preprint</a> on Research Square. For this preprint I posted
      a brief comment on the preprint platform to draw attention to my review. The
      other article had a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3874974\" target=\"_blank\">preprint</a>
      on SSRN, which does not provide the possibility to post comments. Unfortunately,
      this means that many readers of the preprint probably will not be aware of my
      review.</p><h3><strong>Toward a broader initiative</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Some
      of the above ideas to make peer review more useful were discussed in a session
      that I co-organized with Cooper Smout (founder of <a href=\"https://freeourknowledge.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Free Our Knowledge</a>) and James Fraser in ASAPbio\u2019s
      recent <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/feedbackasap\" target=\"_blank\">#FeedbackASAP
      workshop</a>. As a result of this session, we are preparing a broader initiative
      to <a href=\"https://asapbio.org/considering-campaigns-to-post-journal-reviews-on-preprints\"

      the way marine social scientists make their research visible.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3><strong>The
      Case of Marine Social Science</strong><br></h3><p>The health of oceans and marine
      environments \u2013 key to both the climate and the global economy - is receiving
      growing societal attention. Science and policy related to ocean and marine health
      are, for example, promoted by the United Nation\u2019s Decade of Ocean Science
      for Sustainable Development (2021-2030). Better understanding the impact of
      human practices on oceans, marine environments and coasts is key to protecting
      and sustainably using them. This provides momentum for the marine social sciences
      \u2013 a collection of interdisciplinary research which explores the multifaceted
      relationships between people and oceans, marine and coastal environments. However,
      <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901119312961\"
      target=\"_blank\">marine social scientists argue that even though the importance
      of their field is increasingly recognised, marine social sciences are not yet
      well integrated into marine and ocean research and policy:</a><br></p><p>As
      the quote suggests, marine social scientists are actively working on creating
      relations with each other, as well as scientists from diverse disciplines and
      practitioners to better integrate the marine social sciences into ocean science
      and policy.</p><p>This blogpost documents our ongoing mixed methods research
      which combines science and technology studies (STS) and quantitative science
      studies (QSS) in the <a href=\"https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FluidKnowledge
      project</a>. It conceptually reflects on how we combine STS and QSS to explore
      the way marine social scientists build relationships with scientists, policy
      makers and practitioners, in their attempt to better integrate marine social
      science into ocean research and policy.</p><h3><strong>Capturing Relations with
      STS and QSS</strong></h3><p>Building on STS, we approach science as a set of
      relational practices that scientists perform on a daily basis. For example,
      they develop research agendas in collaboration with fellow scientists and practitioners,
      in light of funding opportunities and (disciplinary) epistemic norms and values,
      mediated by the data infrastructures and methods they use. Focusing on such
      relations can help explore how the marine social sciences engage and are engaged
      by diverse actors, including fellow researchers (from diverse disciplines) and
      practitioners.</p><p>Quantitative science studies - including scientometrics
      and altmetrics - can help trace the relations of marine social science publications
      and marine social science related digital traces (e.g. project websites, social
      media accounts) to scientific literature and societal discussions, <a href=\"https://digitalsts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/32_digitalSTS_Actor-Network.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">for example, using network analysis</a>. We plan to benefit
      from quantitative science studies methods\u2019 affordance to depict diverse
      relations. For example, we may map online discussions of marine social science
      <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04251\" target=\"_blank\">through social
      media traces and weblinks</a>, marine social science literature\u2019s position
      on the science landscape and study changes in marine social science key topics
      using term maps. </p><p>However, compared to STS\u2019 focus on multimodal relational
      practices that unfold on diverse time scales, <a href=\"http://www.tecnoscienza.net/index.php/tsj/article/view/178/117\"
      target=\"_blank\">quantitative network analysis may \u2018flatten\u2019 relations</a>.
      In other words, they may obscure the multiple temporalities, values, materialities
      and subjectivities that relations entail. These, however, are essential to understanding
      marine social scientists\u2019 relationship building efforts \u2013 the challenges
      they face and the values they hold dear, that inform the development of their
      research agendas. To elicit experiences of such relationship building, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/3/1041/96092/From-indicators-to-indicating-interdisciplinarity\"
      target=\"_blank\">we plan to discuss data visualisations</a> with marine social
      scientists. As we discuss below, we plan participatory engagement by creating
      a first version of data analyses and visualisations that provide partial perspectives
      on marine social sciences and speak to their diverse relationalities. These
      visualisations \u2013 which we might alter in dialogue with experts - also help
      us extend our knowledge about marine social science <a href=\"http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/66140/\"
      target=\"_blank\">which helps explore opportunities afforded by mixed methods
      science studies</a>. </p><h3><strong>Multiple Entry Points: Partial Mappings
      of Marine Social Science</strong></h3><p>Marine social sciences explore diverse
      human practices in relation to the oceans, seas and coasts, drawing on diverse
      disciplines, including anthropology, economics, geography, law, political science
      and sociology. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901119312961\"
      target=\"_blank\">Recently, marine social scientists developed attempts to coordinate
      these diverse epistemic communities to set a global marine social science research
      agenda</a>. Similarly, it is challenging to scientometrically delineate marine
      social science. Relevant papers are published across diverse journals, including
      (but limited to) the Maritime Studies, Marine Policy, Progress in Human Geography,
      Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, and journals associated with
      fisheries and coastal research. Keywords that could help capture \u2018all\u2019
      marine social science papers but differentiate them from the \u2018rest of\u2019
      ocean science or social science are challenging to identify.</p><p>To reflect
      the scatteredness and diversity of marine social science, as well as the partiality
      of scientometric and altmetric mappings, we do not try to map the \u2018entirety\u2019
      of marine social science. We feel that depicting marine social science on one
      map \u2013 whilst strengthening the perception of the field\u2019s unity \u2013
      would obscure the work it takes to coordinate the diverse epistemic communities
      that comprise it, and their diverse and evolving relations to ocean science
      and ocean policy. Rather, <a href=\"http://www.tecnoscienza.net/index.php/tsj/article/view/178/117\"
      target=\"_blank\">we chose diverse entry points to the scientometric</a>,  altmetric
      and webometric traces marine social scientists leave. For example, we may study
      published literature and digital traces associated with specific disciplines
      that comprise marine social sciences, marine social science papers published
      in specialised journals or papers and digital traces associated with a specific
      research agenda. </p><h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3><p>Next, in a mixed
      methods study design which combines methods and insights from QSS and STS, we
      plan to create multiple data visualisations and discuss them with marine social
      scientists. For example, to explore a specific disciplinary subset of marine
      social science, we may map marine social science research which builds on interpretative
      social scientific research tradition, such as anthropology and human geography.
      We may also map changes in the topics and connections of papers published in
      a key marine social science journal: the journal <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40152\"
      target=\"_blank\">Maritime Studies</a>. Finally, we may study the connections
      of papers which study a key ocean policy relevant topic: <a href=\"https://marecentre.nl/2021-conference/\"
      target=\"_blank\">blue growth</a>&nbsp;and its limits. </p><p>For each partial
      delineation, we plan to create a set of data visualisations that depict marine
      social science\u2019s internal connections&nbsp;(using, for example, term maps),
      as well as its relations to ocean research (using, for example, maps of science)
      and online discussions (using social media and webometric traces). We hope that
      discussing the diverse relations partial mappings of marine social sciences
      depict with experts will help elicit narratives about the way they negotiate
      values and research agendas with diverse actors and how research (e)valuation
      impacts their work.</p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>This project is funded by

      for Open Abstracts (I4OA)</a> was launched. We started the initiative together
      with a <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#founders\" target=\"_blank\">group of colleagues</a>
      working in the publishing industry, for scholarly infrastructure organizations,
      at university libraries, and at science studies research centers. I4OA called
      on scholarly publishers to make the abstracts of their published works openly
      available in a suitable infrastructure, preferably by submitting them to <a
      href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a>, and it continues
      to make this call. Openness of abstracts makes scholarly outputs <a href=\"https://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/metadata-elements-publishers-should-prioritize/#3-Article-Abstracts\"
      target=\"_blank\">easier to discover</a>, it enables new types of research analytics,
      and it supports science studies research.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this blog post,
      we celebrate the first anniversary of I4OA by summarizing the progress made
      so far and by discussing how I4OA fits into the broader landscape of many ongoing
      developments toward increased openness of the metadata of scholarly outputs.</p><p><strong>How
      much support for open abstracts do we have?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">When
      I4OA was launched one year ago, the initiative was supported by <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/press.html#pressrelease\"
      target=\"_blank\">40 publishers</a>, including Hindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE,
      who are <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#founders\" target=\"_blank\">founding members</a>
      of the initiative. Among the initial supporters of I4OA there were commercial
      publishers (e.g., F1000, Frontiers, Hindawi, MDPI, PeerJ, and SAGE), non-profit
      publishers (e.g., eLife and PLOS), society publishers (e.g., AAAS and Royal
      Society), and university presses (e.g., Cambridge University Press and MIT Press).
      Some of the initial supporters of I4OA are open access publishers, while others
      publish subscription-based journals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past year, the
      number of publishers supporting I4OA has more than doubled. The initiative is
      currently supported by <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#publishers\" target=\"_blank\">86
      publishers</a>. Publishers that have joined I4OA over the past year include
      ACM, American Society for Microbiology, Emerald, Oxford University Press, and
      Thieme. I4OA has also been joined by a substantial number of national and regional
      publishers, for instance from countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and
      Asia.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to this, I4OA is supported by a <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#stakeholders\"

      dir=\"ltr\">However, Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, and Taylor & Francis,
      the four largest publishers in terms of the number of published works, have
      not yet joined I4OA. These publishers appear to monetize their abstracts by
      selling them to abstracting services, and they seem to fear that joining I4OA
      may cause them to lose these revenue streams. Elsevier might also perceive openness
      of abstracts as a competitive threat to its Scopus business. Elsevier, Wiley,
      and Taylor & Francis have not yet submitted any abstracts to Crossref, while
      Springer Nature has started to submit abstracts, but only for its open access
      content.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How many open abstracts do we have?</strong></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">On September 1, 12.3% of the 89.4 million journal articles indexed
      by Crossref had an open abstract. Focusing on the so-called current content
      in Crossref (i.e., content from the last three years), the share of journal
      articles with an open abstract is substantially higher. Of the 12.1 million
      journal articles in the period 2019-2021, 30.1% had an open abstract.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Figure 1 shows the increase over the past few years in the percentage
      of journal articles in Crossref that have an open abstract. For current content,
      this percentage increased from 14.9% in September 2019 to 30.1% in September
      2021, clearly showing the effect of I4OA. For backfiles (i.e., content that
      is at least three years old), the increase is more modest, from 4.8% in September
      2019 to 9.5% in September 2021. This increase reflects the efforts made by several
      publishers (including Hindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE, three founding members
      of I4OA) to make abstracts openly available not only for their new content but
      also for all their older content.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/20211005-1.png\"
      alt=\"20211005 1\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Increase in the percentage of journal
      articles in Crossref that have an open abstract.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      above statistics are specifically about journal articles. Looking at all content
      types in Crossref, including proceedings articles, book chapters, and books,
      the share of open abstracts is somewhat lower. On September 1 this year, 24.8%
      of the current content and 7.3% of the backfiles had an open abstract.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Figure 2 provides a breakdown by publisher of the percentage of
      journal articles in Crossref in the period 2019-2021 that have an open abstract
      (horizontal axis). The figure also shows the total number of journal articles
      of a publisher in the period 2019-2021 (vertical axis; logarithmic scale).<br></p><figure><img

      articles of a publisher in Crossref in the period 2019-2021 vs. percentage of
      journal articles that have an open abstract.</span><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Publishers
      that support I4OA, colored orange in Figure 2, tend to have a high percentage
      of journal articles with an open abstract. They typically do not reach 100%,
      because some of the content they publish does not have an abstract. There are
      a few publishers that only recently started to open their abstracts, so for
      these publishers the percentage of open abstracts is still relatively low. Publishers
      that have not yet expressed support for I4OA are colored blue in Figure 2. Most
      of them have a low percentage of open abstracts, and many do not have any open
      abstracts at all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The progress made by individual publishers
      in opening their abstracts can be clearly seen by comparing Figure 2 with a
      similar figure published in <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-abstracts-where-are-we/\"
      target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a> last year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What
      else happened over the past year?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A very positive
      development in the past year are the accomplishments of the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a>, a sister initiative
      of I4OA that campaigns for publishers to make the references of their published
      works openly available in Crossref. In the first half of 2021, <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/advancing-responsible-research-assessment\"
      target=\"_blank\">Elsevier</a>, American Chemical Society, and Wolters Kluwer
      all opened their references. With the <a href=\"https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2021/09/23/academias-missing-references/\"
      target=\"_blank\">exception of IEEE</a>, all major publishers now support I4OC.
      This development seems to show that most publishers recognize the importance
      of making the metadata of their published works openly available, suggesting
      that many of them may also want to join I4OA.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A less positive
      development was the announcement made last May that <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/articles/microsoft-academic-to-expand-horizons-with-community-driven-approach/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Academic will be discontinued</a> at the end of
      the year. At the moment, Microsoft Academic is the most important data source
      for open abstracts. As shown in a <a href=\"https://curtin-open-knowledge-initiative.github.io/what_do_we_lose_mag/\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent presentation</a> by two of the I4OA founders, more
      than half of the scholarly outputs indexed both by Microsoft Academic and by
      Crossref have an open abstract in Microsoft Academic. Only 10% of these outputs
      have an open abstract in Crossref. Hence, the discontinuation of Microsoft Academic
      will greatly reduce the availability of open abstracts, unless publishers take
      up their responsibility to submit abstracts to Crossref. OurResearch, which
      is building a <a href=\"https://blog.ourresearch.org/openalex-update-june/\"
      target=\"_blank\">replacement for Microsoft Academic</a>, has already announced
      that it will only be able to make abstracts available if publishers submit them
      to Crossref (or PubMed).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another important development is
      the growing adoption of the <a href=\"https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>. These
      principles aim to ensure that scholarly infrastructures serve the interests
      of the scholarly community, and they reduce the risk of the scholarly community
      losing its key infrastructures (as is happening right now with Microsoft Academic).
      The POSI principles have been adopted by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Crossref</a> and <a href=\"https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2021/08/09/opencitations-compliance-with-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenCitations</a>, two founding members of I4OA. <a href=\"https://blog.ourresearch.org/posi/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OurResearch</a>, mentioned above, has also expressed a commitment
      to these principles. By adopting the POSI principles, these infrastructure organizations
      have made a clear commitment to serve the interests of the scholarly community
      and to ensure the long-term availability of scholarly metadata.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Next
      steps</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In light of the closure of Microsoft Academic
      at the end of the year, it is more important than ever to get broad support
      for I4OA. This is further reinforced by the increasing dependence of research
      analytics on abstracts. While research analytics based on citations continue
      to play an important role in research assessments and research on research (e.g.,
      topic mapping, analyzing emerging trends and research fronts), the need to broaden
      the analytical toolbox is widely recognized. Many providers of research analytics
      are introducing new indicators and tools. In particular, analytics for assessing
      the contribution of research to the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs)
      are attracting a lot of attention (e.g., in the <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2021/overall\"
      target=\"_blank\">Times Higher Education Impact Rankings</a>). These analytics
      typically identify SDG-related research by searching for specific terms (e.g.,
      \u2018climate change\u2019, \u2018hunger\u2019, \u2018poverty\u2019, and so
      on) in the titles and abstracts of scholarly outputs. Openness of abstracts
      is essential to develop a proper understanding of what these analytics do and
      do not tell us, and to make sure these analytics are used in a responsible way.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Publishers carry the primary responsibility for making abstracts
      openly available. We therefore call on publishers that do not yet support I4OA
      to join the initiative and to open their abstracts. The I4OA team is available
      to answer questions about the initiative and to provide help to publishers that
      want to join. Do not hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:openabstracts@gmail.com\"
      target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We also encourage other
      stakeholders in the research system to actively support openness of abstracts.
      As shown in Figure 3, in a <a href=\"https://metadata2020.org/do-more/negotiate-in-contracts/\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent Metadata 20/20 webinar</a>, participants mentioned
      abstracts as the most important metadata element for which openness should be
      an essential requirement in negotiations with publishers. This highlights the
      crucial contribution that research institutions and research funders can make
      by <a href=\"https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2020/09/24/tib-supports-initiative-for-open-abstracts-i4oa/\"

      just published its open science policy. The development of this policy was coordinated
      by Thed van Leeuwen and Ludo Waltman. In this blog post, they reflect on the
      journey CWTS is making toward more open ways of working.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p dir=\"ltr\">Today CWTS published
      its <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\" target=\"_blank\">open
      science policy</a> on its website. This policy, which formally came into effect
      on September 1 this year, is the outcome of a co-creation process in which many
      CWTS colleagues participated in a period of one and a half years. In this blog
      post, we discuss the <em>why</em>, the <em>how</em>, and the <em>what </em>of
      the CWTS open science policy.</p><h3><strong>Why did we develop an open science
      policy?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past decade, CWTS has been involved
      in a large number of activities in the area of open science, ranging from monitoring
      of open access publishing and studying of open data practices to the development
      of open infrastructures and contributions to policy making around open science.
      However, while open science had become an increasingly important object of study
      in our work, many of our own research practices were still fairly traditional
      and not necessarily in line with an open science way of working. This led to
      a recognition that we needed to reflect more actively on our own research practices:
      Did we actually practice what we were preaching? And how could we do better?
      In late 2018, this process resulted in the decision to develop a CWTS open science
      policy.<br></p><h3><strong>How did we develop our open science policy?</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">We started by inviting all CWTS colleagues to participate in meetings
      in which the basics of open science were discussed and in which colleagues were
      asked to choose the aspects of open science they considered to be most important
      for CWTS. Four topics were chosen: open access publishing, open research data,
      open source software, and the relationship between open science and the work
      of <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">CWTS BV</a>. A number
      of colleagues then volunteered to prepare a policy around these four aspects
      of open science. All CWTS colleagues were given the opportunity to provide feedback
      on the proposed policy.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The open science policy was formally
      approved by the CWTS board in June 2020. We then went through a one-year transition
      period (September 2020-August 2021) in which everyone at CWTS had the opportunity
      to familiarize themselves with the policy and to start implementing the policy
      in their work. Several meetings were organized during this transition period
      to support colleagues in the implementation of the policy. In September 2021,
      the policy formally entered into force. All research at CWTS is now expected
      to be carried out in accordance with our open science policy.<br></p><h3><strong>What
      does our open science policy say?</strong><br></h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><br>Guiding
      principles<br></em>As a starting point for the CWTS open science policy, we
      formulated five principles that provide general guidance for the CWTS approach
      to open science:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1.\tAs open as possible, as closed as necessary</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">2.\tOpenness is not always easy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3.\tOpenness
      takes time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4.\tOpenness is a joint responsibility.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">5.\tOpenness should not become a straitjacket.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The
      first principle recognizes that openness is not always possible or desirable
      and that there may be good reasons to keep something closed. We will get back
      to this below in the discussion of open data. The second principle acknowledges
      that openness may come at a cost, for instance in terms of additional efforts
      that need to be made. The third principle emphasizes that becoming more open
      requires a culture change that takes time and will not happen overnight. The
      fourth principle makes clear that openness needs to be done together. No one
      can be expected to carry this responsibility on their own. Supervisors for instance
      have a responsibility to support their PhD candidates in adopting open science
      practices. Finally, the fifth principle recognizes that openness may sometimes
      need to be balanced against other important values, which in some cases may
      justify making exceptions to the open science policy.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Open
      access<br></em>Our open science policy requires all journal articles published
      by CWTS researchers to be made openly accessible, either in a journal (gold
      or hybrid open access) or in a repository (green open access). Also, when an
      article is submitted to a journal, posting the article on a preprint server
      (e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">arXiv</a> or <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv\"
      target=\"_blank\">SocArXiv</a>) is strongly encouraged. Our open science policy
      encourages publishing in journals that are owned by the scholarly community
      and that adopt responsible publishing practices, for instance journals that
      support openness of metadata by participating in initiatives such as <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">I4OC</a> and <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">I4OA</a>.
      To support publishing in gold open access journals, CWTS pays article processing
      charges (APCs) of at most EUR 1200 from its basic funding. For APCs paid from
      grant funding there is no maximum. The open science policy also encourages open
      access publishing of conference papers, book chapters, and books, but the policy
      currently does not mandate this.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To help CWTS colleagues
      make their research openly accessible, a toolbox has been created that provides
      information on the journals most frequently used by CWTS researchers. The toolbox
      for instance offers information on licenses under which research can be made
      openly accessible, APCs for open access publishing, and <a href=\"https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/publisher-deals\"
      target=\"_blank\">transformative agreements</a> between the Dutch universities
      and publishers that may cover the cost of open access publishing.<br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><em>Open data<br></em>Regarding openness of research data, our open
      science policy states that data should be as open as possible and as closed
      as necessary. By default, data should be made openly available, but there can
      be several reasons to keep data closed. For instance, in ethnographic research,
      data may be co-owned by research participants that do not want the data to be
      opened. In scientometric research, data may be owned by companies that do not
      allow the data to be opened.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">CWTS also follows the <a
      href=\"https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/regulations/general/leiden-university-data-management-regulation\"
      target=\"_blank\">data management regulations of Leiden University</a>. These
      regulations specify how data should be managed before, during, and after a research
      project. Unlike our open science policy, the data management regulations do
      not indicate whether data should be open or closed. Regardless of whether data
      is open or closed, our open science policy encourages compliance of the data
      with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18\" target=\"_blank\">FAIR
      (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles</a>.<br></p><p
      dir=\"ltr\"><em>Open source<br></em>Our open science policy distinguishes between
      two types of software, referred to as type 1 and type 2 software. Type 1 software
      represents a significant scientific advancement, while type 2 software is instrumental
      to scientific research but does not itself represent a significant scientific
      advancement. For Type 1 software, our open science policy requires the source
      code to be made open. The <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses\" target=\"_blank\">open
      source license</a> (e.g., MIT, GPL, LGPL) can be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
      Examples of type 1 software developed at CWTS are the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2u2a4\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden algorithm</a> for network clustering and the recently
      released <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online tool</a> for interactive network visualization.
      Another example is the <a href=\"https://igraph.org/\" target=\"_blank\">igraph
      package</a> for network analysis, for which <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/news?article=n-s2u234\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS is one of the contributors</a>. An example of type 2
      software is the software developed by CWTS for parsing data delivered to our
      center by data providers such as Clarivate (Web of Science),  Digital Science
      (Dimensions), and Elsevier (Scopus). According to our open science policy, the
      source code of type 2 software may or may not be made open, depending on what
      seems best for the sustainability of the software.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>CWTS
      BV<br></em>Open science also aims to make research results more accessible for
      societal stakeholders and to involve these stakeholders in research projects.
      For CWTS this aspect of open science is for instance reflected in the contributions
      we make to Horizon projects funded by the European Union and to projects of
      the <a href=\"https://researchonresearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Research on
      Research Institute (RoRI)</a>. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS BV</a>, a business unit affiliated with our center, also
      plays an important role.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">CWTS BV provides services to
      clients based partly on insights resulting from the research of CWTS. The other
      way around, projects carried out by CWTS BV also offer important input for the
      research agenda of CWTS. As an independent legal entity, CWTS BV is not subject
      to the CWTS open science policy. While openness and transparency are important
      values in the work of CWTS BV, the confidentiality requested by many clients
      of CWTS BV often limits the level of openness that can be achieved. For instance,
      to guarantee confidentiality, many reports of CWTS BV cannot be made openly
      accessible.<br></p><h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the
      coming years, we expect further updates to be made to the CWTS open science
      policy, partly based on practical experiences in the implementation of the policy
      and partly based on developments in the broader open science landscape and in
      the ambitions we have at CWTS to make our research more open. In fact, some
      CWTS colleagues are already adopting open science practices that go beyond the
      current requirements of the CWTS open science policy. For instance, some colleagues
      are systematically posting all their research on preprint servers and some have
      started to experiment with more open forms of peer review (e.g., online posting
      of review reports).<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In parallel with these developments,
      CWTS is also actively exploring the use of open infrastructures for research
      information. In line with our efforts to promote <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/publications-should-be-fair\"
      target=\"_blank\">openness of bibliographic metadata</a> and of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893803\"
      target=\"_blank\">research information more generally</a>, we are for instance
      working on the institute-wide adoption of <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID
      profiles</a> to keep track of our activities and outputs. Likewise, in our scientometric
      work, we are making significant efforts to reduce our dependence on proprietary
      data sources and to optimally benefit from the opportunities offered by open
      data sources.<br></p><p>Several CWTS colleagues have also expressed a desire
      for more formal ways of recognizing the efforts everyone at CWTS is making to
      adopt open science practices. This issue is currently being addressed as part
      of an ongoing project aimed at revising the approach we take at CWTS to <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts\"
      target=\"_blank\">recognition and rewards</a>.<br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">We realize
      that our journey toward more open ways of working has just begun. We look forward
      to the next steps!</p><p><br><br></p><p><em>We thank all (current and former)

      \                                               <h3><strong>Toward integration
      of data, computing, and tools</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Bibliometrics is often
      equated with straightforward numerical indicators like publication and citation
      counts, journal impact factors, and h-indices. Without any doubt these are indeed
      the most often used items in the bibliometric toolbox.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However,
      the bibliometric toolbox is expanding in a number of important directions. Bibliometric
      data sources are becoming more open and more comprehensive in terms of the scholarly
      outputs they cover. Cloud computing offers flexible ways to perform complex
      large-scale bibliometric analyses. And <a href=\"http://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2021/06/playing-devils-adovcate-why-newly.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">bibliometric tools increasingly run on the web</a>, often
      with a direct connection to the underlying data sources.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These
      developments are still in a relatively early stage, but they clearly show what
      is ahead of us. We are moving toward an increasingly integrated ecosystem of
      bibliometric data sources, computing platforms, and end-user tools, all operating
      in a fully online environment.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">launch last week of VOSviewer Online</a>, a web-based version
      of our VOSviewer tool for visualizing bibliometric networks, contributes to
      the above developments. Today we released version 1.6.17 of the <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">regular stand-alone VOSviewer tool</a>, which is another step
      in the same direction. The new version of VOSviewer makes use of the opportunities
      offered by VOSviewer Online to provide an easy way to share visualizations online.
      It also offers support for the <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lens</a>,
      a freely accessible bibliometric data source that is becoming increasingly popular.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Sharing
      VOSviewer visualizations online</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer has a
      new share feature that allows interactive VOSviewer visualizations to be made
      available online. This feature can be used to upload the network visualized
      in VOSviewer to a cloud storage service. At the moment three services are supported:
      Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox. The network will be uploaded
      in a VOSviewer JSON file, a new file type supported by VOSviewer. Using the
      JSON file available in the cloud, the network will then be opened and visualized
      in <a href=\"https://app.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online</a>,
      the new web-based version of VOSviewer that we released last week.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A
      next step is to use the share&nbsp;feature in VOSviewer Online to obtain a link
      to the interactive network visualization in VOSviewer Online. This link can
      be used to share the visualization with others. In addition, as discussed in
      <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">last week\u2019s blog post</a>, it is also possible to embed
      the visualization in a web page.<br></p><h3><strong>Support for the Lens</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer provides support for constructing bibliometric networks
      based on data from a broad range of open data sources, including Crossref, Europe
      PMC, Microsoft Academic, OpenCitations, and PubMed. Some of the other data sources
      supported by VOSviewer, such as Dimensions, offer free access to (parts of)
      their data, but they do impose restrictions on how the data can be used.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer version 1.6.17 offers support for constructing bibliometric
      networks based on data exported from the <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lens</a>.
      Data from the Lens is freely accessible for personal use with very few restrictions.
      Institutions need a subscription to use the institutional tools provided by
      the Lens or to use data from the Lens commercially. However, the Lens has an
      <a href=\"https://about.lens.org/policies/#termsuse\" target=\"_blank\">equitable
      access policy</a> promising that \u201Cno one will ever be disadvantaged by
      lack of access to Lens.org institutional tools\u201D.&nbsp;Importantly, the
      export feature in the web interface of the Lens is very generous. It enables
      users to export data for up to 50,000 records, which compares favorably with
      other data sources.<br></p><h3><strong>Example</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Below
      we show a visualization of a co-authorship network of researchers at Leiden
      University and their external collaborators. This visualization illustrates
      the new features introduced in VOSviewer version 1.6.17. We used the new version
      of VOSviewer to construct the co-authorship network based on data from the Lens
      and to make the network available in the cloud by uploading it to Google Drive.
      VOSviewer Online is used to present an interactive visualization of the network.&nbsp;While
      this example is based on data from the Lens, any data source supported by VOSviewer
      can be used to create interactive online visualizations.<br></p><figure><iframe

      is next?</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">There is an increasing demand for new forms
      of bibliometrics that provide richer and more contextualized information than
      traditional one-dimensional bibliometric indicators. New forms of bibliometrics
      for instance play an important role in the development of more responsible approaches
      to research assessment. We see the trend toward an integrated ecosystem of bibliometric
      data sources, computing platforms, and end-user tools as a key enabling factor
      for these new forms of bibliometrics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">Last week\u2019s release of VOSviewer Online</a> and today\u2019s
      update of the regular VOSviewer tool represent two small steps within the broader
      trend toward integration of data, computing, and tools.&nbsp;One of the next
      steps that we are working on is the integration of VOSviewer visualizations
      in the <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions platform</a>,
      as announced at the recent ISSI 2021 conference.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the longer
      term, we envision the emergence of online platforms in which bibliometric data
      sources, facilities for cloud storage and cloud computing, algorithms for large-scale
      data analysis, and a broad range of tools for end users will all be connected
      to each other. We see VOSviewer Online as a building block for such platforms.
      It seems likely that stand-alone tools such as the regular version of VOSviewer
      will become obsolete in the longer term.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The integration of
      bibliometric data sources, computing platforms, and end-user tools is in an
      early stage of development. There is still a lot of work to do. We look forward
      to joining forces with colleagues and partners in the bibliometric community
      to take next steps on this exciting journey!<br></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Nees

      prepares for a new phase in its organization. In our new strategy, we aim to
      put our values first. A value-based strategy is the cornerstone of a well-functioning,
      positive research culture. Through open dialogue sessions we started to further
      shape this culture.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>At
      CWTS, we have substantial expertise in research evaluation, including academic
      careers, institutional evaluation, journal evaluation, university rankings,
      responsibility and engagement, and open science. We regularly reach out to share
      our knowledge and foster good practice. But do we also \u2018practice what we
      preach\u2019? Are we doing enough to foster an appreciative working culture,
      to harbour a safe space, and to promote open dialogues? How about vitality in
      career perspectives, promoting wellbeing, and rewarding activities that improve
      the research environment and serve a wider societal context? Which building
      blocks for a responsible recognition and reward system are missing?</p><p>Our
      internal working group on Recognition and Reward<a href=\"#_ftn1\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>\r\nrecently
      asked organizational expert <a href=\"https://freerk.net/who/\">Freerk Wortelboer</a>
      to host small-scale dialogue sessions with the entire CWTS staff. In small groups,
      colleagues shared their views and experiences with recognition and reward mechanisms
      within academia and at CWTS. Last month, the institute gathered online to discuss
      the harvest of these sessions and to brainstorm about ways forward.</p><p>In
      preparing my introduction for that session, I went on a short trip down memory
      lane. I started to reminisce about when I came to CWTS ten years ago \u2013
      straight out of a postdoc position in Amsterdam. I quite vividly remember what
      the institute looked like in terms of the type of research, the type of contract
      work, and the demographics of its staff. This composition had served the institute
      and company well, but there was also room for - and a need for - change. With
      Paul Wouters as director, CWTS developed a broader ambition in diversifying
      its approach and staff.</p><p>At the time, I was part of a broader influx of
      new staff tasked with developing new research lines with existing staff. The
      institute grew and diversified by hosting more people with different cultural,
      methodological, and disciplinary backgrounds. Collaborations were extended to
      other areas of research and innovation. More people started to share the responsibility
      of leading the institute and mentoring early-career colleagues. Several thriving
      teams now work on sophisticated <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\">data
      curation</a>, the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/\">LeidenMadtrics blog</a>,
      and the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">Leiden ranking</a>. Colleagues
      in the company part of CWTS developed a wider range of services \u2013 including
      qualitative approaches - for our <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\">consultancy</a>
      fueled by the new research lines. We now cover a diverse range of topics through
      a host of different projects and activities and do so with a large group of
      local, national, and international colleagues. <br></p><p>Although the efforts
      listed above show the intention to move towards a well-functioning research
      culture, some challenges are still here - as reflected by the outcomes of the
      dialogue sessions.</p><p>Below you see a drawing that Freerk Wortelboer drew
      up and that summarizes the \u2018prouds\u2019 (in green) and \u2018sorries\u2019
      (in blue) on recognition and reward that were shared in the dialogue sessions.<br></p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/SdR-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Sd R
      blog\"></figure><p><br></p><p>To be honest, when we started the internal working
      group, I and the other group members had developed a rather analytical approach
      to internally assessing our own recognition and reward mechanisms. After our
      first institute-wide team meeting on this project, colleagues reminded us that
      the topic is also emotionally charged. We were asked to acknowledge this in
      our approach, and rightly so! After some consideration, our group opted for
      a form that reflects what we hope to do more of internally: to provide a psychologically
      safe space to speak up and share views directly with colleagues (rather than,
      e.g., only sharing confidentially in a one-to-one setting).</p><p>When I look
      at the drawing I feel all kinds of things, including satisfaction, recognition,
      and sorrow. But most of all I am grateful that this feedback is now on the table
      - from the accolades and praise to the struggles and the pain. Not only is this
      very important input for the further development of our staff and our organisation,
      but I also think we can take some pride in being able to do this together. I
      believe the willingness to engage also supports our initial idea for the new
      Knowledge Agenda that CWTS will develop in the run-up to 2023. As directors
      of CWTS, <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/ed-noyons\">Ed Noyons</a>, <a
      href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/ludo-waltman\">Ludo Waltman</a> and I hope
      that this strategy will not solely be driven by <em>content</em> or by <em>performance</em>.
      We also want this to be a strategy driven by <em>values</em>. In a values-driven
      Knowledge Agenda, CWTS does not only commit to certain topics and themes, but
      also to culture-related policies and practices \u2013 as we started to do with
      e.g., our Open Science policy. In the spirit of these and other initiatives,
      these research culture-related policies and practices should be community sourced.
      </p><p>To me, this is what we have started to do at scale in the dialogue sessions.
      And this is what we should continue to pursue tomorrow, this week, this year,
      and beyond. Because this dialogue process is not, and should not be, a one-off,
      but something we should continuously spend time on. The budding experience with
      the dialogue sessions suggests that there is a basis to further strengthen an
      appreciative research culture: by meeting and discussing ideas, but increasingly
      also by fostering a safe space to share struggles, make mistakes, talk about
      things that need to change, and be transparent about things that cannot be changed
      too. This means that we should consider</p><ul><li>creating a shared vision
      on the key elements of a value-based strategy (including open science, appreciative
      culture); recognizing all capabilities and contributions</li><li>developing
      a community-sourced strategy that we feel proud of; acknowledging and rewarding
      diversity and equality</li><li>exchanging ideas, listening, and understanding
      what the obstacles for change are; working together and building a community
      in which everyone is heard</li><li>monitoring and regularly evaluating how we
      are doing; scrutinizing the strategy as well as how people are doing</li></ul><p>An
      important target is that in time, most - if not all - of our staff members feel
      supported in their development, both within the Centre and beyond. Not only
      as employees, but as human beings.</p><p><br></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>I

      the new VOSviewer Online software was released by CWTS colleagues Nees Jan van
      Eck and Ludo Waltman. In this post, they discuss the possibilities offered by
      the software.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3><strong>The
      value of bibliometric visualizations</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Bibliometric
      visualizations are often presented as powerful tools for identifying the key
      patterns in large bibliometric data sets. However, not everyone is convinced
      of their value. Some skeptics suggest that these visualizations are <a href=\"http://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2021/06/playing-devils-adovcate-why-newly.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u201Cjust nice to look at but not useful or helpful\u201D</a>.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Based on almost 15 years of experience in working with bibliometric
      visualizations, we have seen many examples of the successful use of these visualizations,
      but we have seen equally many examples of poor ways of using bibliometric visualizations,
      often leading to questionable conclusions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In our experience,
      a carefully designed bibliometric visualization may offer a wealth of valuable
      information. However, to access this information, being able to interactively
      explore the visualization is quite essential. A static visualization without
      any possibility for interaction has much less value, and may be more likely
      to be misinterpreted.<br></p><h3><strong>From static to interactive visualizations</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer
      software</a> enables visualizations of bibliometric networks to be explored
      interactively. Nevertheless, VOSviewer visualizations often end up as static
      images in blog posts, research articles, policy reports, and PowerPoint presentations.
      In this way the visualizations lose a lot of their value, and in the end they
      may indeed be \u201Cjust nice to look at but not useful or helpful\u201D.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">To address this problem, we have developed VOSviewer Online, a web-based
      version of VOSviewer released today. Using VOSviewer Online, visualizations
      of bibliometric networks can be explored interactively in a web browser. This
      makes it much easier to share interactive visualizations, and it reduces the
      need to show static images.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer Online can also be used
      to embed interactive visualizations in a web page. As an example, below we use
      VOSviewer Online to present an interactive visualization of a co-authorship
      network of authors of articles published in <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em>
      and <em>Scientometrics</em> in 2020 and 2021. The network was constructed based
      on <a href=\"https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_mode=content&or_facet_year=2021&or_facet_year=2020&or_facet_source_title=jour.1089056&or_facet_source_title=jour.1377615\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions data</a>.<br></p><figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\"
      src=\"https://app.vosviewer.com/?json=https://app.vosviewer.com/data/QSS_SM_2020-2021_co-authorship_network.json&scale=1.2&item_size_variation=0.6&simple_ui=true\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"75%\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; max-width: 1000px;
      min-height: 500px\"></iframe></figure><h3><strong>VOSviewer and VOSviewer Online</strong></h3><p
      dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer Online can be opened at <a href=\"https://app.vosviewer.com\"
      target=\"_blank\">https://app.vosviewer.com</a>. The tool aims to replicate
      as much as possible the user experience of the regular stand-alone VOSviewer
      software. Visualizations are presented in the same way in the two versions of
      VOSviewer. The user interface is also similar, although we have made some simplifications
      in VOSviewer Online, hopefully making the software even more intuitive to use.</p><p
      dir=\"ltr\">Importantly, unlike the stand-alone VOSviewer software, VOSviewer
      Online currently does not provide any built-in functionality for constructing
      bibliometric networks based on data from bibliographic data sources such as
      Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, Crossref, and others. The stand-alone software
      still needs to be used for this. VOSviewer Online can instead be used to make
      interactive visualizations of bibliometric networks available online and to
      easily share these visualizations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In part 2 of this blog
      post, to be published soon, we will discuss in more detail how the two versions
      of VOSviewer can be used together.<br></p><h3><strong>Embedding interactive
      visualizations in online platforms</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">An exciting feature
      of VOSviewer Online is the possibility to embed interactive visualizations in
      online platforms. The above visualization of a co-authorship network offers
      an example of this feature. The embedding functionality of VOSviewer Online
      has already been tested in other blog posts, like <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset\"
      target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, and it has been used in news articles in <em>Nature
      Index</em>, for instance <a href=\"https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/this-scientific-power-couple-has-one-of-the-largest-publishing-networks-in-biology\"
      target=\"_blank\">this one</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, in the <a href=\"https://deffopera.dk/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OPERA project</a> in Denmark, interactive VOSviewer visualizations
      have been embedded in the <a href=\"https://duraspace.org/vivo/\" target=\"_blank\">VIVO
      system</a>. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neesjanvaneck/status/1414620641039376390\"
      target=\"_blank\">announced last Monday</a> at the ISSI 2021 conference, we
      are also working together with Digital Science to embed VOSviewer visualizations
      in their <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions
      platform</a>. Likewise, VOSviewer visualizations are also going to be embedded
      in the <a href=\"https://www.zeta-alpha.com/product\" target=\"_blank\">AI Research
      Navigator platform</a> created by Zeta Alpha.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">VOSviewer Online
      can be freely integrated in other platforms as well. Although you don\u2019t
      need our help for this, we are happy to discuss the possibilities.</p><figure><img

      contribution of science to technological innovation is subject of ongoing debate.
      In a recent study, our authors investigated how the value of patents depends
      on the scientific articles referenced and what role aspects such as basicness,
      novelty, and interdisciplinarity play in this.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3>The relationship between
      science and technology</h3><p>There is a recurrent debate about how useful science
      is for technological innovation. However, science is heterogenous, and some
      types of scientific outputs may contribute disproportionately to technology.
      We lack empirical evidence to assess whether more applied and interdisciplinary
      research is more directly useful for technology, characteristics which are also
      believed to be key features of research that is useful for society. We also
      do not know whether science\u2019s autonomous pursuit of novelty and peer recognition
      might be at odds with the policy goal of making science more useful for the
      economy and society. Therefore, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08931\"
      target=\"_blank\">we studied</a> how basicness, interdisciplinarity, novelty,
      and scientific citations are associated with patent value.</p><h3>How to trace
      science-technology-linkages?</h3><p>To answer our research question, we first
      need to trace science-technology-linkages. References in patents to science
      provide a paper trail of knowledge flow, and scholars have long exploited these
      references for science and technology studies. However, the state-of-the-art
      practice uses almost exclusively patent front-page references but ignores patent
      in-text references. Patent front-page references are listed on the front page
      of the patent document, reporting prior documents that are relevant for assessing
      the patentability of the invention. Patent in-text references are embedded in
      the full text of the patent, very similar to references in academic papers (see
      Figure 1). Recent studies have suggested that patent in-text reference is a
      better indication of knowledge flow than front-page references.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/jian_wang_figure1.png\" alt=\"Jian
      wang figure1\"><figcaption>Figure 1.  Patent front-page (left) and in-text references
      (right).</figcaption></figure><p>However, extracting patent in-text references
      is a formidable task, as they are embedded in the running text without structural
      cues. We approach this problem as a sequence labeling task. We train <a href=\"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2847/paper-08.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">BERT-based models</a> to automatically classify each word
      as (B) beginning of a reference, (I) inside a reference, or (O) outside a reference.
      These labels then enable us to extract reference strings from the patent text.
      Subsequently, we match the extracted references to individual Web of Science
      (WoS) journal articles using regular expressions and pattern matching. We apply
      this method to 33,337 USPTO biotech utility patents granted between 2006 and
      2010 and extracted their 860,879 in-text and 637,570 front-page references to
      WoS articles.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Jian_wang_Figure2.jpg\"
      alt=\"Jian wang Figure2\"><figcaption>Figure 2. Overlap between in-text and
      front-page references.</figcaption></figure><p>One first observation is the
      remarkably low overlap between patent front-page and in-text references. In
      total, 173,281 references appear both in the text and on the front page of the
      same patent, which accounts for only 20% of all in-text references and 27% of
      all front-page references (Figure 2). This low overlap suggests that in-text
      and front-page references embody different types of information. Accordingly,
      using different types of references to study science-technology-linkages may
      lead to very different conclusions.</p><h3>How does patents\u2019 value depend
      on the characteristics of their referenced scientific articles?</h3><p>We answer
      this question using the dataset of 33,337 USPTO biotech utility patents and
      their 860,879 in-text references to WoS articles. We measure patent value by
      the number of times that a patent is cited by future patents. Combining Negative
      Binomial regressions and non-parametric visualizations, we first observe that
      patents citing more scientific articles also receive more patent citations than
      patents citing fewer or no scientific articles in the same issuing year and
      technology class (Figure 3A). Using a basicness measure based on PubMed <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">MeSH terms</a> (basicness = 3 if a paper has only cell- or
      animal-related MeSH terms, 2 if both cell-/animal-related and human-related
      MeSH terms, and 1 if only human-related MeSH terms), we also find an inverted
      U-shaped effect of basicness on patent citations, when comparing patents with
      the same number of science references and in the same issuing year and technology
      class (Figure 3B). In addition, we identify novel publications as the ones that
      make unprecedented journal combinations in its references. We found that novelty
      displays a discontinuous and nonlinear effect, suggesting a structural change
      between patents building on novel science and those which do not (Figure 3C).
      We do not find clear effects of interdisciplinarity or scientific citations.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/jian_wang_figure3_2.jpg\"
      alt=\"Jian wang figure3 2\"><figcaption>Figure 3. What kinds of science lead
      to more valuable patents? This figure plots the estimated value of patent citations
      for an average patent at different levels of science measures. For Plot A, we
      first sort patents by their number of science references and then classify them
      into 10 ordered and evenly sized levels. Then we run Negative Binomial regression
      using patent citations as the dependent variable, 10 levels of No. science references
      as the independent variables, and patent issuing year and technology class as
      control variables. Then we plot the estimated patent citations for an average
      patent (i.e., issuing year is 2010, IPC is C12N) for each level. For Plot B
      we sort patents by their average basicness instead, and repeat the process,
      additionally controlling for the ln number of science references, which is also
      set to the mean value for specifying the average patent. Plot C follows the
      same procedure as Plot B but focuses on average novelty.</figcaption></figure><h3>What
      are the implications?</h3><p>Regarding science policy, our result partly supports
      <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25990/the-endless-frontier-the-next-75-years-in-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent advocating for application-oriented research</a>. On
      the other hand, it warns that completely dismissing basic research is detrimental
      as the association between basicness and patent value is not a simple negative
      relation. Our results do not provide evidence that interdisciplinary research
      is the key for making science more useful for technological innovation. With
      respect to novelty, our results do not provide a clear message as to whether
      science policy should support novel or non-novel research, as the association
      between novelty and patent value is rather complex. Our results do suggest that
      novelty plays a special role for technological innovation and warns about potential
      disruptions and uncertainties that sourcing novel science can bring about. In
      terms of scientific citations, we do not observe a positive, but neither a negative
      association between them and patent citations. This means that although the
      quality standard or taste might be different between science and technology,
      they are not at war with each other.</p><p>For studies using patent references,
      the low overlap between patent front-page and in-text references, and more importantly
      the fact that they produce different analytical results, warns about a potential
      threat to validity due to data source. This means that we need to better understand
      how references are being generated in patents before we can determine which
      type of references to use in different research contexts. </p><p><em>Our full

      Leonie van Drooge has received the Moderna vaccine. She is not an army enthusiast,
      yet she is grateful to the US Dept. of Defense. Its agency DARPA funded Moderna
      in 2013 to further develop the then-novel mRNA technology. This blog looks into
      how DARPA does or doesn&#039;t solve challenges.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>DARPA is one of many <a href=\"https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-entrepreneurial-state\"
      target=\"_blank\">examples</a> of how the entrepreneurial state makes high-risk
      investments and creates markets. DARPA is often referred to when it comes to
      funding for missions. It is unique and differs in many ways from traditional
      research agencies. This blog post illuminates some of its particularities; some
      inspiring, others just interesting, and again others not so pretty. </p><p>The

      Perspectives on the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</em> as well
      as the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> of DARPA
      are used for this blog. Before I joined CWTS I worked at <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/en\"
      target=\"_blank\">Rathenau Instituut</a>. One of the final projects I worked
      on was dedicated to mission-oriented innovation policies and I did a case study
      on DARPA. I expect the final report to be published soon.</p><h3><strong>With
      a \u201CD\u201D for Defense</strong></h3><p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects
      Agency (DARPA) makes, according to its website, pivotal investments in breakthrough
      technologies for national security. </p><p>The mission to ensure national security
      as well as the relationship with the US army are crucial characteristics. This
      relationship goes back to the origin of DARPA, the Sputnik shock. In 1957 the
      Soviet Union is the first to successfully launch a rocket and satellite, named
      Sputnik, into space. This comes to many as a surprise, not least in the US.
      In 1958 the US establishes what we now know as DARPA. Its mission is national
      security, by ensuring the US is the initiator of strategic technological surprises;
      not the victim.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Sputnik_asm.jpg\"
      data-image=\"19970\"></figure><p></p><p align=\"center\"><span class=\"caption\"
      align=\"center\">Replica of the Sputnik 1 satellite</span></p><p></p><p>The
      US army is the client of DARPA. Its programs are based on challenges the army
      faces and developments the army foresees. DARPA program managers and (office)
      directors meet with, reach out to and collaborate with army representatives
      all the time. DARPA will not develop quick fixes nor incremental adaptations;
      it aims beyond the horizon. Think precision weapons, stealth technology, automated
      voice recognition, global positioning system (GPS), the Internet. </p><p>And
      mRNA vaccination. </p><p>Since a decade or so the human body has been identified
      as one of the most vulnerable aspects of the US army. The army encounters bioterrorism,
      sees increasingly serious (brain) injury, operates with smaller units without
      medics, operates under extreme conditions. And troops encounter infectious diseases.
      </p><h3><strong>The client of DARPA</strong></h3><p>The army is the intended
      user or buyer of the final product or technology. The importance of this close
      relationship between agency and user becomes apparent in the case of the Advanced
      Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). ARPA-E is very much based on DARPA,
      but there are differences. ARPA-E advances high-potential, high-impact energy
      technologies. It aims for no less than economic prosperity, national security
      and environmental wellbeing. However, the Department of Energy is not the main
      client for the technologies ARPA-E develops. It is certain industries, such
      as aviation in case of innovative electric motors, or homeowners in case of
      transformative generators. And in many cases energy companies play a key role,
      either as manufacturer or user.</p><h3><strong>Industry</strong></h3><p>This
      difference between DARPA and ARPA-E sheds light on another key aspect: the industrial
      landscape, and the willingness and ability of companies to further develop novel
      technologies. This is not always the case, certainly not in the long-established
      and traditional energy sector. Existing companies tend to protect their interests.
      Plus they are not keen to embrace novel technologies. </p><p>This is initially
      the case with mRNA technology as well. In 2012 big and traditional pharmaceutical
      companies, such as Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur, receive
      funding from DARPA to develop mRNA technology. The results are good, yet the
      companies lose interest. The novelty of the mRNA technology implies uncertain
      regulatory pathways. A risk they are unwilling to take. </p><p>Enter Moderna,
      a young start-up <a href=\"https://www.flagshippioneering.com/companies/moderna\"
      target=\"_blank\">founded</a> with venture capital. In 2013 Moderna receives
      up to 25 Million USD from DARPA. </p><p>DARPA often collaborates with young
      and innovative companies, especially in the fields of information-, communication-
      and biotechnology and often founded with venture capital. A very different industry
      landscape from the energy sector. </p><h3><strong>Begin at the end</strong></h3><p>If
      we look closer at DARPA and ARPA-E, it becomes even clearer that they are not
      your regular research funding agency. One aspect is very prominent, i.e. beginning
      with the end. It is about the result, a specific solution, that contributes
      to the mission. The agencies don\u2019t fund research for research\u2019s sake.
      They invest in technologies that they believe will contribute to national security
      / economic prosperity / environmental wellbeing. And so the starting point is
      the potential of a novel technology. DARPA is  very much about exploring, challenging
      and pushing novel technologies; it is not about basic science. </p><p>The intervention
      logic is not the common fund-research-and-breakthroughs-might-happen. It is
      more like: in order to get to a certain solution and to ensure national security,
      technological boundaries need to be pushed above and beyond the unimaginable,
      and by all means necessary. It\u2019s the DARPA program manager that leads the
      way. Or in case of ARPA-E the program director. Because at ARPA-E they don\u2019t
      just <em>manage</em>\r\nprograms, they are in the lead and thus <em>direct</em>.</p><h3><strong>Vision
      and religion </strong></h3><p>The \u201Cvision\u201D of the DARPA program manager
      and the \u201Creligion\u201D of the ARPA-E program director serve as a beacon.
      It is a combination of ideas, knowledge, expertise, networks and insight into
      the potential of a novel technology. And how combining all that can result into
      a completely novel solution. The program manager has far more responsibilities
      and possibilities than any officer at a regular research council. </p><p>A program
      manager is expected to develop programs and do so by engaging with DARPA (office)
      directors, the army, researchers at universities and government labs and private
      companies. It can take up to a year to develop a program, during which the program
      manager gains even more insight, establishes contacts and networks, engages
      with potential performers, and develops metrics. It is the responsibility of
      the program manager to select projects, and this might be with, or without,
      the help of others. The program manager decides on the program portfolio: one
      big project; a collection of projects; projects that are very much alike and
      that compete with each other, or rather projects that are complementary. And
      the program manager actively engages with the projects, pays visits, calls for
      meetings, arranges encounters and establishes networks. The program manager
      is not a bureaucrat to which one has to report on a yearly basis, on the contrary.
      </p><h3><strong>Contracts, performers and challenges</strong></h3><p>DARPA doesn\u2019t
      provide grants; DARPA works with contracts. And DARPA calls its contractors
      performers. And perform, they should. DARPA can require changes at any time.
      And it can cancel contracts on short notice and for whatever reason. </p><p>More
      recently, DARPA has introduced the format of a challenge. Here the conditions
      are even more uncertain. DARPA calls for teams to embark on a challenge, usually
      lasting weeks or even months. Only some of the finalists get a prize. Challenges
      have included a cyber grand challenge with a final online capture-the-flag competition
      live and on stage during DEF CON in Las Vegas.</p><p>And the chikungunya virus
      (CHIKV) Challenge.</p><p>In 2015 DARPA organises a challenge to develop accurate
      forecasts of where and when the chikungunya virus occurs. Almost forty teams
      participate in this half-year challenge. They develop and adapt their models
      and predictions, using real time data of actual infections. It is very exciting,
      according to the program manager, that teams build their models at the speed
      of an epidemic. And even more exciting that the challenge will lead to tools
      that work faster than the speed of an epidemic. </p><p>Eleven winners shared
      500,000 dollar of prize money, leaving the majority of teams empty handed. </p><h3><strong>Accounting
      for money </strong></h3><p>Talking about money, the annual budget of DARPA is
      3.5 billion USD, almost 3 billion Euro. To compare, the total <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/en/science-figures/investments/how-much-does-netherlands-spend-rd/funding-and-performance-rd\"
      target=\"_blank\">government spending for research and development</a> in the
      Netherlands is 5 billion Euro annually, less than double the DARPA budget. The
      seven year European framework program Horizon 2020 <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03598-2\"
      target=\"_blank\">allocated</a> nearly 60 billion Euro over 7 years. It was
      initially <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/sites/default/files/Factsheet_budget_H2020_0.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> to cost some 80 billion Euro total. Anyway,
      some 10 billion Euro per year. The budget of DARPA is substantial. It is very
      high risk, very high gain. Or high loss.</p><p>DARPA reports directly to US
      congress. In his <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/WalkerHASCIETCStatement28March2019.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">March 2019</a> statement, claiming the 2020 budget, the then
      director of DARPA presents a number of highlights. The very first he mentions?</p><p>Stopping
      pandemics in 60 days or less.</p><h3><strong>To DARPA, or not to DARPA</strong></h3><p>So
      you might think that I am an DARPA-advocate. No, I am not, on the contrary.
      </p><p>Let\u2019s have a look at the current global pandemic outbreak. We have
      seen presidents and other authorities deny the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic.
      The World Health Organisation <a href=\"https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-paris-peace-forum-spring-meeting-17-may-2021\"
      target=\"_blank\">concludes</a> that vaccines are very unevenly distributed
      across the globe, leading to a health risk for all, and calls it vaccine apartheid.
      Then there is vaccine hesitancy. To name but few of the many problems and challenges.
      What they have in common is that they do not require (just) a technological
      solution, on the contrary. It is about trust, social justice, equity. About
      taking into account societal, moral, legal and ethical aspects. <a href=\"https://myumi.ch/VaxTrustReport\"
      target=\"_blank\">Overcoming vaccine hesitancy requires </a>collaboration between
      public health officials and local, especially marginalized, communities. And
      honest communication about scientific limitations and uncertainties. It calls
      for the inclusion of citizens in vaccine advisory committees. And specific attention
      to social media and news outlets, so as to reduce misinformation and disinformation.
      </p><p>Talking about the Internet, another technology brought to you by DARPA.
      </p><p>What should be an inspiration is the very, let\u2019s say, engaging nature
      of DARPA and its program managers. Often research councils, medical charities,
      the European Commission and the like are at a distance from those they fund.
      Even in case of a thematic program that aims to contribute to a societal issue.
      Also, there is little contact between the projects in such a program. And so
      after four years the result is a number of PhD theses and articles, but not
      the contribution that required collaboration across projects and with next users,
      stakeholders, government agencies, private companies and the like. The hoped
      for and promised improvement, the novel guidelines, the new design approach.
      The way DARPA anticipates, summons, directs and connects is incomparable and
      is one way to effectively enter and conquer unchartered territories.</p><p>However,
      the scope of DARPA is limited and restricted to technology and national security
      only. It intervenes in our lives with unthought of devices and technologies,
      while neglecting almost everything that makes us, and our society, social, just,
      human.</p><p>Moreover, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/38.9.681\"
      target=\"_blank\">know</a> that technological solutions alone do not suffice
      to tackle societal challenges, such as the current pandemic. Other options than
      research might be the answer and we need to take far more aspects into account.</p><figure><img

      target=\"_blank\">learn</a> that Moderna is effective against new variants,
      but that is the same technological solution, again. More even access to vaccines,
      tests and treatments worldwide would reduce the development of new variants.
      That would be my preferred treatment.</p><p></p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/IicyiaPYGGI\"

      \                                               <p>Sometimes, bringing home
      a message requires a more visual approach. That\u2019s why recently, we teamed
      up with a graphic designer to create an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4635649\"
      target=\"_blank\">infographic on the <em>h</em>-index</a> \u2013 or rather,
      on the reasons why not to use the <em>h</em>-index.<br>In our experience with
      stakeholders in research evaluation, debates about the usefulness of the <em>h</em>-index
      keep popping up. This happens even in contexts that are more welcoming towards
      responsible research assessment. Of course, the <em>h</em>-index is well-known,
      as are its downsides. Still, the various issues around it do not yet seem to
      be common knowledge. At the same time, current developments in research evaluation
      propose more holistic approaches. Examples include the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-i-academic-value-is-more-than-performance\"
      target=\"_blank\">evaluative inquiry</a> developed at our own centre as well
      as approaches to <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/tags/strategy%20evaluation%20protocol\">evaluate
      academic institutions in context</a>. Scrutinizing the creation of indicators
      itself, better contextualization has been called for, <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2u254&title=st-indicators-in-the-wild-contextualisation-and-participation-for-responsible-metrics\"
      target=\"_blank\">demanding to derive them out \u201Cin the wild\u201D</a> and
      not in isolation.<br>Moving towards more comprehensive research assessment approaches
      that consider research in all its variants is supported <a href=\"https://researchonresearch.org/tpost/f1bfxzkiz1-new-rori-working-paper-the-changing-role\"
      target=\"_blank\">by the larger community of research evaluators</a> as well,
      making a compelling case to move away from single-indicator thinking.<br>Still,
      there is opposition to reconsidering the use of metrics. When first introducing
      the infographic on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahderijcke/status/1372951325340798981\"
      target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, this evoked responses questioning misuse of the
      <em>h</em>-index in practice, disparaging more qualitative assessments, or simply
      shrugging off responsibility for taking action due to a perceived lack of alternatives.
      This shows there is indeed a need for taking another look at the <em>h</em>-index.</p><h3>The
      <em>h</em>-index and researcher careers</h3><p>To begin with, the <em>h</em>-index
      only increases as time passes. This time-dependence means that the <em>h</em>-index
      favors more senior researchers over their younger colleagues. This becomes clearly
      apparent in the following (fictitious) case, which compares a researcher at
      a more advanced career stage to an early-career researcher. As can be seen in
      Figure 1, the researcher at the more advanced career stage has already published
      a substantial number of publications. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/h-index_img1.png\"
      data-image=\"19720\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      1. Publications of a researcher at a more advanced career stage. Publications
      can be seen on the x-axis and are represented on the right as well.</span></p><p>Over
      time, the publications depicted attract more and more citations (see the y-axis
      in Figure 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-2.png\"

      On the right: colored representations of citations received as they occur in
      other publications.</span></p><p>When ordering a researcher\u2019s list of publications
      by the (decreasing) number of citations received by each of them, you will get
      a distribution as in Figure 3. The value of the <em>h</em>-index equals the
      number of publications (N) that have received N or more citations. In our example,
      this results in an <em>h</em>-index of five.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-3.png\"
      data-image=\"19741\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      3. Calculating the h-index for a researcher at a more advanced career stage</span></p><p>The
      situation is less favorable for the early-career researcher. This is because
      the <em>h</em>-index does not account for academic age: researchers who have
      been around for a shorter amount of time fare worse with this metric. Hence,
      while the <em>h</em>-index provides an indication of a researcher\u2019s career
      stage, it does not enable fair comparisons of researchers that are at different
      career stages.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-4.png\"

      4. Calculating the h-index for an early-career researcher.</span></p><h3>The
      <em>h</em>-Index and field differences</h3><p>Another problem of the <em>h</em>-index
      is that it does not account for differences in publication and citation practices
      <em>between</em> and even <em>within</em> fields. A closer look at another hypothetical
      case may exemplify this issue. We are taking a look at two different fields
      of science: One with a low (Figure 5) and another one with a high publication
      and citation density (Figure 6). The researcher in the field with a low publication
      and citation density has an <em>h</em>-index of two, while the <em>h</em>-index
      equals five for the researcher in the field with a high publication and citation
      density. The difference in the <em>h</em>-indices of the two researchers does
      not reflect a difference in scientific performance. Instead, it simply results
      from differences in publication and citation practices between the fields in
      which the two researchers are active.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/h-index_img5.png\"

      the h-index for a researcher active in a field with a high publication and citation
      density.</span></p><h3>Three problems of the <em>h</em>-index</h3><p>The application
      of the <em>h</em>-index in research evaluation requires a critical assessment
      as well. Three problematic cases can be identified in particular (Figure 7).
      The first one, in which the <em>h</em>-index facilitates unfair comparisons
      of researchers, has already been discussed. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-7.png\"
      data-image=\"19750\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      7. Three problems of the h-index</span></p><p>The <em>h</em>-index favors researchers
      who have been active for a longer period of time. It also favors researchers
      from fields with a higher publication and citation density (Figure 8).</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-8.png\"
      data-image=\"19751\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      8. Problem 1: Unfair comparisons.</span></p><p>Another problem of the <em>h</em>-index
      is that merely publishing a lot becomes a \u2018virtue\u2019 in its own right.
      This means that researchers benefit from placing their name on as many publications
      as possible. This may lead to undesirable authorship behavior (Figure 9). Likewise,
      the strong emphasis of the <em>h</em>-index on citations may cause questionable
      citation practices.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-9.png\"
      data-image=\"19752\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      9. Problem 2: Bad publishing and referencing behavior.</span></p><p>There is
      yet another issue. By placing so much emphasis on publication output, the <em>h</em>-index
      narrows research evaluation down to just one type of academic activity. This
      runs counter to efforts towards a more responsible evaluation system that accounts
      for other types of academic activity as well: Leadership, vision, collaboration,
      teaching, clinical skills, or contributions to a research group or an institution
      (Figure 10). </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-10.png\"
      data-image=\"19753\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\"></span><span
      class=\"caption\">Figure 10. Problem 3: Invisibility of other academic activities.</span></p><p>Relying
      on just a single indicator is shortsighted and is likely to have considerable
      narrowing effects. Topical diversity may suffer since, as shown above, some
      fields of science are favored over others. Moreover, a healthy research system
      requires diverse types of talents and leaders, which means that researchers
      need to be evaluated in a way that does justice to the broad diversity in academic
      activities, rather than only on the basis of measures of publication output
      and citation impact. </p><h3>Halt the <em>h</em>-index and apply alternative
      approaches for evaluating researchers</h3><p>How then do we \u201Chalt the <em>h</em>-index\u201D?
      We would like to emphasize a threefold approach when it comes to evaluating
      academics (Figure 11). The starting point is a qualitative assessment by one\u2019s
      peers and colleagues. Adding to that, indicators applied in the assessment should
      be both transparent and flexible. Transparency means that the calculation of
      an indicator is clearly documented and that the data underlying an indicator
      are disclosed and made accessible. Thus, \u201Cblack box\u201D indicators are
      not acceptable. Regarding flexibility, the assessment should not apply a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019
      approach. Instead, it should adapt to the type of work done by a researcher
      and the specific context of the organization or the scientific field in which
      the researcher is active. Lastly, we believe that written justifications, e.g.
      narratives or personal statements, should become an important component in evaluations,
      including in the context of promotions or applications for grants. Such statements
      could for instance highlight the main accomplishments of researchers and their
      future plans.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Halt-the-h-index-11.png\"
      data-image=\"19754\" style=\"width:100%;\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure
      11. Evaluating academics in a responsible way.</span></p><p>In conclusion, evaluation
      of individual researchers should be seen as a qualitative process carried out
      by peers and colleagues. This process can be supported by quantitative indicators
      and qualitative forms of information, which together cover the various activities
      and roles of researchers. The use of a single unrepresentative, and in many
      cases even unfair, indicator based on publication and citation counts is not
      acceptable.</p><p>This conclusion very much aligns with calls for broader approaches
      towards <a href=\"https://vsnu.nl/recognitionandrewards/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Position-paper-Room-for-everyone%E2%80%99s-talent.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">recognition and rewards</a> in academia, and was also specified
      in the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/bibliometrics-the-leiden-manifesto-for-research-metrics-1.17351\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto</a>:</p><p><em>\u201CReading and judging
      a researcher's work is much more appropriate than relying on one number. Even
      when comparing large numbers of researchers, an approach that considers more
      information about an individual's expertise, experience, activities and influence
      is best.\u201D (Principle 7 in the Leiden Manifesto)</em></p><p>What remains

      target=\"_blank\">judge research units on their own merits</a> and putting the
      responsibility for the evaluation with the research organisations proves quite
      a challenge. Evaluation might not always happen according to protocol, yet the
      process itself offers opportunities to reflect and define. And as such it has
      value.</p><p>This blogpost is based on my long-term involvement with the SEP
      as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/nl_NL/werkgroep-sep.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">working group</a> SEP; on information shared during formal
      committee meetings; inputs from participants at workshops and briefing sessions;
      discussions with representatives of units preparing an evaluation; unpublished
      as well as published reviews of the SEP; as well as self-evaluation and assessment
      reports available online. Plus, it is informed by the evaluation of my own research
      units (past and current). Also, the new SEP 2021-2027 has become effective this
      year, so there is not much practice yet. However, most of what is addressed
      in this post has been part of previous protocols.</p><h3>Aims and strategy </h3><p>Evaluation
      takes place in light of the aims and strategy of the unit. This is nothing new,
      it has been part of the protocol for almost 20 years now. The current protocol
      puts even more emphasis on it, with its changed name (from Standard to Strategy)
      and a separate appendix that explains \u201Caims\u201D and \u201Cstrategy\u201D.</p><p>The
      issue is the assumption that units have a clear strategy. This is often not
      the case. Even when it has one, it is not always shared and known, nor does
      it guide decisions and choices. Some units, such as my <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">own</a>, organise internal meetings to prepare for the evaluation.
      We jointly develop an understanding of the past and uncover, or maybe recover,
      our strategy. Other units <a href=\"https://www.knaw.nl/nl/actueel/publicaties/trust-but-verify\"
      target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a>\r\nuse the moment not so much to look back,
      but to develop a joint vision for the future. </p><p>Having said that, in the
      past units described broad, common and vague goals, such as excellent, interdisciplinary,
      or international, or more <a href=\"https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/Report%20research%20review%20public%20administration%20%202014-2019.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">recently</a>\r\n\u201Cimprove internationalisation, innovation
      and rigour in research\u201D and \u201Cstrengthen societal relevance, integrity,
      and diversity.\u201D</p><h3>Indicator? What indicator?!</h3><p>The 2015 and
      2021 protocols only describe categories of evidence and mention exemplary indicators
      for each category. A unit should present and explain its own selection of indicators,
      that fit the unit\u2019s context and strategy. </p><p>Some perceive the indicators
      as a given and <a href=\"https://www.onderzoekerij.nl/onderzoeksbeoordeling/\"
      target=\"_blank\">mention</a> they are unaware that those are just samples.
      This, although it is mentioned explicitly and repeatedly, for instance, six
      times in the table with categories of evidence in the <a href=\"http://vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP2015-2021.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">2015 protocol</a> (Figure 1). On the other hand, this misperception
      might not come as a surprise, given the strict requirements of so many other
      evaluations.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/SEP_4_Figure1.png\"
      alt=\"SEP 4 Figure1\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Table D1 output indicators from
      the previous SEP 2015-2021.</figcaption></figure><p>Also, it is a huge challenge
      to define proper indicators for research quality and societal impact. At CWTS,
      we are quite aware of this. But most researchers are not experts in meaningful
      metrics; their expertise is Caribbean archeology, political economy or chemical
      biology. And yet they are asked to develop their own indicators. The nationwide
      initiative <em>Quality and Relevance in the Humanities</em> (<a href=\"https://www.qrih.nl/en/sep-evaluation\"
      target=\"_blank\">QRIH</a>) has taken action and developed sample indicators
      for SEP evaluations. It has identified indicators for all categories. Some are
      authorized by a panel; others have been used in a self-evaluation report. </p><h3>Novel
      aspects</h3><p>Over the years novel aspects that reflect developments and debates
      have become part of the protocol. They include research integrity, diversity
      and Open Science. </p><p>The necessity to address these issues is not always
      clear to the unit, nor to the committee.&nbsp;To illustrate this, one committee
      <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjM85PKusHwAhUU6OAKHQ9sAksQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uu.nl%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fwijsbegeerte_-_20190418_assessment_report_philosophy_def.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2YF29p7LhX4AmQFkcp8iYt\"
      target=\"_blank\">remarked</a>\r\nthat integrity is less a problem in the humanities
      than in the natural sciences, and even less so in their discipline, since research
      \u201Cseems inseparable from the individuality of whoever is doing it.\u201D&nbsp;However,
      the 2015 protocol that was in use back then, specifically mentions \u201Cself-reflection
      on actions (including in the supervision of PhD candidates)\u201D and \u201Cany
      dilemmas [\u2026] that have arisen and how the unit has dealt with them.\u201D
      I don\u2019t understand how that doesn\u2019t apply.</p><p>Other times the protocol
      asks for more than a unit is allowed to provide. It is unlawful to register
      an employee\u2019s ethnic or cultural background in the Netherlands, yet the
      protocol includes these dimensions in its definition of diversity. And while
      many are aware of the lack of ethnical and cultural diversity, there is discomfort
      addressing this, if only because of legal issues. </p><h3>The relevance of societal
      relevance</h3><p>Societal relevance, a subject that I have <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scv023\"
      target=\"_blank\">studied</a>\r\nfor some time now, proves challenging for units
      and committees. Sometimes the assessment focuses on structures and collaborations,
      i.e., on strategy; sometimes on products and results without any explanation
      for this emphasis; sometimes on societal issues that could benefit from the
      research, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiP4Z2Qu8HwAhWmA2MBHTggCUsQFjACegQIBhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uu.nl%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FReport%2520research%2520review%2520public%2520administration%2520%25202014-2019.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0Ly1Hd6vmSOJLADllz2gKX\"
      target=\"_blank\">sometimes</a> on the inherent and potential relevance: \u201C[the]
      research themes/specializations [\u2026] are explicitly relevant to society
      and the co-creation of public value.\u201D</p><p>Nowadays the necessity of a
      separate criterion for societal relevance isn\u2019t questioned anymore, yet
      the seemingly relative importance <a href=\"https://www.onderzoekerij.nl/onderzoeksbeoordeling/\"
      target=\"_blank\">is</a>. Which is odd, given that the three criteria (the other
      two are research quality and viability) are not weighed against each other.
      Societal relevance might be a substantive element of the mission of some units
      and it might be hardly of importance for others.</p><h3>The quality of research
      quality</h3><p>The protocols describe research quality only briefly. This leaves
      room for interpretation. Browsing through assessment reports, it is striking
      to see the many references to publications and publication strategies as a proxy
      for research quality and strategy. One committee <a href=\"https://www.uu.nl/media/34186\"
      target=\"_blank\">observes</a>&nbsp;a trend across an entire discipline \u201Ctowards
      valuing quality over quantity\u201D and that \u201Cresearchers are no longer
      encouraged to publish as many articles as possible\u201D. Yet the shift still
      relates to publications, since researchers \u201Care stimulated to submit primarily
      top-quality papers in high impact journals.\u201D Followed by a discussion of
      citation rates and interdisciplinary research. </p><h3>National evaluation in
      context</h3><p>There is a tension between a joint evaluation across a discipline
      and the intention to evaluate in context. The initial VSNU protocols of the
      1990s<sup>1</sup>\r\nprescribed a joint evaluation. One goal, abandoned since
      2003, was to ascertain the scientific potential of a discipline. Yet the practice
      of joint evaluations still exists. It is partly rooted in the <a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/2018-02-01\"
      target=\"_blank\">law</a> that requires assessment \u201Cin collaboration as
      far as possible with other institutions.\u201D</p><p>A joint evaluation requires
      representatives of a discipline, involving anywhere between 2-9 universities,
      to jointly take action, discuss and decide. Although unintended, this results
      in an extra practice of negotiating quality and relevance. It also requires
      one assessment committee only. One reason to abandon the mandatory joint evaluation
      was that it is hardly possible for one committee to do justice to each and every
      unit. And with the increased focus on the context of the unit, its mission,
      goals and strategy, this is even more so the case.</p><h3>Between intention
      and practice</h3><p>For this blogpost, I have browsed through reports and used
      my own involvement with the SEP. The result is a very sketchy picture of examples
      and instances that indicate a difference between intention and practice. It
      certainly is not a thorough analysis. And yes, there are evaluations where issues
      are addressed according to the protocol, with ample attention for argumentation
      and strategy. Also, I don\u2019t want to condemn any practice, on the contrary.
      Rather I want to nuance the <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/dear-ref-please-may-we-have-a-sep/\"
      target=\"_blank\">enthusiasm</a>\r\nof some.</p><p>And we shouldn\u2019t neglect
      what happens during an evaluation. It has repeatedly been <a href=\"https://www.knaw.nl/nl/actueel/publicaties/e-va-lu-e-ren\"
      target=\"_blank\">reported</a>\r\nthat units use an evaluation to re-define
      and re-adjust their mission, goals and strategy. And even when an evaluation
      isn\u2019t fully done according to protocol, those involved go through the motions,
      encounter obstacles, end up in discussions and ultimately negotiate and establish
      notions of quality and relevance. The execution and result of that process might
      not always be excellent, but we shouldn\u2019t neglect the benefit of those
      efforts. </p><p>A new protocol will not change a community overnight. However,
      it urges boards, units and committees to address novel aspects and practices.
      More on that in the next blogpost.</p><p></p><p><sup>1</sup> VSNU (1993). <em>Quality

      it allows me to study scientific collaboration in an applied research setting
      as part of an international research consortium that trains PhD graduates funded
      by a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/research-networks_en\"

      which is coordinated by an international consortium. Although the focus is more
      on research, I believe that there are some similarities between ITNs and Erasmus
      Mundus; for example, there is mobility within various organisations in several
      countries, with various researchers and lecturers serving as part of one student
      cohort. An overview of Train<sup>2</sup>Wind is available on this <a href=\"https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/199915800/PO136_Train2Wind_WindEuropeOffshore_CPH_2019.pdf\"

      by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and includes the University of
      Bergen, University of Copenhagen (UCPH), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
      Lausanne, and the University of T\xFCbingen. The partner organisations are Johns

      collaboration is an important part of conducting research, especially for research
      consortia, because the consortium members depend on each other to achieve the
      project\u2019s goals. My PhD work centers on expectations and experiences regarding
      scientific collaboration in PhD training networks in the research area of wind
      energy. I will study the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13142-012-0174-z\"

      bibliometric databases, and online social networks. The first step will be to
      carry out qualitative interviews with ITN project members. This will be followed

      The webinar was organized into the following three panels with a moderated discussion
      at the end of each panel.</p><p>Panel 1 \u201CDebates on social media\u201D
      included presentations on \u201CCOVID-19 publications: Citation indexes and
      altmetrics\u201D by <strong>Mike Thelwall</strong> (University of Wolverhampton);
      \u201CMedia coverage of COVID-19 research\u201D by <strong>Mike Taylor </strong>(Digital
      Science), and \u201CAssessing the risks of \"infodemics\" in response to COVID-19
      epidemics\u201D by <strong>Riccardo Gallotti </strong>(Bruno Kessler Foundation
      \u2013 FBK, Trento).</p><p>Panel 2 \u201ESocietal questions\u201C provided a
      rich perspective through the following presentations. \u201CHow scientific research
      reacts to international public health emergencies: a global analysis of response
      patterns\u201D by <strong>Lin Zhang</strong> (Wuhan University); \u201CEarly
      signals of a widening gender gap in publication frequency during the COVID-19
      pandemic\u201D by <strong>Jens Peter Andersen</strong>\r\n(Aarhus University),
      and \"Consolidation in a crisis: patterns of international collaboration in
      COVID-19 research\" by <strong>Caroline Wagner</strong> (Ohio State University).</p><p>Finally,
      Panel 3, entitled \u201CMapping COVID-19 research\u201C focused on the following
      talks. \u201CThe COVID-19 Open Research Dataset\u201D was described by <strong>Lucy
      Wang</strong> and <strong>Kyle Lo </strong>(Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute
      for AI); \u201CTracking the growth of COVID-19 preprints\u201D was presented
      by <strong>Nicholas Fraser</strong> (ZBW Leibniz Information Centre for Economics),
      and <strong>Simon Porter</strong> (Digital Science) dived deeper into \u201CCOVID-19
      and preprint publishing culture\u201D.</p><p>Based on the positive feedback
      on the first edition, we started a<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/events?article=n-s2r244&title=doing-science-in-times-of-crisis-science-studies-perspectives-on-covid-19-2nd-edition\"></a><a

      feedback from the 1st edition was taken into account to develop the webinar
      series further, for example, an additional focus was set on knowledge graphs,
      and we invited two speakers for that purpose. The 2nd edition was again structured
      into three panels with a moderated discussion at the end of each panel.</p><p>The
      speaker line up for Panel 1 \u201CPandemic effect\u201C was as follows. <strong>Milad
      Haghani</strong>  (University of Sydney) presented on \u201CCovid-19 pandemic
      and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly efforts prompted by a health
      crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS, MERS and 2019-nCov literature\u201D;
      <strong>Wei Yang Tham</strong> (Harvard University) focused on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5446/48253\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u201CQuantifying the Immediate Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic
      on Scientists\u201D</a>, and <strong>Serge Horbach</strong> (Aarhus University)
      reported on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5446/50501\" target=\"_blank\">\u201CPandemic
      Publishing: Medical journals strongly speed up their publication process for

      Simon Lohse</strong> (Leibniz University Hannover) presented together on \u201CEpistemological
      aspects of evidence-based health policy: the case of Covid-19\u201D, and finally
      <strong>Goran Muri\u0107</strong> (University of Southern California) talked

      amplifies gender disparities in research\u201D</a>.</p><p>Panel 2 \u201CSocial
      media\u201C included the following two presentations. \u201CCOVID-19 research
      and social media\u201D was introduced by <strong>Rodrigo Costas</strong> (Leiden
      University), and <strong>Anders Blok</strong> (University of Copenhagen) talked
      about <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5446/50503\" target=\"_blank\">\u201CHow
      We Tweet About Coronavirus, and Why: A Computational Anthropological Mapping
      of Political Attention on Danish Twitter during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201D</a>.</p><p>The
      final session, Panel 3 \u201COpen science/open research\u201D focused on a call
      for open science, and the above-mentioned knowledge graphs. For that, <strong>Jan
      Homolak</strong> (University of Zagreb) presented on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5446/50502\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u201DPreliminary analysis of COVID-19 academic information
      patterns: a call for open science in the times of closed borders\u201D</a>;
      <strong>Jennifer D'Souza</strong> (TIB Leibniz Information Centre for Science
      and Technology) introduced \u201CCovid-19 Bioassays in the Open Research Knowledge
      Graph\u201D, and finally <strong>Maria-Esther Vidal</strong> (TIB Leibniz Information
      Centre for Science and Technology) described <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5446/50500\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u201CHow Do Knowledge Graphs Contribute to Understanding
      COVID-19 Related Treatments?\u201D</a>.</p><h3>Connecting the community</h3><p>The
      webinar included diverse speakers and an audience from the science studies community
      and beyond. As in all current events, participation from around the world is
      possible due to the virtual format. We believe that the webinar provided an
      opportunity to connect COVID-19 science studies research and that the participants
      could benefit from the presentations and discussions. A 3 hours event structured
      into three panels seems to be an appropriate format for this purpose, although
      the different time zones of the organizers and participants are sometimes challenging.</p><p>Finally,
      some presentation videos of the 2nd edition were edited by <a href=\"https://projects.tib.eu/en/conrec/\"
      target=\"_blank\">TIB Conference Recording Service</a> and published at the
      <a href=\"https://av.tib.eu/series/990\" target=\"_blank\">TIB AV-Portal</a>,
      a platform for scientific videos and events. We would like to thank especially
      the engaged speakers who swiftly accepted our invitation to present at the webinars.</p><p><em>Header

      from home can be a lonely experience. Sometimes, you just wish to have a \u2018real\u2019
      chat with a colleague. Therefore, the CWTS-colleagues from the city of Utrecht
      started experimenting with socially distant lunch walks. It turns out \u2013
      this is going pretty well!</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>This blogpost is a follow-up
      of the post by Ed Noyons <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/going-back-to-normal\"
      target=\"_blank\">Going back to normal?</a>, published almost a year ago. Back
      then, he discussed the impact of COVID-19 on work conditions and proposed the
      idea of rethinking all the commuting we were doing in \u2018normal' times. </p><h3>So,
      what is happening one year later?</h3><p>As COVID-19 turned our world into a
      more physically distant one, many people maintain social, educational, and workplace
      contact via online meetings and conferencing. On the one hand, we are able to
      deal with the current situation, having appropriate facilities for almost all
      of us to stay and work in our homes. However, in the long term, the virus's
      growing impact on people\u2019s well-being is noticeable and a little change
      in daily routine can make the difference in our personal life as well as in
      our professional life and work performance. For many people, working from home
      can be a lonely enterprise in this era of social distancing and one thing still
      remains: the desire to have a \u2018real\u2019 chat with a colleague. Therefore,
      among the many initiatives at CWTS, there is one I like in particular: the lunch
      walks. </p><h3>What is it all about?</h3><p>A previous study in the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28358570/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Journal of Occupational Health Psychology</a> found that taking
      a short walk during a lunch break might allow employees a rest from the cognitive
      process required during the workday, which becomes even more relevant in a home-working
      situation. Our colleague Inge van der Weijden&nbsp;put this idea into action
      and suggested a weekly schedule for all CWTS staff living in Utrecht and willing
      to participate. But that was no issue at all, everyone was very enthusiastic
      about this initiative! </p><p>From February on, the first schedule was drafted
      for the coming four weeks in which everyone was paired up with someone else
      once a week. The Utrecht team was also formed: Bram, Carole, Ed, Inge, Leonie,
      Rinze, and Sonia (and Tim, who joined us later in March). We decided to call
      ourselves the \u2018Utrecht Squadron\u2019. </p><h3>How did we experience it?</h3><p>Bram
      and Ed met for the first time in real life for a lunch walk in <a href=\"https://lunetten.nl/\"

      know each other, but as to be expected, there is so much more to discuss that
      they are already looking forward to the next session.</p><p>The same week, Leonie
      and I also had a nice walk along the <a href=\"https://www.ontdek-utrecht.nl/de-singel-is-rond/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Singel.</a> Unavoidably, our discussion turned to the question
      of how to make sense of all those informal activities as well when it comes
      to <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/tags/research%20evaluation\" target=\"_blank\">evaluating
      research organizations</a>. After all, you would think that they can be quite
      important! Only how do you account for them?</p><p>The week after, in a park
      in between their homes, Inge and Ed met for a short walk during lunch and a
      coffee to go. Such a nice way to get things off your chest and to look for opportunities
      in the future!&nbsp;On the most beautiful day of the year, Ed and I walked along
      the Singel in Utrecht. A wonderful track around the city centre, where we discussed
      extensively the new challenges raised by managing projects and our lives.</p><figure><img

      socially distant walk due to slippery conditions, Inge and Leonie decided not
      to meet in person. Instead, they had an hour-long phone conversation, while
      walking in <a href=\"https://www.utrecht.nl/wonen-en-leven/bouwen/bouwprojecten/leidsche-rijn/buurten/leidsche-rijn-centrum/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leidsche Rijn</a>\r\n(Inge) and Oost (Leonie). The huge snowman
      around the corner from where Leonie lives served as a stand-in for Inge. So
      now the research question is: did both of them walk 4.4 km? Inge did, according
      to her \u2018Stappenteller app\u2019. Did Leonie as well?</p><p>The week after,
      Rinze and Leonie had a non-scheduled walk. They talked about the practice of
      the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/research-evaluation-in-context-1-introducing-research-evaluation-in-the-netherlands\"
      target=\"_blank\">Strategy Evaluation Protocol</a>, about societal impact and
      recognition and rewards. Well, anyone who knows them could have guessed that\u2026</p><p>The
      same week, Bram and Inge had a sunny walk in Lombok and Oog in Al while one
      week later, Bram and Leonie had a very pleasant and sunny walk in Amelisweerd.
      They talked about the controversial A27 project in the beautiful surroundings
      of Amelisweerd, and about being new at CWTS and starting a new job in times
      of Corona. Sonia and Ed explored the city centre together and enjoyed a pumpkin
      and onion soup while talking about Sonia\u2019s current and future projects
      at CWTS. The last week of February, Inge and I had a walk at the \u2018Muntgebouw\u2019
      in Utrecht where we discussed the progress of institute projects we are working
      on together.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/ed_inge_utrecht.jpg\"

      lunchwalk.</figcaption></figure><h3>Exchanging with colleagues in real-life
      settings</h3><p>Thank you, Inge, for taking the lead in organizing these lunch
      walks! Breaking the working day with an outdoor activity such as walking is
      a great way to cope with the strange circumstances that we are all in. Not to
      forget about the health aspects, of course. It might be for a reason that Leiden
      University invited its members&nbsp;for a <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/dossiers/healthy-university/healthy-university-week-2020/ommetje-application\"
      target=\"_blank\">walking competition</a> as part of its <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/dossiers/healthy-university/healthy-university-week-2020\"
      target=\"_blank\">health week</a>&nbsp;in early March. Emphasizing more the
      aspect of exchange, the University of Amsterdam also introduced a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UvA_Amsterdam/status/1357014546607730690\"
      target=\"_blank\">walking activity</a> for its students only recently. For me,
      the lunch walks are a great opportunity to keep each other informed on our daily
      activities and current research projects. And I think - with these obvious benefits,
      the impact of those informal exchanges cannot be valued high enough. But as
      long as we don\u2019t step up our selfie-game, it will likely be impossible
      to keep track of all of that. Some things are just difficult to measure\u2026</p><p><em>Header

      is a well-known and widely used software tool visualising quantitative data.
      Learning to use all VOSviewer\u2019s features through guided instruction was
      an exceptional and new experience for us. In this post, we share some of our
      recent experiences in mastering our science mapping skills.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>The
      course \u201CVisualising Science Using VOSviewer\u201D</h3><p>VOSviewer was
      developed to construct various networks based on scientific literature. One
      type of maps is co-occurrence networks of essential terms. They provide an overview
      of the topics in the publications. Other networks are bibliometric; they are
      based on co-authorship or citations. Such maps represent connections between
      researchers, their institutions, countries, or journals and individual papers.
      Researchers worldwide use VOSviewer to create, visualise, and explore networks
      based on textual and bibliographical data.</p><p>To be sure, it is easy enough
      to start using VOSviewer and learn how to employ all the available features
      independently. The <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer
      </a>website contains a comprehensive manual and advice on getting started. It
      also provides numerous examples and links to additional relevant sources.</p><p>However,
      the tool\u2019s developers\u2014CWTS bibliometrics researchers Ludo Waltman
      and Nees Jan van Eck\u2014also hold an annual course to help researchers familiarise
      themselves with VOSviewer. What could be better than a course run by the developers
      of the tool you want to use efficiently? For us, it was an excellent opportunity
      which took only four afternoons, but our proficiency improved considerably.<br></p><h3>Fostering
      the learning progress</h3><p>Before the world was forced to move online, it
      seemed impossible to many of us to learn new things effectively via online classes.
      But for Visualising Science Using VOSviewer, the online format posed few problems
      and had some unique benefits.</p><p>For one thing, holding the course online
      made it possible for participants to communicate with others from all over the
      world. When we got some time for introductions and informal chats, we found
      out that it was an early morning for the Americans and almost night time for
      the South Koreans. Besides sharing our interests in VOSviewer, we talked about
      snowy weather, music and hobbies (\u201CAre these guitars behind you real?\u201D),
      and so forth.</p><p>Even though the lecturers advised us to use the datasets
      most relevant to our investigations, they also prepared some that we could use
      in our practice sessions. They offered a well-structured package of comprehensive
      course material.</p><p>The course itself took place via Microsoft Teams, and
      when somebody was struggling to comment in Teams, Ludo and Nees created a Slack
      channel. It was convenient for participants to have an additional communication
      channel with lecturers for questions and answers. Even after the course ended,
      activities in the Slack group have continued so far.</p><p>Participants varied
      in their research backgrounds and in their ability to move from one unknown
      feature to another. Even so, this course has a very pleasant balance. We comfortably
      moved from listening to theoretical knowledge all together to doing practical
      assignments in smaller groups. When problems arose, anyone could share their
      screens and seek immediate, expert help and attention from Ludo or Nees. In
      this way, we not only efficiently solved our own issues but also learned from
      others. Finally, over the course, we gained more ideas on how to further explore
      our datasets.</p><p>Moreover, those who elaborated on advanced projects or just
      needed more time for clarifications were able to set up individual consultations
      with Ludo or Nees, who devoted time so that everyone had all their enquiries
      answered. This option benefited participants significantly.</p><h3>Coming feature
      of VOSviewer: online presence</h3><p>At the last session, we had the fantastic
      opportunity to create our maps using a beta version of VOSviewer Online. This
      allowed us to share our discoverable networks with anyone curious to examine
      them further. Below you can find the maps we created over the course in VOSviewer
      Online.</p><p>Eleonora was curious about looking at the national accomplishments
      of her home country, Lithuania. She created traditional co-authorship networks
      of countries collaborating with Lithuania, based on bibliographical data downloaded
      from the Web of Science Core Collection:<br></p><p></p><figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\"

      in her mapping skills, so she shared her <a href=\"https://eleonoradagiene.lt/lietuvos-mokslo-bendrakeleiviai/\"
      target=\"_blank\">networks</a> with Lithuanian readers.</p><p>Qianqian likes
      an overlay visualisation, another VOSviewer network functionality. The overlay
      map can, for example, clearly show the changing pattern of terms over time.
      This is useful as it reflects the development of a particular research area.
      Such visualisations are vital for studying the evolutionary trend, trajectory,
      and research front of a given field.</p><p>Qianqian wanted to look at research
      on \u201Ccardiovascular disease\u201D at a glance, so she downloaded data on
      \u201Ccardiovascular disease\u201D between 2018 to 2020 from the Web of Science
      Core Collection. Below, you can see the term overlay visualisation map that
      resulted from this data:<br></p><figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://app.vosviewer.com/?map=https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Vx0jt95Mt0kVHZV-aB9JlfuQC_TBvPdb&network=https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1l7Y1jtf4jLkkrj6bKwWc56KplnIdvxCz&item_color=2&simple_ui=true\"
      width=\"100%\" height=\"75%\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; max-width: 1000px;
      min-height: 500px\"></iframe></figure><p>The overlay map created by Qianqian
      presents the development of cardiovascular disease research over three years.&nbsp;It
      shows that an initial focus on obesity research shifted to infections.&nbsp;The
      colour scale reflects average publication dates for each term (in our case it
      is between 2018 and 2020), and endpoints were set automatically by VOSviewer.
      Thus, some terms in yellow have an average date considerably later in the dataset,
      and some terms in dark blue have an earlier average date.</p><p>Learning to
      use all VOSviewer\u2019s features through guided instruction was an exceptional
      and new experience for both of us. Through this course, we systematically mastered
      science mapping skills that will enhance our research projects. VOSviewer is
      a magnificent and freely downloadable tool that could expand your own analysis.
      You can learn how to use it individually or with a group by participating in

      is the procedure for the evaluation of academic research? What are the roles
      and responsibilities of those involved? This is the 3rd post in a series on
      research evaluation in the Netherlands and is dedicated to the Strategy Evaluation
      Protocol 2021-2027.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>In
      a <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/research-evaluation-in-context-2-one-joint-protocol-three-criteria-and-four-aspects\"
      target=\"_blank\">previous post</a> the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">SEP 2021-2027</a> was introduced. As a reminder: the Association
      of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU), the Netherlands Organisation for
      Scientific Research (NWO) and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences
      (KNAW) share the responsibility for the evaluation of all academic research
      units. According to the SEP 2021-2027, research units are evaluated in the light
      of their context, aims and strategy. Also, an evaluation should be understood
      as integral part of ongoing quality assurance. Evaluation is intended to reflect
      and learn, it is of formative nature. </p><h3>The board is responsible and commissions
      the evaluation,\u2026</h3><p>The board of an academic research performing organisation
      is responsible for the evaluation. This includes ensuring that all its research
      units are evaluated once every six years. It also includes commissioning the
      evaluation, determining the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the evaluation, appointing
      an assessment committee and ensuring follow-up. </p><p>The board develops the
      ToR for each evaluation, specifying the aims, criteria, procedure and schedule
      of the evaluation. Most of it is laid down in the protocol, but the board can
      add extra aspects or evaluation questions. These might relate to everything
      and anything: a recent reorganisation of the unit; the upcoming retirement of
      key staff; novel, maybe potentially disruptive, research opportunities; external
      funding, etc. The board also appoints the assessment committee, after consultation
      with the unit. </p><h3>\u2026 the research unit provides evidence in the form
      of a self-evaluation report\u2026</h3><p>Given the attention for context, aims
      and strategy, the research unit has considerable influence in the evaluation
      process. And that is intentionally. After all, the evaluation takes place in
      light of the aims, strategy and context of the unit. </p><p>The unit is asked
      to write a so-called self-evaluation report. It is, in fact, more a concise
      report in which the unit presents itself. The aims and strategy of the unit
      are central. With the aims and strategy as a reference, the unit describes the
      achievements of the past six years and it presents future plans. All this in
      20 pages or less, and written as a coherent and narrative argument. </p><h3>\u2026
      - with indicators of choice - \u2026.</h3><p>That\u2019s not all. The unit is
      asked to identify and present forms of evidence that underpin its argument in
      a robust way. In other words: the unit itself chooses indicators that best fit
      its context, aims and strategy. It should present the indicators in the report,
      explain the choice for the indicators and explain how these indicators relate
      to the unit\u2019s aims and strategy.</p><p>The protocol doesn\u2019t prescribe
      the use of certain indicators, on the contrary; it leaves room for plurality.
      It merely presents potential indicators. However, the protocol mentions six
      categories for which the unit is expected to present evidence: Research products
      for peers (1) and for societal target groups (2); Demonstrable use of products
      by peers (3) and by societal target groups (4); Marks of recognition from peers
      (5) and by societal target groups (6). </p><p>There is but one restriction:
      it is not allowed to use the Journal Impact Factor. And there is a firm warning
      against the use of the H-index. The protocol refers to the <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/read/\"
      target=\"_blank\">DORA declaration</a> and presents arguments for these choice.</p><h3>\u2026
      with a number of annexes\u2026..</h3><p>The annexes to the self-evaluation report
      contains basic information, such as number of staff, funding and PhD candidates.
      It also contains the evidence to the self-chosen indicators. </p><p>Moreover,
      the annex should contain a number of case studies. These cases can relate to
      anything specific that the unit considers important, such as particular projects
      or programmes, how the unit has organized its interaction between research activities
      and society or between research and the PhD programmes. Note that these cases
      don\u2019t need to relate to societal impact per se. Yet the protocol mentions
      that the case studies are pre-eminently suited to indicate the connection between
      the academic and the societal. A connection, the protocol explains, that is
      seen as essential in many academic domains and disciplines. </p><p>A final annex,
      that comes closest to a self-evaluation, is a \u201CSWOT\u201D analysis. The
      unit is asked to analyze its own strengths and weaknesses, and to identify external
      opportunities and threats. The SWOT analysis should be used to inform the strategy
      for the years to come.</p><h3>\u2026 and an independent assessment committee,\u2026<br></h3><p>For
      each evaluation, a dedicated and independent assessment committee is appointed.
      The unit is expected to propose members. After all, the unit is evaluated in
      light of its own context, aims and strategy. However the board decides, can
      remove an add members, and formally appoints the committee. </p><p>The committee
      as a whole (not every member separately) should be able to assess the unit,
      all criteria and every aspect. It should be diverse, in terms of gender and
      cultural, national and disciplinary background. It is advised to include a non-academic
      expert, but this is not required. There are only two strict requirements: at
      least one PhD candidate and one early-/mid-career researcher have to be part
      of the assessment committee. </p><p>The committee is supported by an independent
      secretary. The secretary should have experience with assessment processes within
      the context of scientific research in the Netherlands. Moreover, the secretary
      should be independent of the board and the research unit. </p><h3>\u2026 based
      on the self-evaluation and a site-visit,\u2026</h3><p>The committee is expected
      to come to its assessment based on the documentation and a site-visit. The documentation
      includes the self-evaluation report with annexes, as well as the previous assessment
      report. </p><p>During the site-visit the committee members meet with representatives
      of the research unit (management and researchers, including research leaders;
      tenured and temp staff; PhD candidates), as well as with representatives of
      the research organisation and external partners. This allows to verify and supplement
      the information provided in the self-evaluation. </p><p>In some cases the visit
      takes place on neutral grounds, for instance when a number of universities collaborate
      in a nationwide evaluation. And in recent months, because of the restrictions
      due to the pandemic, the site-visits took place virtually, online. However,
      the idea is that a site-visit allows the committee to take the situation on
      site, including the infrastructure, into account.</p><h3>\u2026 formulates its
      assessment\u2026</h3><p>The committee presents its assessment in a written report.
      It should be a sharp, discerning and clear assessment. It should describe positive
      issues and \u2013 very distinctly, but constructively \u2013 weaknesses and
      suggest improvements. The text should give a clear assessment regarding all
      criteria and aspects. In case extra aspects were addressed in the self-evaluation
      report or the ToR, the committee is expected to address these in the assessment
      report as well.</p><h3>\u2026 upon which the board formulates a position and
      ensures follow-up.</h3><p>The committee submits the report to the board, upon
      which the board formulates a position. The board is expected to reflect on the
      assessment and to state how it will follow up on the assessment. The SEP 2021-2027
      positions evaluation as part of ongoing quality assurance in the research performing
      organisation, even more so than before. It urges the board to discuss the assessment
      outcome and potential actions with the unit, and to use the report as a reference
      in the years to come. </p><p>The board needs to follow-up on the evaluation
      in a different way as well. For public accountability reasons, the board is
      required to publish the evaluation portfolio on in its website. This includes
      a summary of the self-evaluation report, the case studies, the assessment report
      and the position document of the board. </p><h3>And what about the follow-up
      of this series?</h3><p>This and the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/research-evaluation-in-context-2-one-joint-protocol-three-criteria-and-four-aspects\"
      target=\"_blank\">previous post</a> describe the formal procedure, goals and
      criteria of an evaluation, as described in the current Strategy Evaluation Protocol
      2021-2027. The text of the SEP 2021-2027 has been a major source for both blog
      posts. But there is  more to understanding research evaluation in context /
      in the Netherlands. So a <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/research-evaluation-in-context-4-the-practice-of-research-evaluation\"
      target=\"_blank\">future blog</a> post will be dedicated to the practice - or
      should one say the challenges? - of research evaluation in context. And another
      one to the practice of designing a protocol, that is responsive to developments
      and concerns in research (policy). </p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Leonie

      target=\"_blank\">warned in a comment in Nature</a>, <em>\"So far, disparate

      the significance of the problem of predatory publishing, <a href=\"http://www.qoam.eu\"

      OMICS reflects the material damage this publisher caused over the years 2011
      to 2017. Given the <a href=\"https://predatoryjournals.com/publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">long
      list of predatory publishers</a>, it seems only a modest guess to multiply this
      $7 million per year by 3 to have an indication of the harm caused by all of
      them together, making it roughly $20 million annually. This figure might be
      growing under the current publication pressure, while, at the same time, predatory
      journals simply pass the compliance test of the newly launched <a href=\"https://journalcheckertool.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Plan S Journal Checker Tool</a>.</p><p>On top of that is the
      immaterial, hard to quantify damage to the reputation of misled authors and
      falsely advertised editors and reviewers. This affects the authority of the
      whole fabric of science. \u201C<em>Publications using such practices may call
      into question the credibility of the research they report,</em>\u201D <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-011.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">according to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>.
      Predatory journals contaminate the scientific and scholarly domain with fake
      news in a period in which the integrity of science may be more important than
      ever.</p><p>Also, niche journals outside the mainstream of the highly branded
      portfolios of the big publishing houses are at risk. Jan Erik Frantsv\xE5g conducted
      a thorough analysis of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18710/KCL56N\" target=\"_blank\">journals
      removed from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a> in their 2016
      grand cleansing operation. His resonating conclusion is that \u201C<em>there
      is nothing [\u2026] that indicates that the journals that were removed were
      of inferior scholarly quality compared to those remaining.</em>\u201D In such

      target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://kscien.org/predatory.php\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).
      Conversely, creating a list of trustworthy journals outcasts honest journals
      that did not make it to the list. Other attempts concern lists of criteria for
      \u2018predatory-ness\u2019, leaving it to individual researchers to check a
      specific journal (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02763869.2020.1693205\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> (paywalled) and <a href=\"https://app.lib.uliege.be/compass-to-publish/\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>). </p><p>Recently, QOAM in cooperation with CWTS,
      launched a new initiative: <a href=\"http://www.qoam.org/bfj\" target=\"_blank\">Bona
      Fide Journals</a>. Starting with all 42,000 journals in QOAM, the idea is to
      indicate the journals in the list which are deemed non-predatory, either because
      they are no-fee journals or because they are approved by library professionals.
      Examples of the second category are journals in <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">DOAJ</a> and <a href=\"https://journalcheckertool.org/transformative-agreements\"
      target=\"_blank\">journals included in institutional deals</a>. </p><p>However,
      this still leaves thousands of journals unaddressed. Bona Fide Journals will
      enable institutional libraries to express their trust in these journals. The
      expectation is that most libraries are familiar with a number of niche journals
      from institutions, societies or charities in their own discipline, region, or
      language.</p><p>The only thing libraries have to ascertain is that a journal
      is not mala fide. In case of doubt, the <a href=\"https://app.lib.uliege.be/compass-to-publish/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Compass to Publish</a> may offer practical guidance. If a
      journal has gained expressions of trust from three different libraries, it will
      be included in the list of trustworthy journals. Thus, libraries may resume
      their role as quality guardians of the academic publishing domain.  </p><p>Next
      to DOAJ, other sources may be included in the second diamond of the flowchart
      (see Figure 1), such as high-profile indexing services or recognized platforms
      like <a href=\"https://www.redalyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Redalyc</a>, <a
      href=\"https://scielo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SciELO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openedition.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenEdition</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ajol.info/\" target=\"_blank\">African
      Journals Online</a>. <br></p><h3>What is available now?</h3><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.qoam.eu/bfj\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bona Fide Journals</a> is operational as a minimal viable
      product, soliciting user comments to guide further development. Potential current
      use cases are:</p><ul><li>A (spammed) researcher checking the trustworthiness
      of a journal which solicits their article.</li><li>A library suggesting a specific
      collection of trustworthy journals for a project or an institute.</li><li>An
      open access publishing service using the list of Bona Fide Journals to filter
      out predatory journals that may have infiltrated into their journal base.</li></ul><h3>What
      is next?</h3><p>Bona Fide Journals offers basic evidence of the honesty of journals,
      but journals may still differ a lot when it comes to peer review, editing, data
      transparency, speed of publication, author evaluation, or publication fee. There
      are several websites that provide useful information on these aspects, but authors
      who wish to select a journal in which to publish their article may easily get
      lost when trying to find the most relevant information. Therefore, a next step
      that we hope to take is <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/systematize-information-on-journal-policies-and-practices-a-call-to-action\"
      target=\"_blank\">to develop an infrastructure</a> that brings together the
      diversity of such services in a more systematic way. Instead of reducing the
      selection of a journal to a simplistic dichotomy (mainstream vs. unfamiliar)
      or a questionable one-dimensional ranking (journal impact factor), such an infrastructure
      offers researchers an informative variety of publishing options and enables
      the scientific community to optimally benefit from these options.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Leo

      \                                               <p>One of the many puzzles of
      the COVID-19 pandemic has been <a href=\"https://bmjpaedsopen.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000722\"
      target=\"_blank\">the extent to which children are vulnerable to and spreaders
      of the virus.</a>\r\nFewer infection rates <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa691/5943164\"

      target=\"_blank\">as have milder symptoms</a>. But the infection rate in children
      is biased, given the testing policies in many countries. Schools received distinct
      attention early on in the pandemic \u2013 closing schools was among the first
      measures taken worldwide to reduce the spread of the virus. By March 31, 2020,
      schools in 193 countries were closed. Likewise, reopening schools has been part
      of the first steps in the easing of lockdown restrictions. With no definite
      scientific consensus regarding children\u2019s role in the transmission of the
      virus, decisions on the reopening of schools could not be deferred.</p><p>Given
      the uncertainty, we were curious about how scientific information was used in
      the public debates around the closing and opening of schools. In a <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4428863#.YBhEbehKiUk\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent case study</a>, we looked at Spain, South Africa, and
      the Netherlands, each of which introduced different measures. (At the time of
      the writing of our study in early December 2020, the school closings in winter
      2020/2021 still had to happen.) </p><p>Our point of departure was the <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19\"
      target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov\"
      target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature
      on coronavirus disease database</a> as of October 15, 2020. In this set, we
      identified 5,713 publications that were related to the key-terms \u2018children\u2019
      and \u2018schools\u2019. In data provided by <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Altmetric.com</a>, we found news media items and tweets from
      the three countries that included a mention of any of these publications (Table

      covered in both news and on Twitter with the policy responses in the three countries.
      The patterns of the measures taken differed. In the Netherlands, after an initial
      lockdown, schools reopened in May 2020, at quite an early stage of the first
      wave of the outbreak. In South Africa, the outbreak took place in March and
      schools reopened early in June, just to close again a month later due to the
      rise of infections, and reopen again in August. In Spain, schools did not open
      until after the summer holidays. </p><h3>Spain</h3><p>Figure 1 depicts the announced
      and implemented measures in Spain as well as the distribution of the news items
      and tweets originating from Spain. There is a small peak of tweets around the
      time of the announcements in March, and shortly before and after the schools\u2019
      reopening in September. Further activity was registered during the schools\u2019
      closure, with peaks around the end of April, when the government announced a
      plan for easing lockdown restrictions, and also in July and August, when no
      announcements were made.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Timelines_ES-v3.1.png\"

      1. Timeline of announcements and implementation of school closure and reopening
      in Spain, along with the distribution of tweets (on the left y-axis) and news
      items (on the right y-axis) mentioning scientific articles.</p><p>The highest
      number of tweets in early July revolves around a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31483-5/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">nationwide, population-based seroepidemiological study</a>\r\non
      the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. A total of 1,906 tweets followed soon
      after the article was published in the <em>Lancet</em>. The second-highest tweeted
      article (739 tweets) reports on the <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(20)31023-4/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">paediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome</a>\r\nand received
      distinct attention before the school reopening, as well as again in September.
      Similarly, attention was paid before the school reopening to the safety of reopening
      (primary) schools (see <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2024920\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02403-4\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p>There are almost no news mentions in March,
      with sustained but low activity between April and July, and recurrent peaks
      on specific days at the beginning of May, June, and July. This is followed by
      more constant activity in the media at the end of August, prior to the reopening
      of schools. The single-most mentioned article (20 news mentions) received most
      attention in April. <a href=\"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/21/E566\" target=\"_blank\">It
      presents findings on the potential impact of the summer season on slowing the
      pandemic</a><u>,</u>\r\nweighed against an alternative hypothesis that school
      closures account for such slowing. The two next most mentioned papers have 17
      mentions each. <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31483-5/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">One of them</a> discusses the results of a nationwide screening
      undertaken in Spain between April and May and concludes that at the time of
      the survey, there was a seroprevalence of around 5% with lower figures for children
      (&lt;3.1%) and a third of the positive cases being asymptomatic. <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(20)31023-4/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">The other one</a> focuses on children tested positive. </p><h3>South
      Africa</h3><p>In South Africa, there was a notable difference in the reopening
      of secondary (high) schools and primary schools in July and August (see Figure
      2) \u2013 primary schools reopened later than secondary schools. Of the 74 news
      articles originating from South Africa, 33 were published during the first school
      closure and only 18 in September. The most mentioned studies in the news are
      again the one on <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(20)31023-4/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">paediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome</a>, and one
      on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8\" target=\"_blank\">large-scale
      anti-contagion policies</a>. Regarding Twitter, we observe activity around the
      announcement of school closure in March, and immediately after the first confirmed
      death, which registers the highest Twitter activity. The highest number of tweets
      (92 tweets) was sent for a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\"
      target=\"_blank\">study concerned with the wearing of face masks</a>. The second
      peak of Twitter activity registered in May around the announcement of a phased
      reopening of schools reveals discussions gravitating around the Kawasaki-like
      disease and transmission of the virus by children. Similarly, the discussions
      from the end of June and beginning of July coincide with the first <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30177-2/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">Europe-wide study of children</a> which suggests mild disease

      target=\"_blank\">seroepidemiological study from Spain</a> (39 tweets).</p><figure><img

      2. Timeline of announcements and implementation of school closure and reopening
      in South Africa, along with the distribution of tweets and news items mentioning
      scientific articles.</p><h3>The Netherlands</h3><p>Like Spain and South Africa,
      the government in the Netherlands decided to close schools in the middle of
      March. Primary schools were reopened first, at half capacity, whereas secondary
      schools reopened three weeks later, also at half capacity. The partial opening
      was short (until June 8 and 15, respectively), after which they were fully open.
      The second school closure coincided with the summer holidays in the Netherlands
      (see Figure 3.)</p><p>Most news media attention occurred in the period during
      the school closure and the partial reopening in April and May. Fewer mentions
      were observed during the summer months, and only 21 were found in September.
      One <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>
      with a relatively high number of mentions to a scientific article (13 news items)
      reports on the protection through face masks. This is remarkable, as wearing
      face masks in indoor public spaces was not mandatory until December 2020. In
      the case of Spain and South Africa, mask wearing was made mandatory earlier,
      but the news covered this study with only two and one mention, respectively.
      </p><p>Like South Africa, the Netherlands registers relatively modest Twitter
      activity. The first sustained discussion on Twitter was stirred up by the announcement
      on March 12th that schools would remain open. The tweets debated the official
      stance that children are less susceptible to become infected. The highest tweeting
      activity (96 tweets) was generated by the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\"
      target=\"_blank\">study</a> reporting on the efficacy of face masks. The second-most
      tweeted <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(20)31023-4/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">article</a> (79 tweets) mentioned paediatric SARS-CoV-2, while
      the third-most tweeted one (71 tweets) is a news piece in Nature, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8\"
      target=\"_blank\">discussing scientific support for the wearing of face masks</a>.
      In mid-May, a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32656368/\" target=\"_blank\">systematic
      review</a> of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to indoor activities
      caught the attention of Dutch tweeters. The discussion revolved around the need
      for outdoor sports (for children).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Timelines_NL-v3.1.png\"
      data-image=\"18304\"></figure><p class=\"caption\" style=\"margin-top:12px;\">Figure
      3. Timeline of announcements and implementation of school closure and reopening
      in the Netherlands, along with the distribution of tweets and news items mentioning
      scientific articles.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Our findings suggest national
      differences regarding the research that was prominently discussed in the news
      and on social media. This suggests diverging priorities in the public discussion,
      even during a pandemic, and underlines the importance of considering national
      contexts when analysing the communication of science.</p><p>We also identified
      a disconnection between the timelines of measures and the intensity of communication
      of science in the channels observed. The reaction to policy moments was not
      necessarily accompanied by interest in related scientific output. Attention
      on Twitter \u2013 except for some weak evidence from the Netherlands \u2013
      was in most cases triggered by the publication of a scientific article, and
      not a policy event. It is conceivable that this mirrors the interests of the
      tweeting population \u2013 such as researchers or health professionals. </p><p>This
      might also be a reason for the moderate activity on Twitter, with, for example,
      no particular social movements advocating for a certain position and using scientific
      information accordingly (as can be observed in the case of the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/3557217#.YCJMT2hKiUk\"
      target=\"_blank\">anti-vaccination movement</a>). Also, no highly active Twitter
      accounts could be found. There were only two accounts (both from Spain) which
      tweeted more than 100 times during the eight-month period observed (one of them
      belonging to a paediatrician, the other one to the Spanish Society for Paediatric
      Infectious Diseases). It seems that Twitter was not (mis-)used as a communication
      platform to amplify ideologically driven messaging, at least in this context.
      In the case of the news media analysed, we identified several cases of miscommunication
      of scientific information, which illustrate that the intricacies of scientific
      studies are not always accurately communicated in the media. </p><p>In conclusion,
      these findings point to the need for further research into the communication

      science </strong></h3><p>Achieving scientific success depends on several factors:
      inspiration, creativity, hard work, access to the most advance instruments,
      et cetera. In the scholarly literature, excellent output of scientists has been
      described as a resultant of several factors with complex and often unpredictable
      interactions between personal characteristics such as education, personality,
      motivation, ambition with a mix of environmental factors [see <sup><a href=\"https://www.molnut.uni-kiel.de/pdfs/neues/2017/Max_Weber.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674224575&content=reviews\"
      target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1986.4.3.359\"

      target=\"_blank\">4</a></sup> ].</p><p>But chance is also one of these determinants.
      Only a small minority of \u2018lucky\u2019 scientists discover something really
      new and worthwhile, with exciting insights and prospects for their fellow researchers
      to further unravel. An even smaller number of researchers produce \u2018once
      in a lifetime\u2019 scientific breakthroughs that generate major impacts on
      contemporary science, societies and economies. Think \u2018Albert Einstein\u2019
      or, perhaps more appropriate at these special times, the developers of the radically
      new production platforms for Covid-19 vaccines. </p><p>Science celebrates its
      top scientists. And funders will keep supporting such excellence, as long as
      the general public, politicians and governments are convinced that scientific
      research is also a worthwhile effort for all of us. But during the last two
      decades stakeholders have become increasingly concerned and pose some fundamental
      questions: is science doing enough to tackle and solve the numerous societal,
      environmental and economic problems that affect mankind? Think for example about
      global climate change, human and animal health and welfare, poverty reduction,
      emigration\u2026 and again the Covid-19 pandemic. Pressure seems to be mounting
      to provide scientific results, especially of academic research, more useful
      for societal applications and the economy. </p><h3><strong>Research commercialisation
      and knowledge transfer</strong></h3><p>The Netherlands has been one of many
      countries in the European Union to <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674068988\"
      target=\"_blank\">adopt policies to move universities out of their \u2018Ivory
      Towers\u2019 and commercialise scientific research results faster and more effective</a>.
      In 2004 research commercialisation officially became the third mission of universities
      in the Netherlands (along with education and scientific research). In the year
      2000 the Dutch government also implemented three funding instruments (<a href=\"https://www.biopartnerleiden.nl/\"
      target=\"_blank\">BioPartner</a>, <a href=\"https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/blg-259740.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">TechnoPartner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/innovatief-ondernemen/valorisatie/valorisatieprogramma\"
      target=\"_blank\">Programma Valorisatie</a>) to also optimise \u2018technology
      transfer\u2019 between universities and industry.  Gradually, since the 1980s,
      most universities in the Netherlands have established specialised units \u2013
      either within the organisation or decentralised \u2013 for knowledge transfer
      and research commercialisation. Here, we will refer to these organisational
      units as \u2018Knowledge and Transfer Offices\u2019 (KTOs). The organisational
      set-up and goals of these units vary across universities.</p><p>These policy
      shifts had a major impact on the scientific work force. During the last two
      decades individual researchers and engineers in the Netherlands have increasingly
      been stimulated by government policies and other incentives to develop scientific
      and technological breakthroughs that can contribute to solve societal problems
      or create economic benefits [see&nbsp;<sup><a href=\"https://www.knaw.nl/en/news/publications/maatschappelijke-impact-in-kaart\"
      target=\"_blank\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/sites/default/files/2018-05/BAP_Maatschappelijke%20impact_7dec2016.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.leru.org/publications/productive-interactions-societal-impact-of-academic-research-in-the-knowledge-society\"
      target=\"_blank\">9</a>]. </sup>One of the prime incentives is the Stevin prize,
      issued annually since 2018 by the Netherlands Council for Scientific Research
      (NWO). The award, a whopping 2.5 million euro, should be spent on research or
      other activities aimed at knowledge utilisation. The Stevin prize has been awarded
      to 32 scientists since 1998. Knowledge exploitation and utilisation, including
      venturing spin-off companies, is a criterion for Stevin prize nominees since
      2001. Recently, <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/en/knowledge-ecosystems/excellence-extra-ordinary\"
      target=\"_blank\">concerns have been raised in the Netherlands</a> that striving
      for research excellence may actually reduce the capacity of researchers to engage
      with societal issues.</p><h3><strong>Survey and respondents</strong></h3><p>Our
      survey aimed to gather information from these award-winning scientists on the
      relationships between excellent science, research commercialisation and knowledge
      utilisation (none of the respondents was informed that we had invited them due
      to their status as top scientist). We were particularly interested in their
      motives to engage in utilisation, and their views on how their research achievements
      were able to create such an external impact. This survey builds on <a href=\"https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/the-relationships-between-university-ip-regimes-scientists-motiva\"
      target=\"_blank\">our earlier study</a> that also dealt with motivational factors
      underpinning research commercialisation activities but framed in the context
      of intellectual property regimes.</p><p>We applied a mixed-methods approach
      with a questionnaire and a series of follow-up interviews. The questionnaire
      collected information on the disciplinary background of the respondents, their
      main motivation to conduct research, and information on how they used results
      of their research efforts to create societal impacts. Follow-up interviews were
      conducted with a subsample of the respondents. Information gathering took place
      between September 2019 and March 2020. </p><p>The questionnaire was not only
      sent to all 32 Stevin prize winners but also to those who were awarded the Spinoza
      prize (the Dutch equivalent of the Nobel Prize), currently worth 2.5 million
      euros. Between 1995 and 2020 the Spinoza prize has been awarded to 99 scientists
      for excellent and breakthrough scientific research in their discipline. Our
      study involved a subgroup of 25 who agreed to participate; 17 Spinoza laureates
      and 8 Stevin laureates. These Spinoza prize winners worked in natural science
      (29%), engineering sciences (29%), life and medical sciences (24%), or social
      and human sciences (18%). Most of those who won a Stevin prize work(ed) in engineering
      sciences (75%); the remainder in the life and medical sciences (12%) or social
      and human sciences (12%).</p><h3><strong>Motives for doing research</strong></h3><p><strong>Figure
      1a</strong> shows the percentage of Spinoza laureate respondents who are mainly
      motivated to do \u2018basic research\u2019 (i.e. \u2018discovery oriented\u2019
      research without any intention to seek immediate applications) as opposed to
      those who are also driven by the wish to apply their research results and perhaps
      commercialize it. Next to their scientific motivations, the majority of Spinoza
      respondents fully agree that \u2018to obtain scientific insight on topics in
      their discipline\u2019 is the most important personal motivation to do research,
      followed by \u2018looking for applications of my research results\u2019 and
      \u2018recognition for my scientific achievements\u2019. The vast majority of
      Spinoza prize respondents (82%) are of the opinion that research commercialisation
      policies should not be the guiding principle for scientists in general. Interestingly,
      94% of these Spinoza laureates has nonetheless been actively engaged with some
      degree of research commercialisation. A fair share of them have been involved
      in creating spin-off companies, patent licensing, clinical trials, or dissemination
      of research data via websites or personal twitter accounts (together 33%). Others
      have been involved in business consultancy for companies (19%), training (16%),
      presentation for a general public (16%), or joint research or contract research
      with companies (13%). Almost half of all these respondents (47%) used the services
      offered by the KTO at their university or university medical centre.</p><div

      class=\"caption\" align=\"center\">Figure 1. Main motivation for basic research
      (% of respondent answers)</p><p>The Stevin prize winners present a markedly
      different profile. As <strong>figure 1b</strong> shows, none of them are motivated
      to conduct basic research without some notion of immediate applications in mind.
      However, 62% still acknowledge that \u2018to obtain scientific insight on topics
      in their discipline\u2019 is the most important personal motive to do research,
      followed by \u2018looking for applications of my research results\u2019 and
      \u2018recognition for my scientific achievements\u2019. More than a third of
      these respondents (38%) indicate that \u2018research commercialisation policies
      should be the guiding principle for scientists in their research, 25% found
      that \u2018research commercialisation policies should at least partially guide
      scientists in their research\u2019. The majority of all Stevin respondents (88%)
      has been actively engaged in several pathways to commercialise research findings
      - mostly through joint research or contract research with industry (35%) and/or
      business consultancy (20%). All of the Stevin respondents acknowledged their
      use of KTO services.</p><h3><strong>Knowledge utilisation and impact profiles</strong></h3><p>The
      scientific results of Spinoza prize winners were disseminated and utilised through
      a wide range of channels: published research papers (25%), through work of PhD
      students (22%), but also as contributions to public private partnerships with
      industry (14%), education (10%), scientific books (10%), patents (8%), or patient
      care (5%). Stevin prize laureates show a fairly similar distribution: published
      research papers (19%), PhD students (16%), public private partnerships with
      industry (16%), for education (12%), patents (12%), spin-off companies (9%),
      scientific books (6%), other innovations in education and research (6%), or
      patient care (3%). </p><p>Both groups show slightly different impact profiles.
      Queried about the channels in which their research really made a significant
      external impact, the category \u2018new technologies\u2019 is by far the most
      important channel of utilisation within the group of Spinoza prize winners (<strong>figure
      2a</strong>). As confirmed by the data in last paragraph, KTOs play a key role
      in this channel featuring very prominently among the Stevin prize laureates
      (<strong>figure 2b</strong>).But, interestingly, both the Spinoza and Stevin
      laureates mention several other non-KTO channels, such as research publications,
      PhD students, and data dissemination.</p><div style=\"float:left; width:48%;

      study captures experiences and personal views of 25 prize-winning scientists
      in the Netherlands. The information from our survey indicates that their personal
      motives and drive to conduct breakthrough science (summarised here as their
      \u2018X factor\u2019) can be an important factor for researchers to engage with
      research commercialisation and knowledge utilisation \u2013 in some cases perhaps
      even more relevant than government policies or institutional facilities such
      as university KTOs. Obviously, more information has to be collected, across
      a larger group of top scientists, before robust conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless,
      our first findings suggest that if current policies and incentives were to be
      reviewed, it could be beneficial to incorporate views of prize-winning scientists
      with a track record in research commercialisation and knowledge transfer. Their
      input to our survey highlights that more personalised approaches may offer supplementary
      incentives, in addition to KTO services and other institutionalised pathways
      in the Netherlands, to excel in the societal or economic utilisation of research.

      is the 2nd in a series of blog posts on research evaluation in the Netherlands.

      goals and the criteria and aspects that need to be addressed in an evaluation.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3><strong>A
      joint protocol\u2026</strong></h3><p>Ever since 2003, the Association of Universities
      in the Netherlands (VSNU), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research
      (NWO) and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) share the
      responsibility for the evaluation of all academic research units. They ensure
      that there is an evaluation protocol that is regularly updated. And they ensure
      that all academic research is evaluated once every six years, the duration of
      a protocol. </p><p>VSNU represents 14 large, research-intensive universities.
      Four smaller publicly funded universities use the SEP as well. NWO and KNAW
      both govern a number of academic research institutes. The universities of applied
      sciences have a different protocol, yet the system is more or less similar.</p><p>The
      current <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Strategy Evaluation Protocol 2021-2027</a> (SEP 2021-2027)
      is the fourth since the introduction of the joint protocols in 2003. The text
      of this protocol is a major source for this post.</p><h3><strong>\u2026 for
      the formative evaluation\u2026</strong></h3><p>An evaluation addresses both
      past developments, strategies and achievements, as well as future plans. The
      latter aspect is rather crucial. The idea is that the evaluation contributes
      to maintaining and, when necessary, improving the quality and relevance of the
      research. </p><p>The current protocol presents the evaluation as integral part
      of an ongoing quality assurance cycle. Evaluation should facilitate the continuous
      dialogue between the unit and the board. The evaluation committee is asked to
      reflect on positive issues and \u2013 constructively \u2013 on weaknesses, and
      to suggest where and how improvements are envisaged. These recommendations serve
      as input in the quality assurance cycle.</p><h3><strong>\u2026 of academic research
      units\u2026.</strong></h3><p>The evaluation takes place on the level of a research
      unit. The protocol characterizes a unit as an entity that is known in its own
      right, within and outside of the institution, and that is sufficiently large.
      The SEP indicates at least ten research FTEs among its permanent academic staff.
      \ </p><p>An evaluation shouldn\u2019t relate to a random collection of researchers
      that happen to work on the same floor, but to a clearly identifiable entity.
      Moreover, the evaluation does not relate to a collection of research outputs,
      but to the strategy of the unit. </p><h3><strong>\u2026 in light of their own
      context, aims and strategy.</strong></h3><p>One major change, compared to the
      previous protocol, is its name. Until 2021, the protocol was named <em>Standard
      Evaluation Protocol</em>. Since 2021, it is the <em>Strategy Evaluation Protocol</em>.
      The protocol stresses, even more so than before, that the goal is to evaluate
      a research unit in light of its own aims and strategy. An evaluation is not
      so much focused on the research itself, as it is on the strategy of the unit
      with regards to research. </p><p>The context in which a unit operates should
      be taken into account as well. The influence of the organization, with its policies
      and strategies, and the discipline, with its practices and quality standards,
      shouldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>In order to take these specific aspects into
      account, the protocol leaves room for plurality with respect to the application
      and interpretation of the different elements. </p><h3><strong>The evaluation
      criteria are research quality, </strong></h3><p>Research quality is one of three
      evaluation criteria. Central is the contribution to the body of academic knowledge,
      the quality and scientific relevance of the research and the academic reputation
      and leadership within the field. Research quality is not further specified.
      The protocol invites the unit to propose indicators for research quality that
      fit the context and strategy of the unit and to explain what the indicators
      actually indicate. The protocol doesn\u2019t provide benchmarks, nor does it
      prescribe to use benchmarks. The protocol doesn\u2019t provide lists of indicators
      either. In other words: how research quality is operationalized, is partly up
      to the unit itself.</p><h3><strong>\u2026 societal relevance,</strong></h3><p>Societal
      relevance is another of three evaluation criteria. The protocol suggests how
      <em>societal</em>\r\ncan be understood: economic, social, cultural, educational
      or any other terms that may be relevant. It also suggests an interpretation
      of relevance: impact, public engagement and uptake. Again, the protocol invites
      units to choose indicators, including case studies, that suit the nature, context
      and strategy of the unit.</p><h3><strong>\u2026 and viability\u2026</strong></h3><p>The
      final criterion is viability of the unit. Here the focus shifts from a retrospective
      view towards a forward-looking view. The unit is asked to provide information
      on future goals, plans and strategy. Viability relates to the extent to which
      the unit\u2019s future goals are relevant and to whether its strategy fits these
      goals. </p><h3><strong>\u2026 plus, four additional aspects.</strong></h3><p>Over
      the years, specific and diverse elements have been introduced to the protocol.
      They are now characterized as aspects that need to be addressed during the evaluation.
      They are 1) Open Science, 2) PhD Policy and Training, 3) Academic Culture and
      4) Human Resources Policy. </p><p>For Open Science, the protocol explains that
      this relates to the involvement of stakeholders in research, FAIR data practices,
      Open Access publishing, etc. It also refers to the Dutch National Programme
      on Open Science, especially for the definition of Open Science and Open Science
      practices. This was done because the definition of Open Science is still developing,
      the protocol has been written in 2019 and early 2020, and will be used until
      2027. By then, Open Science will most certainly have a different connotation
      than in the late 2010\u2019s.</p><p>PhD policy and training covers the supervision
      and instruction of PhD candidates. Here the context of the Netherlands is important.
      In the vast majority of cases, PhD candidates are not registered as students.
      Usually, PhD candidates are employed by the university as (temporary) scientific
      staff, with the task to do research. There is also a substantive amount of external
      PhD candidates. These are employed elsewhere and do their PhD research supervised
      by scientific staff of the unit. The implication is that PhD policy and training
      is not being assessed in a regular teaching assessment. </p><p>Academic culture
      is defined as openness, (social) safety and inclusivity of the research environment.
      \ It includes multiplicity of perspectives and identities. Academic culture
      also covers research integrity and ethics.</p><p>The final aspect, one that
      partly relates to the previous, is Human Resources Policy. This includes diversity
      of staff in terms of gender; age; ethnic and cultural background; disciplinary
      background. It also covers talent management. There is a strong link with current
      developments in Dutch academia regarding recognition and rewards of academic
      staff. More on that in a future blog post.</p><p>But first: the evaluation procedure
      and the role and responsibilities of the board, unit and committee. That is
      the subject of the next blog post.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Leonie

      \                                               <p>Any conversation about research
      evaluation in the Netherlands has the risk of developing along this line. The
      Dutch way of evaluating academic research might not be unique, but it is certainly
      not common, nor fully understood. </p><p>As a member of the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/werkgroep-sep.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">working group</a> for the monitoring and further development
      of the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">evaluation protocol</a> \u2013 and as an employee of CWTS
      \u2013 let me provide insight and context. In a series of blog posts I will
      focus on the evaluation procedure and the evaluation goals as described in the
      current protocol for the evaluation of research units. Furthermore, I will focus
      on the bigger picture and pay attention to the context in which the evaluation
      protocols have been developed and function.</p><h3><strong>A brief summary and
      outlook to upcoming blog posts</strong></h3><p>One way to summarize the core
      of the Dutch approach is \u201Cevaluation in context.\u201D The Strategy Evaluation
      Protocol 2021-2027 (SEP 2021-2027) describes the process, methods and aims for
      the evaluation of academic research units. It stresses that research units are
      evaluated in light of their own aims and strategy. It also mentions that institutional
      policies and disciplinary practices are relevant and need to be taken into account.
      Research units are thus being evaluated in context. </p><p>The larger context,
      in which the protocol has been developed and is used, should be taken into account
      as well when trying to understand research evaluation in the Netherlands. An
      evaluation of a research unit is not a stand-alone exercise; the protocol positions
      the evaluation in the context of ongoing research quality assurance in the research
      organisation. Changes in the four SEP protocols so far can be understood in
      the context of trends and developments in academia and research policy. Insight
      into the landscape and governance of public research organisations in the Netherlands
      provides context and helps to understand why there are several protocols for
      the evaluation of public research organisations. Apart from the SEP, there is
      a <a href=\"https://www.vereniginghogescholen.nl/system/knowledge_base/attachments/files/000/000/489/original/BKO_2016-2021_-_okt_2015_%2812-1-2016_definitief%29.pdf?1452598575\"
      target=\"_blank\">protocol</a>&nbsp;(in Dutch)&nbsp;for the universities of
      applied sciences; <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/sites/default/files/2018-03/Protocol%20for%20Monitoring%20and%20Evaluation%20of%20applied%20research.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">another one</a> for some non-academic public research organisations;
      and ad-hoc protocols for other public research organisations. And why we evaluate
      research units at all, should be understood in the context of the Higher Education
      and Research Act. It is the law.</p><p>In previous blog posts, colleagues introduced
      Evaluative Inquiry (<a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-i-academic-value-is-more-than-performance\"
      target=\"_blank\">I</a>, <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\"
      target=\"_blank\">II</a>, <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-iii-mixing-methods-for-evaluating-research\"
      target=\"_blank\">III</a>, and <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-iv-accountability-and-learning\"
      target=\"_blank\">IV</a>). The Evaluative Inquiry method has been put to practice
      in a number of projects, supporting research units preparing for a SEP evaluation.
      These blog posts have already provided some insight into this Dutch approach
      of contextual evaluation. One of these blogposts was named \u201CEvaluating
      research in context\u201D; very similar to the title of this series.</p><h3><strong>Evaluating
      Research in Context</strong></h3><p>The title of this series is \u201Cresearch
      evaluation in context.\u201D This is not coincidental. It is a reference to
      <a href=\"http://www.siampi.eu/Content/ERiC%20Guide%202010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Evaluating
      Research in Context (ERiC)</a>, a project that ran a decade ago in the Netherlands.
      It was a collaboration between a number of organisations, including the Association
      of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU), the Association of Universities of
      Applied Sciences (currently: Vereniging Hogescholen), the Netherlands Organisation
      for Scientific Research (NWO), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences
      (KNAW) and my previous employer, the Rathenau Instituut. </p><p>ERiC was specifically
      dedicated to the evaluation of societal relevance. The project was positioned
      in the context of evaluation protocols for academic research (the Standard Evaluation
      Protocol 2009-2015) and for research at the universities of applied sciences
      (the Brancheprotocol Kwaliteitszorg 2009-2015). Along the line of these protocols,
      ERiC stressed that research should be assessed in context. The context in which
      research units operate differs from one area of research, discipline, or organisation
      to another. Another context is provided by the mission of the unit; and this
      will differ as well between units, even if they operate in the same area of
      research, discipline, or organisation. As mentioned in a <a href=\"https://www.knaw.nl/nl/actueel/publicaties/kwaliteit-verplicht/@@download/pdf_file/20001045.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">study</a>&nbsp;(in Dutch) that informed the development of
      the first Standard Evaluation Protocol 2003-2009, comparing seemingly similar
      research units is like comparing \u201Ccoal with eggs.\u201D Apples and oranges
      apparently didn\u2019t cover the difference well enough. The consequence of
      this evaluating research in context is that a standard set of indicators wouldn\u2019t
      do justice. ERiC, again in line with the protocols, advises units to choose
      indicators that provide evidence and does justice to the research unit and its
      context.</p><h3><strong>Next up: 1 protocol, 3 criteria, 4 aspects</strong></h3><p>This
      is a very brief outlook and introduction to research evaluation in context.
      The <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/research-evaluation-in-context-2-one-joint-protocol-three-criteria-and-four-aspects\"
      target=\"_blank\">next blog post</a> will introduce the current protocol for
      the evaluation of academic research units, the Strategy Evaluation Protocol
      2021-2027. It will present the evaluation criteria and describe four extra aspects
      that need to be addressed during an evaluation.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Leonie

      my last days as a project coordinator at CWTS, I&#039;m reflecting on the so-called
      institute projects we all do at CWTS. In this blog post I would like to share
      with you my experience as a project coordinator, but first and foremost give
      you an impression of the variety of projects we do.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Institute projects at CWTS
      are projects that are acquired through different funding sources, such as <a
      href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en\" target=\"_blank\">Horizon2020</a>,
      <a href=\"https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/general/page.html?name=home\" target=\"_blank\">tenders
      set out by the European Commission</a>, but also national funding, such as <a
      href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">NWO</a> in the Netherlands. Usually,
      we work on the institute projects within a consortium of multiple organisations,
      such as universities, public institutions, or sometimes companies. Projects
      generally are focused on themes such as research integrity, Responsible Research
      and Innovation (RRI), Open Science, researcher mobility, and academic careers.
      This can be either by means of quantitative research or qualitative research,
      or a combination of both. In this blog post I will give you some examples of
      several types of projects.</p><h3>Research integrity </h3><p>A project relating
      to research integrity is the <em>Standard Operating Procedures for Research
      Integrity</em>, or in short: <a href=\"https://sops4ri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">SOPs4RI</a>,
      because we like to work with acronyms. In the SOPs4RI project CWTS has conducted
      focus group interviews with researchers from several disciplines and other relevant
      stakeholders from the same areas of research who could provide information on
      Standard Operating Procedures and guidelines relating to research integrity.
      Most of the focus groups were conducted in the beginning of 2020 just before
      travelling restrictions were introduced because of COVID-19. However, some of
      the focus groups had to be held online, which was a challenge at first, and
      currently more qualitative research is taking place online.</p><h3>Responsible
      Research and Innovation (RRI)</h3><p>Projects that are currently running at
      CWTS and that relate to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) are <em>Excellence
      in science and innovation for Europe by adopting the concept of RRI</em> (<a
      href=\"https://newhorrizon.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">NewHoRRIzon</a>), <em>Scientific
      Understanding and Provision of an Enhanced and Robust Monitoring System</em>
      (<a href=\"https://super-morri.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">SUPER_MoRRI</a>) and
      <em>Constructing Healthcare Environments through RRI and Entrepreneurship Strategies</em>
      (<a href=\"https://www.cherries2020.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">CHERRIES</a>). In
      February 2021 a new RRI-related project will start which is called <em>RRI Policy
      Experimentations for Energy Transition</em>\r\n(<a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101006295\"
      target=\"_blank\">RIPEET</a>). While NewHoRRIzon is working out the conceptual
      and operational basis to integrate RRI into European and national R&I practice
      and funding on a more general level, SUPER_MoRRI departs from the previous <em>Monitoring
      the Evolution and Benefits of RRI </em>(<a href=\"http://morri-project.eu/\">MoRRI</a>)
      project to develop a monitoring system for RRI. CHERRIES and RIPEET are both
      looking at RRI in different themes (healthcare and energy respectively) at the
      regional level. </p><h3>Open Science</h3><p>Open Science is an important theme
      for CWTS as well. One of the projects that were performed in the past is the
      <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy/open-science/open-science-monitor_en\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Science Monitor</a>. In this project different methods,
      such as bibliometric analyses and interviews for case studies, were combined
      to track trends in open access and collaborative and transparent research across
      countries and disciplines. </p><h3>Variety of themes</h3><p>Of course, we also
      work on projects in which different themes are combined with multiple forms
      of research. An example of such a project is <a href=\"https://www.risis2.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\">RISIS2</a> for which the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\">A-team</a> unifies organisations in a database. Furthermore,
      a RISIS Core Facility is being developed to provide an infrastructure for Science,
      Technology and Innovation studies. It will facilitate the collection of new
      data around the themes of public sector research, corporate innovation capabilities,
      R&I outputs and projects, policy learning, and academic careers.  </p><p>With
      the variety of projects CWTS is active in, it has always been very interesting
      for me to work at CWTS. The variety of themes and the different forms of research
      make every project distinct. Integrating the variety of themes and research
      methods in some of the projects can sometimes be a challenge because everyone
      has its own expertise. However, I think the expertise we have available at CWTS
      is very relevant and is even more relevant when we combine the variety of internal
      expertise we have when collaborating with external partners. Hopefully, CWTS
      keeps on enjoying working in the so-called institute projects. If you are interested
      in collaborating in a project with CWTS or in writing a research proposal together,
      feel free to reach out to us.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Josephine

      on our research, we discuss which gaps exist between the skills PhD graduates
      developed during their PhD and the skills that are required and valued in their
      current job. Which relevant skills do graduates bring to future jobs and which
      skills were underdeveloped during their PhD trajectory?</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Increasing numbers of doctoral
      graduates work outside academia. However, a PhD degree has been often regarded
      as the gateway to an academic career, which is also considered as <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/careers-not-just-jobs-for-phds-outside-the-academy/\">the
      \u2018default\u2019 career for PhD graduates</a>. In the same vein, careers
      outside academia are seen as \u2018alternative careers\u2019. Still, in many
      countries, more PhD graduates work outside academia than within academia. Therefore,
      you could argue that \u2018<a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/careers-not-just-jobs-for-phds-outside-the-academy/\">alternative
      careers\u2019 should not be called as such</a> and that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/there-is-life-after-academia-1.15808\">academic
      careers should be considered the alternative career option</a> instead.</p><p>As
      seen below, academia is still often seen as the default career path for PhD
      graduates by many academics <em>and</em> by PhD candidates themselves. This
      leads to PhD candidates being insufficiently prepared for a job search outside
      academia after obtaining their doctoral degree. This issue is recognized by
      various organizations within the university sector, for example by the <a href=\"https://www.leru.org/publications/delivering-talent-careers-of-researchers-inside-and-outside-academia\">League
      of European Research U</a>niversities (LERU).</p><p>The schism between academia
      being seen as the default career for PhD graduates and the reality that many
      PhD graduates will work outside academia raises the question <em>to what extent
      PhD trajectories offer the skills that are required for jobs outside academia</em>.
      To study this, we surveyed 2,193 recently graduated PhDs from Dutch universities
      (who finished their PhD trajectories two to six years ago). The results of this
      study can be found in this <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7js84/\">pre-print</a>.</p><h3>Skill
      gaps: largest gap in management and social skills</h3><p>We asked recently graduated
      PhD candidates to which extent they developed certain skills during their PhD
      trajectories and to which extent they need these in their current jobs. From
      this, we estimated the gaps there are between the acquired skills during one\u2019s
      PhD and the skills in the current job. The figure below plots thirteen skills
      in terms of skill\u2019s development during one\u2019s doctoral education (averages
      on Y-axis) and requirements in one\u2019s current job (averages on X-axis).
      A factor analysis indicated that skills could be clustered in three categories:
      scientific skills, independence skills, and management and social skills.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure-1-Skill-gaps-adj.png\"
      alt=\"Figure 1 Skill gaps adj\"></figure><p>Looking at the Y-axis, it can be
      seen that PhD graduates developed scientific knowledge, analytical thinking,
      and writing skills to the largest extent. Least developed skills were teamwork,
      social skills, and project management skills.</p><p>The further away skills
      are located from the diagonal, the larger the skill gap becomes. A positive
      skill gap applies to skills above the diagonal, which means that those skills
      were developed to a larger extent than they are actually required in the current
      job. Below the diagonal are the skills that were developed to a smaller extent
      than they are required in the current job. The skill gap is rather small in
      scientific knowledge, analytical thinking, independence, learning ability, presentation
      skills, writing skills, and language acquisition skills. The largest skill gaps
      are found in teamwork, social skills, and project management skills. These were
      all underdeveloped compared to the skills needed in the current job.</p><h3>Skill
      gaps by sector: greatest outside academia but management and social skills also
      underdeveloped for academic jobs</h3><p>Next, we investigated whether skill
      gaps differ by sector of employment, as one may expect the different sectors
      where PhD graduates work to have different skill requirements. A similar plot
      was made for the three skill categories; this time by sector of employment:
      academia, non-academic R&D, and non-R&D. A technical explanation of the grouping
      of PhD graduates into the sectors can be found in an earlier <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164784#sec002\">paper</a>
      (the link will take you to the relevant section in the paper).</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure-2-Skill-gaps-adj.PNG\"
      alt=\"Figure 2 Skill gaps adj\"></figure><p>PhD graduates reported management
      and social skills to be particularly underdeveloped compared to the requirements
      of their current jobs. A comparison between the sectors of employment shows
      that this skill gap is larger in non-academic R&D than in academia. Still, what
      is interesting here is that the PhD trajectory also insufficiently prepared
      PhD graduates for working in academia in this respect. Therefore, (project)
      management and social skills remain insufficiently developed during PhDs.</p><p>Independence
      skills were less underdeveloped in the non-R&D sector compared to both the non-academic
      R&D sector and academia sector. Finally, the largest \u2018overdevelopment\u2019
      of skills concerned scientific skills development for PhD graduates working
      in non-R&D. This makes sense, as you would expect PhD graduates who are not
      involved in research or development in their current job to need their developed
      scientific skills less.</p><h3>What does this mean for PhD trajectories?</h3><p>Our
      findings corroborate <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2014.968540\">other
      studies</a> that show that skills such as <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0192-9\">teamwork
      and project management are vital in many jobs</a>, both inside and outside academia.
      However, such skills are not sufficiently developed during doctoral education
      in the Netherlands.</p><p>To improve employability of PhDs, PhD programs in
      the Netherlands should more explicitly highlight the multitude of skills possibly
      developed during PhDs and enable a broader career development. Another recommendation
      is to integrate a <a href=\"https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/59447\">broader
      societal focus into PhD programs</a> from the earliest stages; for example by
      organizing visits to companies working in relevant fields or by offering joint
      research projects in which PhD students work together with business and industry.</p><p>Courses
      on transferable skills, for example <a href=\"https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/cursussen\">the
      ones offered by Leiden University itself</a> or those offered at other universities,
      may also help. Current PhD candidates may also enlist the help of professional
      career counselling, such as the counselling offered by their own universities,
      or other professionals tailoring their services to PhD candidates. In the Netherlands,
      these include (but are not limited to) <a href=\"https://vansijl.com/\">Claartje

      and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/exrecareers\">Exploring Research Careers</a>.</p><p>Our
      study shows that a skill gap exists between doctoral education and the labour
      market in the Netherlands. While this gap is small for PhD graduates working
      in academia, it is more prominent for PhD graduates working outside academia.
      As this is the sector in which most PhD graduates will eventually work, there
      is a need to better align the training during PhD trajectories with the demands
      from the labour market.</p><p><sub>* The authors are not affiliated with any

      \                                               <p>With the advent of online
      publishing in the 2000s, the cost structure of scientific publishing changed
      drastically. Now, printing and distribution costs have become very low. This
      has not only lowered the entry cost of new publishers, but it also lifted the
      natural restriction on the number of papers per issue which provided a strong
      rationale for gate-keeping by legacy journals. At the same time, several repositories
      became available on the Internet with published papers and pre-prints, making
      these accessible to readers without subscription. Partly due to this, the subscription
      model is now slowly substituted by the open access model, often with author
      processing charges.   </p><p>In this turbulent context, <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6r274/\"
      target=\"_blank\">many new journals have been introduced, both by incumbent
      publishers and new entrants</a>. Some of these journals are considered predatory
      by one part of the academic community, pointing to high volumes of papers, low
      review standards and misleading soliciting. Indeed, as revenues of such journals
      rely solely on article processing charges, they may be tempted to follow a market
      logic of quantity over the professional logic of quality. Another part welcomes
      the many new open-access journals as it provides more opportunities for scholars
      in less-favored, peripheral positions as well as for new topics that are less
      readily accepted in other journals. What is more, the fast turn-around of papers
      helps the quick diffusion of results and insights, while their relatively low
      article processing charges promote inclusiveness.</p><p>In this light, labeling
      particular journals as predatory assumes a binary world of 'good' and 'bad'.
      An alternative view is to acknowledge that there is a large 'grey area' of journals
      whose practices can be questioned, if only because most journals show little
      transparency about peer reviews, editorial policies and accept/reject decisions
      anyway. To illustrate this point, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/05/13/there-is-no-black-and-white-definition-of-predatory-publishing/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Siler analyzed 11,450 journals on the Cabells Journal Blacklist</a>
      in terms of the varying degrees of predatory activity ranging from fake metrics
      and false addresses to sloppy copy-editing and poor webpages. The results show
      a clear continuum rather than a bi-modal distribution, questioning the binary
      opposition used by those who label (or some would say, stigmatize) journals
      as predatory. </p><p>A further analysis of the economics underlying article
      processing charges shows that the authors fees are closely and positively related
      to quality indicators of journals. <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qss_a_00016\"
      target=\"_blank\">An analysis by Siler and Frenken of 12,127 Open Access journals</a>
      showed that journals with status endowments (JIF, DOAJ Seal), articles written
      in English and published in wealthier regions are also relatively costlier.
      <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/9500-nature-journals-will-now-make-your-paper-free-read\"
      target=\"_blank\">The recent announcement of Nature to charge 9,500 euro for
      open access</a> is illustrative in this respect. This suggests that while open
      access journals have opened up the publishing system allowing many more papers
      to be published, the hierarchy of journals will most likely remain intact, as
      high-status journals can sustain their high rejection rates with high open access
      fees, further boosting the extreme profit margins of incumbent publishers. </p><p>In
      all, one can conclude that the logics of scientific publishing are changing
      in complex ways, with economic logics becoming stronger and the types of journals
      becoming more diverse. Binary classifications of journals in \u2018good\u2019
      and \u2018bad\u2019 may hide the heterogeneity of journal practices and complex
      author motives, and may also reinforce established hierarchies in the scientific
      community. At the same time, we should be aware of various forms of predatory
      practices, by new and incumbent publishers alike, and continue to foster a critical
      debate among us.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Koen

      week Elsevier announced that it has signed the San Francisco Declaration on
      Research Assessment (DORA) and that it is going to make the reference lists
      of articles openly available in Crossref. In this Q&amp;A, Ludo Waltman shares
      his perspective on Elsevier\u2019s decision to open its citations.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>Why
      is it important that Elsevier is going to open its citations?</h3><p>Both <a
      href=\"https://sfdora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DORA</a> and the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a> have called on publishers
      to make the reference lists of their articles openly available. In response
      to this, almost all large and medium-sized publishers have made their citations
      openly available in Crossref. Elsevier was one of the very few major publishers
      that have not yet opened their citations. With <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/advancing-responsible-research-assessment\"
      target=\"_blank\">Elsevier\u2019s decision to open its citations</a>, hundreds
      of millions of citations will become openly available, closing a large gap in
      the openly available citation data in Crossref.</p><p>Citation-based indicators
      play a prominent role in research evaluations. Responsible use of these indicators
      requires openness of the underlying citation data, so that the indicators are
      fully transparent and so that anyone can question the indicators and can even
      construct alternative ones. Elsevier\u2019s decision to open its citations therefore
      represents a significant step toward more responsible use of citation-based
      indicators in research evaluations.</p><p>Citation data is also highly valuable
      to support the discovery of scientific literature. Elsevier\u2019s decision
      to open its citations can be expected to stimulate the development of innovative
      new discovery tools. Elsevier itself will also benefit from this, since the
      articles it publishes will be easier to find and as a result will attract more
      readers.</p><h3>Why has it taken so long for Elsevier to open its citations?</h3><p>The
      most important reason seems to be that Elsevier considered open citations to
      be a threat to its Scopus business. By keeping its citations closed, Elsevier
      used its strong position as a publisher to protect its Scopus business. The
      increasing pressure on Elsevier to support initiatives focused on promoting
      responsible research assessment (e.g., DORA) and open science (e.g., I4OC) has
      led to a change in its policy. While opening citations may indeed result in
      more competition for Scopus, it may also help Elsevier to shift its focus from
      monetizing data to providing value-added services, which in the longer term
      may be expected to be commercially more attractive.</p><h3>Have all citations
      now been opened?</h3><p>In January 2021, when Elsevier\u2019s citations will
      be opened, the percentage of citations in Crossref that are open will increase
      from 60% to probably more than 90%. With Elsevier opening its citations, almost
      all large and medium-sized publishers that work with Crossref will have opened
      their citations. However, there are still a few exceptions. The largest one
      is IEEE, followed by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the University
      of Chicago Press. Hopefully these publishers will now also change their policy
      and open their citations.</p><h3>What is the significance of Elsevier\u2019s
      decision to open its citations in Crossref, given that Microsoft Academic already
      makes Elsevier citations openly available?</h3><p>By making large amounts of
      bibliographic metadata openly available, <a href=\"https://academic.microsoft.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Academic</a>\r\nprovides a great service to the
      scientific community. A platform such as <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the
      Lens</a>, which relies strongly on data from Microsoft Academic, shows the value
      of this data. However, open availability of citations and other bibliographic
      metadata in Crossref has at least two additional advantages. First, Crossref
      has made a commitment to follow the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>, which helps
      to ensure the long-term sustainability of its activities. Second, Microsoft
      Academic makes data available under an <a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ODC-BY license</a>, which requires Microsoft Academic to be
      acknowledged when the data is used. In contrast, Crossref considers the data
      it makes available to be facts and does not attach a license to it. Compared
      with data from Microsoft Academic, data from Crossref is therefore easier to
      reuse and easier to combine with data from other sources.</p><h3>How does Elsevier\u2019s
      decision to open its citations affect commercial platforms such as Web of Science,
      Scopus, and Dimensions?</h3><p>The core data provided by these commercial platforms
      will increasingly also be openly available, making it more challenging for these
      platforms to monetize their data. However, at the moment these platforms still
      provide a significant amount of data that cannot easily be obtained from an
      open data source such as Crossref. Web of Science and Scopus for instance make
      data available for journals that do not work with Crossref. They also provide
      enriched data, for instance by disambiguating authors and institutions. In the
      longer term, the business models of Web of Science and Scopus can be expected
      to shift from providing data to offering value-added services on top of the
      data. There is still a lot of room for innovation in this area.</p><p>The situation
      for Dimensions is similar, with one important difference. Dimensions combines
      Crossref data with data obtained from publishers. While the increasing open
      availability of data in Crossref may decrease the value of the data provided
      by Dimensions, it will also reduce Dimensions\u2019 dependence on publishers,
      which may make it easier for Dimensions to maintain and expand its platform.</p><h3>What
      about open abstracts?</h3><p>By opening its citations, Elsevier supports the
      <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\">Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a>. It does
      not yet support the <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/\">Initiative for Open Abstracts
      (I4OA)</a>, which was launched earlier this year and which calls on publishers
      to make abstracts openly available in Crossref. <a href=\"https://i4oa.org/#publishers\">Many
      publishers</a> have already joined I4OA, including AAAS, BMJ, Cambridge University
      Press, F1000, Frontiers, Hindawi, MDPI, Oxford University Press, PLOS, PNAS,
      Royal Society, and SAGE. Elsevier still needs to take this step. Like citation
      data, abstracts play an important role in research evaluations, for instance
      to delineate the literature on specific research topics or in specific research
      areas (e.g., the <a href=\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/12/mapping-literature-to-un-sdgs-issues.html\">sustainable
      development goals</a>). A full commitment to promoting responsible research
      assessment therefore requires not just openness of citations but also of abstracts
      and other bibliographic metadata.</p><p><em>Ludo Waltman is one of the founders

      \                                               <p>Science thrives on an open
      exchange of arguments and a plurality of perspectives. Scientific discussions
      should be open, frank and blind: only arguments should matter, not who presents
      them. Different viewpoints strengthen the scientific debate, and the inclusion
      of women and minorities in science will only contribute to this. Understanding
      the role of gender in science is crucial for improving the representation of
      women. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19723-8\" target=\"_blank\">recent
      paper</a> about the role of gender in mentorship finds that prot\xE9g\xE9s with
      female mentors show a lower citation impact than prot\xE9g\xE9s with male mentors.
      This paper, which we refer to as the mentorship paper in this blog post, has
      been received quite critically. There have even been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pollyp1/status/1329455882481131524\"
      target=\"_blank\">calls to retract the paper</a>, which in turn have been criticised

      concerns, for example about the <a href=\"https://danieleweeks.github.io/Mentorship\"

      target=\"_blank\">operationalisation of the idea of mentorship</a>. In this
      blog post, we discuss a different aspect of the paper, namely the challenge
      of identifying causal effects of gender. This is a major challenge not only
      for this specific paper, but also for many other studies on the role of gender
      in science.</p><h3>Inequality, disparity and bias</h3><p>Although many papers
      use the term \u201Cgender bias\u201D, its meaning is not always clear. Instead
      of \u201Cgender bias\u201D, some studies use the term \u201Cgender disparity\u201D,
      while others employ \u201Cgender inequality\u201D, \u201Cgender difference\u201D
      or occasionally \"gender gap\". The different terms sometimes seem to be used
      interchangeably, making it unclear what researchers try to communicate with
      each term. To facilitate a clear discussion, we propose a more precise terminology.
      Such an improved terminology may contribute to a better understanding of the
      policy implications of a study. This is also relevant in the context of the
      above-mentioned mentorship paper.</p><p>We propose to define a \u201Cgender
      inequality\u201D or a \u201Cgender difference\u201D simply as any observed difference
      between people with a different gender. </p><p>Our proposal is to use the term
      \u201Cgender disparity\u201D to refer to any difference between people with
      a different gender that is <em>causally affected by their gender</em>. This
      means that if a woman had been a man (or vice-versa), the outcome of interest
      would have been different. </p><p>The strongest term is \u201Cgender bias\u201D,
      which we propose to define as any difference between people with a different
      gender that is <em>directly</em> causally affected by their gender. Similar
      to a gender disparity, this means that if a woman had been a man, the outcome
      of interest would have been different. However, whereas a gender disparity may
      be the result of an indirect causal pathway from someone\u2019s gender to a
      particular outcome, a gender bias is a <em>direct</em> causal effect.</p><figure

      data-image=\"16964\"><figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> Example causal model. Gender
      causally affects the study programme, which causally affects acceptance. There
      is a gender bias in study choice, and a gender disparity in acceptance. If there
      is a direct causal effect of gender on acceptance (represented by the dashed
      line) there is a gender bias in acceptance.</figcaption></figure><p>To clarify
      the distinction between a gender disparity and a gender bias, consider the example
      of being accepted at a prestigious university. Suppose that the acceptance rates
      for men and women are equal for each study programme, but that some study programmes
      have lower acceptance rates than others. If women apply more often for study
      programmes with lower acceptance rates, this results in a lower overall acceptance
      rate for women. In this case, there is a gender disparity in the overall acceptance
      rate. However, because the causal effect is mediated by study choice, this gender
      disparity should <em>not</em> be called a gender bias (see Figure 1). You may
      recognise this as an example of the famous Simpson\u2019s Paradox, which actually
      took place in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.187.4175.398\" target=\"_blank\">Berkeley
      in 1973</a>. In contrast, suppose that a change in someone\u2019s gender on
      an application form affects the acceptance decision. In that case, gender does
      have a direct effect on acceptance, which means there is a gender bias in acceptance
      rates.</p><p>The distinction between gender inequalities, gender disparities
      and gender biases is important in discussions about interventions that aim to
      improve participation of women in science. In the case of a gender disparity
      or gender bias, there is a causal effect of gender on a particular outcome.
      This provides a clear rationale for considering to intervene somewhere in the
      system. The distinction between gender disparities and gender biases helps to
      determine where in the system an intervention seems more appropriate. To illustrate
      this, let us revisit the above example of being accepted at a prestigious university.
      If the effect of gender on acceptance rates is mediated by study choice, there
      is a gender bias in the choice of study programme, not in acceptance rates.
      Therefore, an intervention targeted at study choice (e.g., making certain study
      programmes more attractive for women) seems more reasonable than an intervention
      targeted directly at acceptance rates (e.g., imposing a minimum acceptance rate
      for women). Whether an intervention is desirable can still be debated, but the
      distinction between gender disparities and gender biases helps to clarify where
      in the system an intervention might best be considered.</p><p>All gender disparities
      are also gender inequalities, but the opposite does not hold: not all gender
      inequalities are gender disparities. This complicates matters greatly in many
      studies, including the above-mentioned mentorship paper. The reason is a problem
      known as <a href=\"http://www.the100.ci/2017/03/14/that-one-weird-third-variable-problem-nobody-ever-mentions-conditioning-on-a-collider/\"
      target=\"_blank\">collider fallacy</a>.</p><figure class=\"image-full landscape\"><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure-2.jpg\" data-image=\"16978\"><figcaption><b>Figure
      2.</b> Simplified causal model of the role of gender in science. Each arrow
      represents a direct causal effect of one factor on another. For example, talent
      has a direct effect on staying in academia in this model.</figcaption></figure><h3>Collider
      fallacy</h3><p>To illustrate the problem of collider fallacy, we consider a
      simple causal model describing mechanisms relevant to interpreting the above-mentioned
      mentorship paper (see Figure 2). In our model, someone\u2019s research talent
      affects both the citations they receive and the likelihood of staying in academia.
      Independently of this, someone\u2019s gender and the gender of their mentor
      also affects the likelihood of staying in academia. More specifically, we assume
      that having a female rather than a male mentor makes it more likely for a female
      prot\xE9g\xE9 to stay in academia. In this causal model, there are multiple
      factors that affect the factor \u201Cstaying in academia\u201D, making it a
      collider for those factors.</p><p>If we condition on the factor \u201Cstaying
      in academia\u201D, for example by controlling for it in a regression model,
      we introduce a correlation between the gender of the mentor and the research
      talent of the prot\xE9g\xE9. In our causal model, female prot\xE9g\xE9s with
      male mentors are less likely to stay in academia, which means that those who
      do stay in academia can be expected to be more talented, on average, than their
      colleagues with female mentors. As a result, having female mentors is correlated
      with a lower research talent of prot\xE9g\xE9s who stay in academia. Their lower
      research talent then in turn leads to fewer citations for those prot\xE9g\xE9s.
      Importantly, however, this correlation does <em>not</em>\r\nreflect a causal
      effect. Instead, it is the result of conditioning on a collider. This example
      illustrates the problem of conditioning on colliders when studying causal effects.
      It leads to wrong conclusions.</p><p>The problem, unfortunately, is even more
      daunting. When we collect data, we often use a variable to select the data to
      be collected. This effectively means that we control for this variable. If the
      variable acts as a collider, this leads to a collider fallacy. In the mentorship
      paper, the authors make a selection of the prot\xE9g\xE9s included in the data
      collection: \u201Cwe consider prot\xE9g\xE9s who remain scientifically active
      after the completion of their mentorship period\u201D (p. 2). In our causal
      model introduced above (see Figure 2), this selection of prot\xE9g\xE9s results
      in a collider fallacy, leading to the observation that prot\xE9g\xE9s with female
      mentors receive fewer citations. Depending on the extent to which our causal
      model captures the relevant causal mechanisms, the main result of the paper
      may be due to this collider fallacy.</p><h3>From observations to recommendations</h3><p>The
      possibility of a collider fallacy calls into question the policy recommendations
      made in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19723-8\" target=\"_blank\">the
      mentorship paper</a>. The authors suggest that women should be paired with a
      male mentor because this has a positive effect on their citation impact. If
      the above causal model holds true, this suggestion is not correct. In this model,
      pairing a female prot\xE9g\xE9 with a male mentor reduces the likelihood that
      the prot\xE9g\xE9 stays in academia, which means that those prot\xE9g\xE9s who
      do persevere in academia are likely to be more talented and to receive more
      citations. In our terminology: the difference between male and female mentors
      in the citations received by their prot\xE9g\xE9s may be only a gender inequality,
      not a gender disparity and certainly not a gender bias. Without additional evidence
      or assumptions, the observed gender inequality does not support the policy recommendations
      made in the mentorship paper. In fact, given our conjectured causal model, it
      can be argued that one should do the opposite of what is suggested in the paper:
      to increase female participation in science, female prot\xE9g\xE9s should be
      paired with female mentors.</p><p>Although many eyes are now on the mentorship
      paper, the state of affairs in many other papers on gender differences in science
      is not necessarily better. In an excellent and comprehensive <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/10548\"
      target=\"_blank\">review</a>\r\nof the literature on gender differences in science
      funding, the lack of causal knowledge was identified as a sore point. The literature
      regularly discusses gender inequalities, disparities and biases without having
      a clear causal framework, possibly leading to ill-conceived policy recommendations,
      which in some cases may actually hurt progress towards a better gender balance.
      We hope that our proposed definitions of gender inequality, gender disparity
      and gender bias contribute to an improved appreciation of the causal intricacies
      in studying the role of gender in science.</p><p>As already mentioned, some
      calls have been made to retract the mentorship paper. We do not support such
      calls. The policy recommendations made in the paper may be incorrect and may
      even be harmful to the representation of women in science. However, discussions
      about the correct interpretation of analyses like the one reported in the mentorship
      paper are highly complex and usually do not lead to a clear-cut answer. Papers
      should be retracted in the case of factual mistakes or scientific misbehaviour.
      Retracting a paper because of disagreements about the interpretation of the
      findings would be deeply problematic. We should exchange arguments and discuss
      their merits in an open and honest debate. If we lose this, we are fighting
      a lost cause.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Vincent

      & OS: two co-existing sets of ambitions</h3><p>Responsible Research and Innovation
      (RRI) and Open Science (OS) are two co-existing sets of ambitions concerning
      systemic change in the research and innovation (R&I) system. Initially, RRI
      and OS may appear to align well. RRI aims to facilitate solutions to the grand
      challenges faced by society by bringing together a range of societal actors
      in an interactive, transparent, and responsive process. OS emphasises the role
      of information technology in enabling collaboration across disciplines and sectors
      needed to solve grand challenges.  However, it is unclear whether RRI and OS
      are mutually supportive of the same ends. This has become a pressing issue for
      us as scholars engaged in RRI and OS projects. What does the co-existence of
      RRI and OS initiatives mean for those of us who study, offer advice on, and
      aim to be a key part of science-society dynamics?  This is a difficult question
      to address. Both RRI and OS take different forms (e.g. research topics, policy
      frameworks, visions), implying that their precise meaning and rationales differ.
      However, we assert that RRI and OS can be meaningfully compared as transformative
      change agendas for R&I. We propose looking for differences in terms of what
      motivates a transformative agenda, i.e. why do we need to open up the R&I system?
      </p><h3>Two storylines</h3><p>In order to explore this question, we offer two
      storylines that account for the specific contexts and dynamics of RRI and OS.
      RRI emerged as a policy concept in 2011 with firm roots in various traditions
      that seek to enhance the integration of science and society, e.g. Technology
      Assessment, Ethical, Legal and Societal Aspects (ELSA), and anticipatory governance.
      RRI became an important innovation policy issue for a variety of R&I actors
      for myriad reasons: the need to orient new technologies toward societal challenges;
      \ the need to prevent adverse effects; and to establish public trust and confidence
      in the governance of R&I. RRI can be seen as a movement that emphasises normative
      aspects of the R&I system. OS is gaining increasing prominence at national and
      supranational levels, as seen, for example in the three strategic research priorities
      underlying current European Union R&I policy, namely Open Innovation, Open Science,
      and Open to the World (\u2018the 3 Os\u2019). Open inquiry has long been at
      the heart of the scientific endeavour. Open Science calls for a further \u2018opening
      up\u2019 of the research process by extending the principle of openness to <em>all
      </em>aspects of the research process. OS is concerned with epistemic deficiencies
      and aims to develop new ICT platforms to ensure scientific capacity for societal
      needs. </p><h3>Comparing prescriptive actions for transformation</h3><p>At first
      glance, the transformative agendas of RRI and OS align in key areas, as seen,
      for instance in the emphasis on responsible conduct of research. RRI concerns
      opening up R&I processes to various stakeholders in transparent, open, and responsive
      dialogue about trajectories and priorities of development. OS can strengthen
      research integrity by diffusing knowledge at an earlier stage of the research
      process. Both RRI and OS have relevance for grand challenges also, although
      there are differences in emphasis. For RRI, the alignment with grand challenges
      is far more integral to its core logic and claims to relevance. OS, on the other
      hand, demonstrates relevance in its more general efforts to improve capacities
      in scientific activity.  </p><h3>Engagement with publics and stakeholders</h3><p>Differences
      in prescriptions for \u2018opening up\u2019 become especially clear when examined
      in relation to topics that are of central importance to both.  For instance,
      as regards <strong>engagement with publics and stakeholders</strong>, the emphasis
      in Open Science is on <em>doability</em>\r\nand the internal processes and structures
      of doing R&I. OS is researcher-driven, with the peer community the most important
      audience. OS is also driven by a more outward-looking focus, which can be expressed
      as an ambition to democratise research.  RRI\u2019s approach to opening up is
      broader, extending an invitation to publics to co-produce the aims and means
      of technical processes for greater alignment with public values. RRI reflects
      a view of societal voices and citizens as legitimate partners and beneficiaries
      of technology and knowledge, while one sees less of a symmetrical relationship
      between technical and experts and societal voices in OS.  Thus, we see normative
      and pragmatic motivations for RRI and OS, respectively.</p><h3>Approaches to
      interdisciplinarity</h3><p>There are also differences with respect to <strong>approaches
      to interdisciplinarity</strong> prescribed by RRI and OS. RRI emphasises explorative
      methods and the inclusion of value judgements alongside epistemic and technical
      issues. In addition, the inclusion of non-experts is underpinned by normative
      justifications. Different  Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines
      and societal stakeholders are invited into the research process for different
      reasons. Thus, there is a clearly articulated role for SSH grounded in their
      specific areas of expertise. OS, on the other hand, promotes an agenda of digital
      research infrastructure that implies a call for a fundamental transformation
      of existing R&I systems. The focus here is on pragmatic questions regarding
      the construction of functional infrastructure. The emphasis is on reducing incommensurability
      between disciplines and data sets \u2013 in this sense, SSH\u2019s critical
      capacities and explorative methodologies do not fit.  Here again, we see a distinction
      between normative and pragmatic motivations, or <em>desirability</em> and <em>doability</em>.
      </p><h3>Where to next?</h3><p>Our comparison suggests that publics will, to
      a lesser degree, be invited to reflect systematically on the structural and
      long-term implications of R&I, under an OS focused research policy regime. Future
      efforts in OS, particularly in the area of citizen science, may benefit from
      building on RRI\u2019s achievements in institutionalising participatory approaches
      to R&I, rather than abandoning them altogether. One could speculate that the
      instrumental focus of OS might allow the movement to converge more easily with
      political and institutional goals to attract investment and sustain its momentum
      as a policy tool than has been the case for RRI.  But the question is: at what
      cost? What are the implications for 1) engagement (with respect to the kind
      of work SSH are being asked to do) and for 2) interdisciplinarity, i.e. for
      the terms and conditions of our participation?</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Clare

      as knowledge integration for grappling with societal challenges </h3><p>Last
      October the US National Academies held a <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/10-22-2020/a-workshop-on-the-implications-of-convergence-for-how-the-national-center-for-science-and-engineering-statistics-measures-the-science-and-engineering-workforce\"
      target=\"_blank\">workshop (available here)</a> to gather views on how to better
      measure and assess the implications of interdisciplinarity, or convergence,
      for research and innovation. The use of the term convergence as a synonym of
      interdisciplinarity followed from two previous reports by the National Academies
      (<a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18722/convergence-facilitating-transdisciplinary-integration-of-life-sciences-physical-sciences-engineering\"
      target=\"_blank\">2014</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25271/fostering-the-culture-of-convergence-in-research-proceedings-of-a\"
      target=\"_blank\">2019</a>). These reports understood <strong>convergence as
      the \u2018</strong><strong>integration</strong><strong>of knowledge and ways
      of thinking to tackle complex challenges</strong><strong>and achieve new and
      innovative solutions</strong> that could not otherwise be obtained.\u2019 (A
      discourse that echoes European discourse on interdisciplinarity for <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/societal-challenges\"
      target=\"_blank\">grand challenges</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/missions-horizon-europe_en\"
      target=\"_blank\">missions</a>.)</p><p>In this blog, I will summarise the argument
      I put forward in the workshop: that for mapping progress towards this goal (that
      is: the successful knowledge integration for addressing a given societal challenge),
      we should conduct multidimensional portfolio analyses on the types of knowledge
      to be integrated rather than produce synthetic indicators of interdisciplinarity.
      </p><p>For two main reasons. First, since knowledge integration for societal
      challenges is a systemic and dynamic process, we need broad and plural perspectives
      and therefore we should use a battery of analytical tools, as developed for
      example in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9271-8\"
      target=\"_blank\">research portfolio analysis</a>, rather than a narrow focus
      on interdisciplinarity. The second reason is that while interdisciplinarity
      is one (but not the only) of the relevant concepts in knowledge integration,
      the concept of interdisciplinarity is too ambiguous, diverse and contextual
      to be captured by traditional indicators, as discussed in a <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/on-measuring-interdisciplinarity-from-indicators-to-indicating\"
      target=\"_blank\">previous blog</a>.</p><h3>Fostering plural innovation pathways
      in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity</h3><p>It has long been argued that
      addressing societal challenges, such as climate change or COVID-19, benefits
      from the combination of disparate types of knowledge. Societal challenges are
      <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/spp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scipol/scaa027/5874664\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018wicked\u2019 problems</a>, in the sense that the framings
      of both the problems and the solutions are complex, disputed and uncertain.
      </p><p>Under these <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26268300\" target=\"_blank\">conditions
      of ambiguity and uncertainty</a>, research contributions are likely to come
      from combinations of diverse types of knowledge (or ways of knowing). This is:
      diversity <em>within</em> projects is needed. However, diversity <em>across</em>\r\nprojects
      is also necessary. Since we do not know or even agree in advance on what types
      of expertise are appropriate to tackle a given problem, it is also important
      to have a plurality of research trajectories. Take the example of malaria: in
      spite of decades of efforts to develop drugs or vaccines, the most successful
      strategies so far have been fighting mosquitoes that transmit it, in particular
      with <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/itn.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">insecticide-treated bed nets</a>.</p><p>Therefore, rather
      than just aiming at fostering a \u2018melting pot\u2019 of disciplines, research
      systems should also produce a high number of disparate research trajectories
      \u2013 knowing that only some of them will ever be technically successful. </p><p>Moreover,
      different research and innovation pathways are not equally desirable from a
      <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-011-9161-7\" target=\"_blank\">public
      value perspective</a> \u2013 directionality matters. Some solutions are more
      socially preferable than others depending on their effects on public goods such
      as equity or environmental sustainability. Which means that public investment,
      while keeping a diverse portfolio of research strategies, should favour those
      which are perceived as more socially robust and relatively underfunded by the
      private sector. </p><p>In summary, policy for S&T convergence should aim at
      fostering systemic diversity, rather than interdisciplinarity in every single
      project or program, but it should also take into account the preferred research
      directions in particular contexts or societies.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols2_2_Dec20.jpg\"

      interdisciplinarity to multi-level mapping of knowledge integration </h3><p>Measurement
      approaches to convergence should reflect this turn towards a systemic perspective
      on knowledge integration for societal challenges. </p><p>This shift in the conceptualisation
      of S&T indicators from individual to systemic properties is similar to the shift
      in biology towards ecological approaches. The <a href=\"https://movies2.nytimes.com/books/first/s/scott-state.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">forest should not be measured by the average size of its trees
      or the timber it yields (scalars)</a>, but by the distribution (vectors) of
      all types of species and how they interact (matrices). Because the wealth, in
      sustainable terms, that can be derived from the forest comes from this diversity:
      water resources, herbs and mushrooms that unexpectedly yield nutritional or
      pharmacological benefits, spaces for leisure and well-being, etcetera.</p><p>Similarly,
      the \u2018solutions\u2019 to societal challenges will not emanate from 1,000
      labs with the same combination of disciplines, but from labs of various epistemic
      combinations and social embeddings. Therefore, our measurement should not focus
      on an average degree of interdisciplinarity. Instead, it should focus on mapping
      the directions and diversity of research approaches. To do this, we need to
      shift towards statistical descriptions of the vectors and distributions of research
      trajectories over knowledge landscapes. A framing in terms of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9271-8\"
      target=\"_blank\">research portfolios</a> can help conduct this type of analyses.
      \ </p><h3>Portfolio analysis: exploring directions, diversity and synergies</h3><p>In
      a nutshell, the key idea is that for a given societal issue, the contribution
      of research should be explored by mapping the relevant types of knowledge over
      a research landscape (e.g. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2017.09.010\"
      target=\"_blank\">see obesity</a>). The portfolio or repertoire of a given laboratory,
      university or territory,  can then be visualised by projecting (overlaying)
      their activities of this research landscape, as illustrated in the figure above
      for \u2018rice research\u2019 (or <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2018.07.005\"
      target=\"_blank\">avian flu</a>). </p><p>First, this portfolio provides us with
      <strong>information on the main directions</strong> that the research on a given
      topic is taking \u2013 which is pointing to the type of solutions envisaged
      for a grand challenge. For example, in the example in the figure above on rice,
      if the focus is related to genomics, mainstream research investments can be
      expected to deliver via Genetically Modified seeds (the case of the US). But
      if the focus is in fertilizers and yields (the case of India), the main goal
      is to increase productivity.</p><p>Second, the portfolio can <strong>tell us
      about the diversity of research efforts</strong>, i.e. whether investments are
      heavily concentrated in a few areas, or distributed across a variety of fields.
      In the face of uncertainty and contested views on preferred innovation pathways
      (e.g. in renewable energies), one would expect a variety of pathways to be supported.
      This way the bets are hedged against unexpected scientific results or social
      reactions to certain approaches.  Indicators of interdisciplinarity provide
      a view of the epistemic diversity in specific projects, labs or centres. This
      is a valuable but only a partial perspective of the research landscape.</p><p>Third,
      by analysing the interrelations between innovation areas, <strong>a portfolio
      approach helps think about the synergies</strong>\r\nor lack thereof across
      research pathways. For example, in a portfolio of energy technologies, solar
      cells and small wind turbines have positive synergies as they both fit with
      distributed electricity infrastructure, while they have negative synergy with
      nuclear energy which needs centralisation. Understanding these positive or negative
      relations is important in balancing portfolios. </p><h3>From \u2018atomistic\u2019
      to systemic and dynamic descriptions</h3><p>In summary, since social contributions
      are multifaceted, the analysis of research for societal challenges needs to
      adopt systemic perspectives, and thus take multidimensional forms. Research
      portfolio analysis offers a battery of tools, among other possibilities of exploring
      systemic properties of a research landscape. While interdisciplinary research
      is paramount in certain points, it is not required across the whole landscape.
      Therefore, rather than indicators of aggregates or averages, we need rich description
      of knowledge landscapes including the directions, diversity and synergies of
      research trajectories.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ismael

      for addressing societal problems</h3><p>In this blog I will share some thoughts
      developed for and during a fantastic <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/10-22-2020/a-workshop-on-the-implications-of-convergence-for-how-the-national-center-for-science-and-engineering-statistics-measures-the-science-and-engineering-workforce\"
      target=\"_blank\">workshop (available here)</a> held last October by the US
      National Academies to help the National Science Foundation (NSF) set an agenda
      on how to better measure and assess the implications of interdisciplinarity
      (or convergence) for research and innovation. The event showed that interdisciplinarity
      is becoming more prominent in the face of increasing demands for science to
      address societal challenges. Thus, policy makers across the globe are asking
      for methods and indicators to monitor and assess interdisciplinary research:
      where it is located, how it evolves, how it supports innovation. </p><p>Yet
      the wide diversity of (sometimes divergent) presentations in the workshop supported
      the view that policy notions of interdisciplinarity are too diverse and too
      complex to be encapsulated in a few universal indicators. Therefore, I argue
      here that strategies to assess interdisciplinarity should be radically reframed
      \u2013 away from traditional statistics towards contextualised approaches. Thus,
      I suggest to follow recent publications in proposing two different, but complementary,
      shifts:</p><p><em><em>From indicators to indicating:</em></em></p><ul><li><em><em></em></em>An
      assessment of specific interdisciplinary projects or programs for <em>indicating</em>

      issue \u2013 interdisciplinarity.</li></ul><p>Both strategies reflect <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/spp/article-abstract/45/4/433/4915398\"
      target=\"_blank\">the notion of <em>directionality</em> in research and innovation</a>,
      which is gaining hold in policy. Namely, in order to value intellectual and
      social contributions of research, analyses need to go beyond quantity (scalars:
      unidimensional indicators) and to take into account the orientations of the
      research contents (vectors: indicat<em><strong>ing</strong></em>&nbsp;and distributions).</p><h3>The
      failure of universal indicators of interdisciplinarity</h3><p>In the last decade,
      there have been multiple attempts to come up with universal indicators based
      on bibliometric data. For example, in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/NSB.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>2010 Science & Engineers Indicators (p. 5-35)</em></a>
      reported a study commissioned by the NSF to <em>SRI International</em> which
      concluded that it was premature \u2018to identify one or a small set of indicators
      or measures of interdisciplinary research\u2026 in part, because of a lack of
      understanding of how current attempts to measure conform to the actual process
      and practice of interdisciplinary research\u2019.</p><p>In 2015, the UK research
      councils commissioned two independent reports to assess and compare the overall
      degree of interdisciplinarity across countries. The <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/uk-interdisciplinary-research\"
      target=\"_blank\">Elsevier report</a> produced the unforeseen result that China
      and Brazil were more interdisciplinary than the UK or the US \u2013 which I
      interpret as an artefact of unconventional (rather than interdisciplinary) citation
      patterns of \u2018emergent\u2019 countries. A <a href=\"https://www.digital-science.com/press-releases/new-digital-research-report-interdisciplinary-research-know-measuring/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Digital Science report</a>, with a more reflective and multiple
      perspective approach, was interestingly titled: \u2018<em>Interdisciplinary
      Research: Do We Know What We Are Measuring?</em>\u2019 and concluded that:<strong><br></strong></p><p><a

      and Schneider</a>, in a quantitative literature review \u2018corroborate[d]
      recent claims that the current measurements of interdisciplinarity in science
      studies are both confusing and unsatisfying\u2019 and thus \u2018question[ed]
      the validity of current measures and argue[d] that we do not need more of the
      same, but rather something different in order to be able to measure the multidimensional
      and complex construct of interdisciplinarity\u2019.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols1_Nov20_Fig1_880x600.jpg\"

      broader review on evaluations of interdisciplinarity by <a href=\"https://shiny.sesync.org/apps/evaluation-sankey/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Laursen and colleagues</a> also found a striking variety of
      approaches (and indicators) depending on the contexts, purpose and criteria
      of the assessment. They highlighted a lack of \u2018rigorous evaluative reasoning\u2019,
      i.e. insufficient clarity on how criteria behind indicators relate to the intended
      goals of interdisciplinarity. </p><p>These critiques do not mean that one should
      disregard and mistrust the many studies of interdisciplinarity that use indicators
      in sensible and useful ways. The critiques point out that the methods are not
      stable or robust enough, or that they only illuminate a particular aspect. Therefore<ins>,</ins>
      they are valuable but only for specific contexts or purposes.</p><p>In summary,
      the failed policy reports and the findings of scholarly reviews suggest that
      universal indicators of interdisciplinarity cannot be meaningfully developed
      and that, instead, we should switch to radically different analytical approaches.
      These results are rather humbling for people like myself who worked on methods
      for \u2018measuring\u2019 interdisciplinarity for many years. Yet they are consistent
      with critiques to conventional scientometrics and efforts towards <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h2fxp/\"
      target=\"_blank\">methods for \u2018opening up\u2019 evaluation</a>, as discussed,
      for example, in \u2018<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2u254&title=st-indicators-in-the-wild-contextualisation-and-participation-for-responsible-metrics\"
      target=\"_blank\">Indicators in the wild</a>\u2019. </p><h3>From indicators
      to <em>indicating </em>of interdisciplinarity</h3><p>Does it make sense, then,
      to try to assess the degree of interdisciplinarity? Yes, it may make sense as
      far as the evaluators or policy makers are specific about the purpose, the contexts
      and the particular understandings of interdisciplinarity that are meaningful
      in a given project. This means stepping out of the traditional statistical comfort
      zone and interacting with relevant stakeholders (scientists and knowledge users)
      about what type of knowledge combinations make valuable contributions \u2013acknowledging
      that actors may differ in their understandings. </p><p>Making a virtue out of
      necessity, <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/qss_a_00062?af=R&mobileUi=0\"
      target=\"_blank\">Marres and De Rijcke</a> highlight that the ambiguity and
      situated nature of interdisciplinarity allow for \u2018interesting opportunities
      to redefine, reconstruct, or reinvent the use of indicators\u2019, and propose
      a participatory, abductive, interactive approach to indicator development. In
      opening up in this way the processes of measurement, they bring about a leap
      in framing: from indicat<em><strong>ors</strong></em> (as closed outputs) to
      indicat<em><strong>ing</strong></em> (as an open process). </p><p>Marres and
      De Rijcke\u2019s proposal may not come as a surprise to project evaluators,
      who are used to choosing indicators only after <a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-018-0281-5/figures/3\"
      target=\"_blank\">situating the evaluation and choosing relevant frames and
      criteria</a> \u2013 i.e., in fact evaluators are used to indicat<em><strong>ing</strong></em>.
      But this approach means that aggregated or averaged measures are unlikely to
      be meaningful. </p><p>In an <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/knowledge-integration-for-societal-challenges-from-interdisciplinarity-to-research-portfolio-analysis\"
      target=\"_blank\">ensuing blog</a>, I will argue, however, that in order to
      reflect on knowledge integration to address societal challenges, we should shift
      from a narrow focus on interdisciplinarity towards broader explorations of research
      portfolios.<br></p><p><span class=\"caption\"><em>Header image:&nbsp;\"<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Muu-karhu/Gallery#/media/File:View_of_a_kaleidoscope.JPG\"

      Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner, a researcher at Leiden University\u2019s Centre for
      Science and Technology Studies, stumbled upon the Twitter feed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ststitlebot/\"
      target=\"_blank\">STS Title Bot</a>, he was immediately struck by its creativity
      and effortless verisimilitude. Despite being generated by an automated algorithm
      that has apparently been fed with data obtained through text mining, many titles
      could easily pass for actual publications in major STS journals. Browsing the
      recent inventions of the algorithm, one comes across such fictional publications
      as \u201CWaste in the 21st century: (re-)classifying materiality, exploration
      and experiment\u201D or \u201CWhat is a bridge? Engaged circulations for (re-)negotiating
      movements\u201D.</p><p>The disconcerting familiarity of these titles raised
      an interesting question: is there such a thing as a typical STS journal article
      whose very conventionality is a precondition for the effectiveness of the algorithm?
      Luckily, Wolfgang is working on a research project that could attempt a partial
      answer to this question, and apparently in the affirmative: a typical STS journal
      article is approximately 20 pages in length, has 50-60 references, and mostly
      cites journals indexed in Web of Science. The typical article attempts, moreover,
      to coin a new concept, one that is connected to the foundational STS literature
      but usually does not challenge this literature in a significant way, and draws
      on an in-depth, often ethnographic, case study. </p><p>These findings come out
      of a research project entitled \u201CChanging landscape of academic publishing
      and its impact on interdisciplinary social science fields: The case of science
      & technology studies (STS),\u201D funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities
      Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Led by Kean Birch, a professor at York University,
      and with Kaltenbrunner as co-PI, the team moreover includes Thed van Leeuwen,
      another researcher at Leiden University, and Maria Amuchastegui, a graduate
      student at York University. </p><p>In addition to identifying a typical journal
      article, the ongoing research project seeks to discern how such a standardized
      format has emerged, and what implications it might have for the content of the
      research published in STS journals. </p><p>The research team are using multiple
      methods, including both scientometric approaches and interviews with 76 editors,
      editorial board members, authors, referees, and publishers associated with seven
      general STS journals. The informants come from around the world, primarily Europe
      and North America, but also Asia and Latin America, and are from different career
      stages. The research team also conducted a scientometric analysis of STS journal
      articles, focusing on both metadata and content. </p><p>So far, the metadata
      analysis has revealed several trends across a wider array of STS journals. First,
      it documents the growing importance of the Web of Science for scholarly communication
      in STS. The sheer volume of journal articles published has significantly increased
      in the last three decades, with two particularly pronounced upticks in the late
      1990s and another in the late 2000s. Moreover, articles in the 1990s cited a
      significant diversity of types of publications, from monographs to edited volumes
      to articles in non-indexed journals. As of 2015, however, STS journal articles
      in the Web of Science predominantly refer to other articles of the same type,
      thus emphasizing the growing importance of the Web of Science for scholarly
      communication in STS. </p><p>Interestingly, the metadata analysis also shows
      that the article format gradually standardized. In the 1980s, there was much
      variance in page length and number of citations. Many journal issues contain
      shorter conceptual essays, position papers, and conference reports alongside
      very long empirical research articles of 60-70 pages, sometimes even split into
      multiple parts. Starting in the late 1990s, however, the amount of variance
      decreased, and a standard format with the previously mentioned characteristics
      began to emerge, converging at around 20 pages and 50-60 references. </p><p>A
      preliminary analysis of the interview transcripts gives additional hints at
      the epistemic shifts that have accompanied formal standardization. For example,
      in the 1980s and early 1990s, in line with the zeitgeist of postmodern literary
      theory, emphatically ironic writing, use of polyphonic narration, and other
      forms of experimentation with format were common. Nowadays, authors aim for
      more standard prose, a stylistic shift that may reflect the imperative to be
      cited. Several interview subjects noted, moreover, that nowadays there seem
      to be fewer \u201Cbig ideas\u201D. </p><p>What prompted these changes in STS
      publishing? One hypothesis is that the standardization of the journal article
      should be seen as the emergent result of a confluence of broader dynamics. On
      one hand, publishing companies trying to streamline the production of journal
      articles to lower marginal cost; and on the other, attempts by scholars to approach
      their research practice as an epistemic economy of scale, geared to manage various
      constraints and uncertainties in the daily conduct or research \u2013 for example
      related to funding, evaluation, collaboration, and the differentiation and growth
      of STS as a field.</p><p>What are the next steps in the project? The team is
      currently undertaking a fine-grained content analysis of the general STS journals
      covering 30 years of STS publishing (1990-2019). The following seven journals
      were included in the content dataset: <em>Social Studies of Science</em>; <em>Science,
      Technology and Human Values</em>; <em>Science as Culture</em>; <em>Science and
      Technology Studies</em>; <em>Social Epistemology</em>; <em>East Asian Science
      and Technology Studies</em>; and <em>Engaging STS</em>. To create the dataset,
      Maria Amuchastegui has written a custom Python script to scrape the contents
      from the PDFs and identify new epistemic concepts that have emerged in the STS
      literature. Combined with the material already collected, this will hopefully
      allow for a detailed understanding of the co-evolution of epistemic debates
      in a scholarly community and the publishing practices it simultaneously cultivates.</p>\n\n

      \                                               <p>In this blog post we discuss
      <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/60586\" target=\"_blank\">recent
      findings on the relation between career trajectories and task specialization</a>.
      Research careers are commonly envisioned in evaluation schemes as homogeneous
      pathways in which individuals have to take a series of steps to advance. In
      each of these steps, researchers must comply with certain expectations, usually
      so embedded into our way of thinking of scientists that many countries and supranational
      agencies even explicitly address what is expected of individuals at each stage.
      The rationale behind this is to ensure that career paths align with academic
      positions, and describe the whole process <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-007-9063-7\"
      target=\"_blank\">from apprentice to colleague</a>. </p><p>Examples of such
      simplified vision of research careers can be found for instance in the Research
      Profiles defined by the European Commission (Figure 1), in which four stages
      are defined along with the expectations and requirements needed to reach each
      of them. In the description of such profiles words such as <em>excellence </em>and
      <em>leadership </em>are common, in many cases even used as interchangeable,
      sending the message that a hierarchical structure is expected in research teams,
      and that this hierarchical structure is directly linked to seniority. But one
      might question to what extent those expectations match reality. <strong>Is there
      such a strong link between career stages and researcher profiles? And what happens
      when researchers deviate from such expected roles?</strong></p><p>In this post
      we discuss our findings after designing a model based on a machine learning
      algorithm to predict the probability of scientists to contribute in specific
      ways over their complete career, based on the contribution statements of a seed
      of their publications. Based on our predictions we were able to identify different
      archetypes of researchers across career stages. We distinguished between four
      career stages and compared differences between archetypes of researchers based
      on their career length, productivity, citation impact and gender. We observed
      differences on career length based on the archetype, plus gender differences
      on the type of profile researchers have at their early-career.</p><figure><img

      1.</strong> Graphical representation of the career stages designed by the European
      Commission along with the expectations at each state, and an attempt at aligning
      them in a timeline.</span></p><h3>Distribution of labour and archetypes</h3><p>There
      is increasing evidence that scientists <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0162243917697192\"
      target=\"_blank\">tend to specialize on specific tasks</a> during their career
      in order to be more efficient when collaborating <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312716650046\"
      target=\"_blank\">to distribute the work among co-authors</a>. Authors\u2019
      contribution to publications <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1700404\"
      target=\"_blank\">is commonly associated with their position in author order</a>,
      signaling middle positions as those conducting more technical and specialised
      (e.g., applying advanced methodologies) tasks, while first and last positions
      are commonly reserved to those leading the work. Of course, if the unique career
      path ideal resembles reality, one would expect junior scientists to be earning
      their stripes first in middle positions and contributing with technical expertise
      and later on moving towards leading roles. But in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800478115\"
      target=\"_blank\">a recent study published in PNAS</a>, the authors suggested
      that there is an increasing number of middle authors who never reach these leading
      positions, and furthermore, that their presence is crucial to ensure scientific
      progress. But, is their middle position related to task specialisation as they
      seemed to imply?</p><p>To answer this question, we trained a prediction model
      using a dataset of over 70,000 publications from PLOS journals (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891055\"
      target=\"_blank\">all data has been made openly accessible</a>). This model
      used bibliographic and bibliometric variables to predict the probability of
      a given author to conduct a given contribution. We then retrieved the complete
      publication history of over 200,000 researchers from the original dataset, and
      predicted the probability of contributions for each paper and author. Figure
      2 shows the distribution of our predicted probabilities distinguished by the
      career stage in which researchers conduct each contribution.</p><figure style=\"width:100%;
      text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/DistributionGraphs.png\"
      data-image=\"15574\"></figure><p></p><p><span class=\"caption\"><strong>Figure
      2.</strong> Distribution of predicted probabilities of contributions for the
      complete history of researchers.</span></p><p></p><p>Just from inspecting these
      distributions, we do observe that some contributions are indeed more aligned
      with career stages than others, but that such distinction is not as clear as
      one would imagine. Still, we are not able to discern if individuals consistently
      carry on the same contributions when collaborating.</p><p>This is where we used
      Robust Archetypal Analysis, a technique that identifies archetypes, which accentuates
      specific features of individuals\u2019 population. To our surprise we found
      consistent similarities between archetypes across stages, with two archetypes
      at the junior stage (specialized and supporting), three at the early- and mid-career
      stages (leader, specialized and supporting), and two at the late-career stage
      (leader and supporting). Leader profiles are characterized by high probabilities
      on writing the paper and conceiving and designing the study. Specialized archetypes
      are researchers who are in charge of performing experiments, but also may play
      a role on the writing, conception of the study and analysis of data. Finally,
      supporting authors conduct more marginal contributions to papers.</p><h3>Career
      trajectories, productivity, impact and gender</h3><p>The archetypal analysis
      provides evidence that scientists specialize on specific tasks during their
      careers, but do they exhibit the same profile during their whole trajectory?
      Are there differences in their performance? Do we observe differences by gender
      on the profile of scientists? To answer these questions, an archetype was assigned
      to each researcher, at each career stage, and the trajectories of archetypes
      inspected. Figure 3 shows these flows. The first thing we notice is that a researcher\u2019s
      profile seems to influence their possibility of making it to the next stage.
      A larger share of leaders make it to the next stage, followed by specialized
      and last, supporting. Furthermore, leader profiles seem to be more versatile
      than the rest, that is, they seem to more easily shift from the leading profile
      to any of the other two.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/TrajectoriesOfScientists.png\"
      data-image=\"15575\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\"><strong><br>Figure
      3.</strong> Trajectories of scientists analyzed by archetype. Blue shows the
      specialized profile; green, supporting; and red, leader. </span></p><p></p><p>In
      terms of productivity and citations however, leaders and supporters show a better
      performance than specialists. This means that evaluation based on productivity
      and citation metrics may be undermining specific and indeed valuable profiles
      of researchers. But most worryingly, we find that there are gender differences
      at the early-career stage. That is, most male scientists at this stage show
      either a specialized or leader profile, while for women there is a strong bias
      towards the former. At this critical stage, this could be affecting women\u2019s
      career prospects in a definite way, as their performance is hindered by the
      type of tasks they perform, as our results suggest.</p><h3>Revising assumptions
      and looking forward</h3><p>This study is part of the \u2018<a href=\"https://ecosci.nrobinsongarcia.com/wp/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Unveiling the Ecosystem of Science</a>\u2019 project, in which
      we aim to systematically analyze the diversity of profiles in science, with
      the hope of devising methodological tools that can improve current evaluation
      systems. With this specific study we also look into the potential of surpassing
      <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/publishing-credit-where-credit-is-due-1.15033\"
      target=\"_blank\">the well-known limitations of authorship</a> by going beyond
      equal attribution of credit among authors. An example of this can be observed
      in Figure 4, where we look at the share of scientists by archetype and career
      stage publishing either as first, middle or last author. Here we observe that
      neither seniority nor archetype are always the ruling criteria as normally assumed.</p><figure><img

      a newly published paper in Minerva I have analyzed confidential reports from

      for more traditional qualitative evaluation of candidates.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      use of metrics is a hot topic in science, and scholars have criticized metrics
      for being more driven by data than by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038\">judgements</a>.
      Both the <a href=\"http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/\">Leiden Manifesto</a> and
      the <a href=\"http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/\">DORA-declaration</a>, signed
      by thousands of organizations and individuals, have expressed concerns about
      the use of metrics on individuals. Despite the critique metrics are used in
      academic hiring processes which represent critical junctures for academics deciding
      on their future careers. Although metrics are used in academic recruitment processes,
      there are few studies on how and with which importance they are used, and whether
      metrics have replaced or only supplemented the more traditional qualitative
      candidate evaluation. In a newly published paper in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11024-020-09419-0\">Minerva</a>\r\nI
      cover this research gap and show how metrics are applied chiefly as a screening
      tool to decrease the number of eligible candidates and not as a replacement
      for peer review.</p><p>The lack of knowledge of how metrics are used in recruitments
      could partly be due to the secrecy of these processes, where what happens is
      often highly confidential. However, with access to confidential documents from
      57 professor recruitments in sociology, physics, informatics and economics between
      2000 and 2017 at the University of Oslo, I was able to explore these black boxes.
      Going beyond more superficial accounts of whether metrics were used or not,
      I could unpack the evaluation of candidates and explore how metrics were used.
      With content analysis in NVivo I identified which criteria were used, when these
      criteria were used and how important they were for the ranking of the candidates.
      </p><p>These documents showed that research experience was the most important
      criterion in recruitment processes, while the candidates\u2019 teaching and
      dissemination experience were less valued. In these evaluations, metrics of
      research output were an important criterion but seldom the most important one.
      Contrary to the literature suggesting an escalation of metrics in academic recruitment,
      I instead detected foremost stable assessment practices with only a modestly
      increased reliance on metrics. Furthermore, paying attention to the candidate\u2019s
      volume of publications is no entirely new phenomena either, but has been a practice
      throughout the time period observed in my study. Still, I found a moderate increased
      reliance on metrics in these evaluations. </p><p>In the evaluation of candidates
      bibliometric indicators were primarily applied as a screening tool to reduce
      high numbers of candidates and not as a replacement of the qualitative peer
      review of the candidates\u2019 work. It is quite understandable that when universities
      receive applications by, e.g., over 40 candidates, they are not capable of evaluating
      them all but need to decrease the number of candidates for more thorough evaluations.
      Here, bibliometrics have proved to be a useful screening tool.</p><p>In the
      figure below I display the most important criteria used in the three different
      committees which the Norwegian academic recruitment processes consisted of.
      While metrics were the most important criteria in the selection committees,
      whose task it is to select eligible candidates, they were inferior when it came
      to the in-depth reading of the candidates\u2019 work in the expert committees.
      Here, tenured professors evaluated the candidates according to disciplinary
      standards. Moreover, in the last stage of the recruitment process, when interviewing
      the highest ranked candidate, metrics were neglected as the focus for these
      interviews was to evaluate the candidates\u2019 teaching experience and their
      social skills. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure-1-IR.PNG\"

      different committee types (percentage). N refers to the number of the most important
      assessment criterion/a in the different committees</figcaption></figure><p>The
      use of metrics was also strongly dependent on the evaluation cultures of different
      disciplines. In sociology, the evaluators\u2019 in-depth reading of the candidates\u2019
      work was still the most important, and in physics and informatics having the
      specific skills announced in the call was more important than having impressive
      publication lists. However, economics was an exception, where the number of
      top publications proved to be the most salient criterion. The next figure shows
      the most important criteria in the expert committee, where tenured professors
      evaluated the candidates.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure-2-IR.png\"
      alt=\"Figure 2 IR\"><figcaption>Figure 2. Most important assessment criteria
      in the expert committees by academic discipline (percentage). N refers to the
      number of important assessment criterion/a detected in the expert committee</figcaption></figure><p>The
      disciplines further relied on different types of metrics. Social sciences chiefly
      emphasized publication volumes and journal quality, while the natural sciences
      relied more strongly on various metrics such as the number of publications,
      citation scores and the number of conference proceedings. Figure 3 shows how
      often the different types of metrics were applied by the expert committees.</p><figure><img

      3 IR\"><figcaption>Figure 3. Metrics types applied by expert committees in each
      discipline (percentage). N refers to the number of arguments coded as metrics
      in the expert committee</figcaption></figure><p>My study thus reveals a more
      nuanced view of the use of metrics in the evaluation of individual researchers.
      Even though metrics are used in academic recruitments, this does not imply a
      fundamental change of these processes where metrics have overruled traditional
      peer reviews. Instead, the Norwegian case could hint to a moderate use of metrics,
      as for instance as a screening tool.</p><p>Nevertheless, although the use of
      metrics was moderate, I have not investigated whether the first screening process
      eliminated only irrelevant candidates or if the screening also excluded highly
      qualified candidates. Nor have I investigated more indirect effect, for example
      if the awareness of this screening makes researchers follow ideas where the
      prospect of publication in high ranked journals seems more likely. I thus encourage
      scholars to more closely study the effect of the use of metrics.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ingvild

      target=\"_blank\">latest research</a>&nbsp;reveals, the prestige of a book publisher
      yields points for getting government funding, not only in my home country Lithuania,
      but also in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and other countries. In these countries,
      institutions earn the maximum number of points for books issued by publishers
      ranked at the highest level, fewer points for books produced by publishers lingering
      at the entry level, and nothing when publishers do not qualify to enter the
      system. </p><p>In Lithuania, the decision whether a publisher is prestigious
      or not depends on the opinion of anonymous experts who assess physically submitted
      books. The prestige of a publisher is especially important for monographs in
      the sciences. Since only books published by prestigious (and only foreign) publishers
      earn a significant number of points (and funds), nothing is achieved if the
      experts decide that a publisher is not prestigious. It seems that nobody knows
      why some publishers were awarded the prestigious level in one year and designated
      as not prestigious in subsequent years, or the other way around. </p><h3>Hunting
      for points, trickling down incentives, and gaming the system </h3><p>As stated
      in <a href=\"https://npi.nsd.no/informasjon\" target=\"_blank\">the Norwegian
      Publication Indicator</a> and elsewhere, the levels of publishers were created
      to incentivise researchers to publish their books in the most prestigious channels
      within their field of study. </p><p>People respond to incentives differently.
      Nonetheless, such rankings of publishers and institutional strategies to achieve
      more funds have led to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2019.1706077\"
      target=\"_blank\">hunting for points</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scu087\"
      target=\"_blank\">trickling down incentives</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21325-1\"
      target=\"_blank\">gaming the system</a>. The more ambiguous the rules that are
      in place, the more prevalent gaming becomes. </p><p>My findings suggest that
      it is difficult to reach a common understanding of what it means to be a prestigious
      publisher.</p><h3>Are publishers rated consistently across countries and over
      time?</h3><p>Experts in different countries may have contradictory opinions
      on the prestige of a publisher. Figure 1 shows that the same publisher may be
      ranked as prestigious in Lithuania, as basic in Finland, and as not qualifying
      for points in Denmark and Norway. Consequently, depending on the country, books
      from the same publisher may yield the maximum, minimum, or zero points. </p><p>Even
      in a specific country, the level achieved by a publisher may fluctuate over
      time. As shown in Figure 1, Cambridge Scholars Publishing had the basic level
      between 2005 and 2018 in Norway; in the beginning of this period, it covered
      a quarter of all <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-011-0615-3\" target=\"_blank\">national
      book outputs in the social sciences and humanities</a>. The publisher lost the
      basic level in 2019. There are no apparent reasons which explain this change
      <a href=\"https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/KanalForlagInfo.action?id=19631&bibsys=false\"
      target=\"_blank\">in the Norwegian Registry</a>. Interestingly, the publisher
      regained its prior status in 2020.</p><div align=\"center\"><figure><img style=\"margin-bottom:8px;\"

      of the examples included <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06008\" target=\"_blank\">in
      my recent paper</a>, which examines not only the prestige of publishers but
      also the minimum requirements set for publishers. </p><p>As my findings suggest,
      there is no straightforward way to verify if a book publisher complies with
      the minimum mandatory prerequisites (displayed in the left part of Figure 2).
      </p><h3>An alternative approach to book assessment </h3><p>As seen from Figure
      2, the current rankings of book publishers are focused mostly on publishers\u2019
      gatekeeping. The current national regulations usually do not set prerequisites
      on publishers\u2019 contributions to the dissemination of academic research
      and scholarship. </p><p>My proposal is to start with the idea that there are
      several essential stages in scholarly book publishing:  quality control, production,
      dissemination (along with archiving), and marketing of books. However, publishers
      do not contribute equally to each of these steps. But every stage is vital for
      the quality of book outputs from the perspectives of research evaluation and
      <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2777/836532\" target=\"_blank\">scholarly communication</a>.</p><div

      The current model for publisher evaluation and an alternative model<br> proposed
      for&nbsp;assessment of scholarly books.</span><br></div><p>My idea is that publishers
      may decide which services they want to offer in each step but that they need
      to be transparent by providing data on the services they have delivered. It
      would be best if publishers give the relevant information as metadata for every
      book they publish (e.g. along with the ISBN of the book). Ideally, the metadata
      would be easily accessible and freely available through channels suitable for
      academics, publishers, librarians, and other parties involved in book publishing
      and assessment.</p><p>I presented the above idea at <a href=\"https://www.asist.org/2020/10/21/metrics-2020-workshop-on-informetric-and-scientometric-research-sig-met-program\"
      target=\"_blank\">Metrics 2020: Workshop on Informetric and Scientometric Research

      target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>My initial findings indicate that there are
      various publishing services for book outputs. The same book could even be peer
      reviewed, issued, distributed, and translated by different independent publishers
      (or non-publishing companies). Importantly, there is a need to define and label
      these services in a consistent way. </p><h3>Next steps </h3><p>Many questions
      still need to be answered, such as: how can the different services provided
      by publishers best be classified? Can publishers produce machine-readable metadata?
      Where can the metadata be stored and accessed? How can metadata be gathered
      and processed? </p><p>I will further investigate these questions in my PhD research.
      And I hope that the academic community, publishers, librarians, and infrastructure
      providers will also contribute to realising my proposed model for book assessment.</p><p>My

      CWTS solution to this question: organise an online retreat. Last year, CWTS
      organised its research retreat off-site in Noord-Brabant. This year, due to
      the pandemic, we organised an alternative. This even brought us to Thailand
      - virtually, of course. In this post, we share our experiences.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>Online
      or offline?</h3><p>Where to begin? In the spring of this year \u2013 right as
      Europe\u2019s \u201Cfirst wave\u201D hit \u2013 we started thinking about how
      to organise our second-ever research retreat. We considered several options.
      The preference was to once again organise the research retreat on the location
      of a beautiful repurposed monastery in the province of Noord-Brabant, like it
      was last year, this time keeping the 1.5 metres distance rule in mind. </p><p>By
      the time summer came around, it was clear that this idea was no longer feasible,
      the Netherlands now very much in the shadow of a rising infection rate. This
      meant that it was time for plan B: organising the retreat in a combination of
      so-called city hubs and online hubs. In cities where multiple colleagues live
      (or: live close by) colleagues could come together for the retreat. For the
      ones who wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable meeting in-person, online hubs would
      be created. </p><p>At the end of summer, it turned out that meeting in city
      hubs wouldn\u2019t be possible either, this time with rising infection rates
      accompanied by a partial nationwide lockdown. That\u2019s when we, at the last
      possible moment,  decided to go for plan C: organising the retreat completely
      online. This online retreat was divided over two days: on Thursday afternoon
      we organised an informal session where all our colleagues could join in on the
      fun. The next morning  researchers of CWTS came together for  an online <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-quackathon-quantitative-and-qualitative-hacking\"
      target=\"_blank\">Quackathon</a> organised by <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/vincent-traag\"
      target=\"_blank\">Vincent Traag</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/wolfgang-kaltenbrunner\"
      target=\"_blank\">Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner</a>, allowing researchers to collaborate
      with colleagues outside of their usual circles and develop mixed methods approaches
      to a particular issue, in this case open science. Fortunately, this was experienced
      as a good alternative by at least one of our colleagues:</p><p><em>\u201CWe
      </em><em>spent last year\u2019s retreat near the border with Belgium. This year
      we went fully online, and while I did miss having all colleagues in one place,
      it worked quite well. Thanks in large part to a great organizing team! One thing
      I loved is how the Quackathon</em><em>\r\nenabled us to work with others in
      CWTS we don\u2019t normally get a chance to engage with in a joint project because
      of time constraints. Though last year we were more flexible in moving around
      between groups, tables and flip-overs, we also made it work online and I truly
      enjoyed it.\u201D</em></p><h3>Offline travelling: to colleagues\u2019 living
      rooms and Thailand</h3><p>For the informal part of the retreat we asked participants
      beforehand to send a picture of their living room to one of the organisers.
      The first part of the retreat consisted of a quiz in which participants were
      asked to match the pictures of the living room to the right colleague. Spending
      much more time at home than usual, this seemed a nice way to get to know our
      colleagues better. This was easier said than done, of course, with some colleagues
      having more instantaneously recognizable surroundings than others.</p><div align=\"center\"><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/screenshot.png\" data-image=\"15301\"></figure><span
      class=\"caption\" style=\"margin-top:6px;\"><em>Figure 1. Concentration during
      the quiz \u201CWhich living room belongs to whom?\u201D</em></span></div><p><br>After
      this quiz, we moved on to an online escape room that we played in smaller groups.
      In this game, a private school\u2019s employee went missing and we had to find
      out where he was. He turned out to be in Thailand! The pictures of Thailand
      made some colleagues long for a holiday far away. One of our groups was incredibly
      quick and even achieved an all-time high score. The online escape room was received
      differently by our colleagues. Sometimes it was a challenge to connect to each
      other online and solve a puzzle together. After each group finished the escape
      room, the informal part of the retreat finished. From the feedback round it
      appeared that it would have been nice to have an online drink together as well,
      so that\u2019s something we should definitely do next time! Still, being able
      to attend such an event in-person would have been the preferred option, especially
      because of the difficulty of one-on-one social interactions and getting to know
      (new) colleagues in digital formats. As one of our colleagues \r\nsummarises:</p><p><em>\u201CThe
      online retreat was a great way for getting this community feeling again \u2013
      and you could really feel how everyone was \r\nexcited about this experience.
      But it was also a bit disappointing when the session was over and one had to
      face the actual distance again.\u201D</em></p><h3>Quackathon: the best of several
      (research) worlds</h3><p>Friday was the day of the Quackathon! A favourite from
      the previous year, most researchers looked forward to trying it again, this
      time online. A Quackathon is a sort of online pressure cooker where no information
      is provided beforehand, which can be especially challenging for research tasks
      which necessitate extensive reading in order to gather relevant information.
      However, putting together colleagues who either do more quantitative or more
      qualitative research also offered learning opportunities. For instance, one
      of our colleagues learned how to do qualitative coding in a very short time
      amount. As the next blogposts about the research retreat will show, this is
      exactly why we spend time on events like the Quackathon, designed to push us

      is the last blog post on the Evaluative Inquiry, the new approach to research
      evaluation that CWTS has been developing since 2017, following one on <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-i-academic-value-is-more-than-performance\"><strong>broadening
      the concept of academic value</strong></a>,<strong></strong><strong><a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\">evaluating
      research in context</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and<strong></strong><a
      href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-iii-mixing-methods-for-evaluating-research\"><strong>mixing
      methods</strong></a>.</em></p><p>In evaluations of any kind people often distinguish
      between summative and formative evaluations (see for example the classic <a
      href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?hl=nl&lr=&id=inSWTrbjcQ0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA5&dq=evaluations+summative+and+formative+handbook&ots=-ckustNdAM&sig=hT4flAfT_ENpC08MLQmp0LBWFfw#v=onepage&q=evaluations%20summative%20and%20formative%20handbook&f=false\">Evaluator\u2019s
      Handbook</a> from 1987). Summative evaluations are carried out to ensure accountability
      for past work. They test whether investments have led to the desired outcomes
      in order to formulate statements about the effectiveness of policy instruments
      and to support decisions about the allocation of funding. Formative evaluations
      are, on the contrary, primarily concerned with learning for improvement: they
      assess processes and mechanisms in order to formulate recommendations to improve
      them. </p><p>Originally, the focus of the evaluation of research was on accountability.
      In order to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:MINE.0000005155.70870.bd\">justify
      investments in public research</a>\r\ngovernments wanted to know the returns
      on these investments and university managers were looking for data and insights
      to inform the allocation of money among different faculties and research groups.
      Yet, evaluation reports <em>implicitly</em>\r\nalso produced relevant lessons
      for the research units under evaluation, either in the form of recommendations,
      or as observations or interpretations of their activities that fed back into
      the group\u2019s discussions about research directions, organizational matters
      or human resources. </p><p>While learning and accountability are different purposes
      and distinguishing between these is important, we do not see a contradiction
      between accountability and learning in the practice of research evaluation.
      Research evaluations can perfectly serve both purposes at the same time and,
      as said, implicitly often do. The evaluative inquiry <em>explicitly</em> works
      towards both purposes. It would be a waste of energy and resources to organize
      evaluations solely for accountability and not use them as a learning opportunity.
      </p><p>The latest rendition of the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf\">Dutch
      Strategic Evaluation Protocol</a> (2021-2027) fortunately expanded the space
      for learning, focusing on goals and strategy rather than metric assessment.
      Academic research units are now evaluated in terms of research quality, societal
      relevance, and viability with special attention for Open Science, PhD policy
      and training, academic culture and HR policy. The groups under evaluation themselves
      decide which indicators they want to be evaluated on. Moreover, research evaluation
      is a crucial part of quality assurance, which is now a topic of yearly conversations
      with the board of the institute. All these elements of the current SEP protocol
      clearly promote self-reflection and learning as part of a strategy towards viable,
      relevant and well-recognized and used research. </p><p>The Evaluative Inquiry
      most directly feeds into the first phase of the evaluation process when the
      academic unit needs to prepare its self-evaluation document. Insights are helpful
      much beyond, however, most notably for research strategy and organizational
      planning. Carrying out a self-evaluation under the new SEP can be quite demanding
      for research groups. Firstly, they have to make their aims and strategy explicit.
      As research aims and strategy of many research groups are implicit, making this
      explicit for a SEP evaluation requires work that an external party can help
      with. Secondly, the unit is expected to reflect in a coherent, narrative way
      on how it actually performs and organizes its research to achieve its strategic
      aims. Our experience is that many groups struggle with this. Describing performance
      in the form of a narrative is not what academic environments are used to. Especially
      the integration of research quality and societal relevance in one text can be
      challenging. Lastly, as organizations of any kind, academic units have cultures
      and are collectives of people with different opinions. Bringing in external
      research evaluation specialists helps to facilitate the putting together of
      the self-evaluation document as well as the larger conversation around the missions
      and ambitions of the collective. </p><p>The Evaluative Inquiry supports academic
      units in crystalizing goals, missions, visions and strategy, taking stock of
      the diversity of output, making the multitude of stakeholder relations visible,
      and listing staff opinions about the academic organization. Building on a combination
      of scientometric and qualitative analyses this work helps to make visible whether
      what people say what they do (their missions and strategies), is in fact what
      they do (their output and their collaborations), and whether their academic
      organizations are aligned with this (SWOT). The Evaluative Inquiry helps to
      navigate the academic unit through this inspiring and sometimes thorny process
      towards a solid self-evaluation document as well as better informed research
      strategy and organizational planning more generally.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Tjitske

      2019. A team of seven at CWTS is hectically working on the launch of the institute\u2019s
      new science blog. Getting the last settings in WordPress right, preparing a
      quick announcement, entering the first posts (so that things don\u2019t look
      too empty) \u2013 we (the editorial team) were rather excited. </p><p>53 blog
      posts later, it is time to reflect a bit. Admittedly, we started out rather
      open-mindedly. There wasn\u2019t much that we could have foreseen back then.
      Beginning with the quirky name, we wanted this blog to be a playful and accessible
      way of communicating the research done at CWTS. All of that while maintaining
      a rather broad range of topics. Anything related to Science of Science, Scientometrics,
      Evaluation Studies - you name it. </p><p>Admittedly, <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/welcome-to-leiden-madtrics\">our
      initial goals</a> felt quite ambitious, even given our enthusiasm. But \u2013
      editing a blog is a task one grows with over time. And it\u2019s not about doing
      it perfectly, either. What counts is just to slowly gain experience and routine
      and also, to have a team to share the burden with. And not to forget our authors
      who provided all the posts! In the end, it is thanks to them that editing a
      science blog is fun (most of the time).</p><p>We hope that you, our readers,
      could also gain a bit from following the blog. Maybe you have found your very
      own reason to stop by and look around? Be it finding out more about meta-science,
      learning about new topics, or just killing some time \u2013 we are sure that
      there have been posts for which it was worth it. Let\u2019s go on a quick tour
      and delve into some of our highlights from the past year!</p><p>To begin with,
      Covid-19 not only had an impact on everyone\u2019s life but got its fair share
      on the blog as well. <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/tags/covid-19\">Twelve
      entire blog posts</a> were dedicated or related to this topic (and maybe there
      are yet more to come?). Actually, we liked most of them quite a bit. Here, we
      would just like to highlight the three posts that reflected on the social implications
      of the lockdown, written by our authors <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/how-does-a-lockdown-affect-a-visiting-researcher-some-reflections-during-the-period-of-the-covid-19-lockdown\">Carey</a>,

      </p><p>Observant readers of Leiden Madtrics might have noticed that delineations
      of science of all sorts have been a recurrent theme. These posts have hopefully
      contributed to a better understanding of e.g., how science can be mapped according
      to the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/consensus-and-dissensus-in-mappings-of-science-for-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs\">SDGs</a>,

      related research</a> are.</p><p>Open Science enjoys some prominence on the blog
      as well. Be it on the topic of <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs\">open

      of the FAIR-principles to scientific publications</a>, this topic is hard to
      miss. </p><p>Sometimes, our authors contribute <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/where-do-scholars-move-measuring-the-mobility-of-researchers-across-academic-institutions\">a
      full-blown study</a> as a blog post. That is, of course, great, but can give
      the editors some headache when it involves implementing fancy Tableau visualizations\u2026
      But in the end, we can learn from that as well.</p><p>One might ask: where actually
      do the \u2018metrics\u2019 as in \u2018Madtrics\u2019 come in? A pertinent example
      are the indicators in the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2020\">Leiden
      Ranking 2020</a>. Or consider the series on the Evaluative Inquiry and research

      the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\">context

      evaluation is done, in part, by evaluating the papers produced by the university.
      However, universities don\u2019t produce papers, right? People produce papers!
      In this blogpost we illustrate how you can use the number of papers produced
      by individuals to evaluate universities.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p><strong>Why should you care?</strong></p><p>How
      do you evaluate a university? This question does not have an easy answer. However,
      there is an attribute that is typically considered relevant: the production
      of scientific papers. However, papers are not created by the university <em>per
      se</em>, they are created by <em>individuals </em>who are affiliated to a university.
      Currently, how individuals contribute to the scientific output of a university
      (e. g. number of papers produced per individual) is not a parameter considered
      in university evaluations, in part because it is difficult to get the necessary
      data. But now this data has become more readily available thanks to advances
      in machine learning and improvements in the metadata available in most scientometric
      databases. In this post we briefly illustrate how we can use such data to analyze
      universities differently, incorporating a more human dimension in the discussion
      of how science is being produced.</p><p>We would like to know the contribution
      of each individual to the university production of papers and analyze how the
      contributions are distributed among the individuals affiliated to that university.
      Recently, new<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12746\"> disambiguation algorithms
      </a>allow us to more accurately identify the different individuals active in
      the production of scientific papers. At the same time, new developments in the
      tracking of the linkages between authors and their affiliations at the publication
      level have opened the possibility of determining who is affiliated with what
      university in each scientific paper. These developments pave the way to more
      advanced forms of scientometric analysis, like for example <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/where-do-scholars-move-measuring-the-mobility-of-researchers-across-academic-institutions\">mobility
      studies</a>.</p><p>In this blogpost we illustrate how these data also allow
      us to study the individuals affiliated to universities, and how they contribute
      differently to the scientific output of their universities, thus allowing for
      a far more in depth analysis on how universities produce their results, moving
      beyond the mere publication analysis of the university outputs.</p><p><strong>How
      does it work?</strong></p><p>Take a university and all its publications. Then
      identify all the individuals (i.e. disambiguated authors) that are affiliated
      to that university in the set of publications. Count the publications for each
      individual. Of course, the sum of the number of papers of all individuals affiliated
      to a university is greater than the number of papers affiliated to the university
      because the same paper can be authored by several individuals from the same
      university. To fix this, we need to divide the weight of a paper among the authors
      of the same university. This represents the contribution of an individual to
      that paper. If we sum all the contributions of an individual, we get the contribution
      of that individual to the paper production of her university. Figure 1 illustrates
      this process. Let\u2019s suppose a university has 3 publications, and no external
      collaboration. These publications are represented in column B (P1, P2, P3).
      Column A represents the weight of that publication for the count of publications
      of the university (i.e. in total the university has produced 3 publications).
      These publications have been authored by 3 different individuals represented
      in column D (I1, I2, I3). Column C captures the different contributions of each
      individual to each of the publications, while column E captures the net contribution
      of each individual to the overall output of the university. <em>Et voil\xE0</em>,
      from a plain set of publications, we now have a much richer set of information
      of how these publications have been carried out within the university.</p><div

      calculate the contributions of individuals. A: Contributions to productivity
      per paper. B: Papers. C: Mapping of contributions from papers to individuals.
      D: Individuals. E: Contributions to productivity per individual.</sub></p></div><p>Based
      on this much richer information, it is now possible to perform much more advanced
      analyses on the output of the university. For example, now it is possible to
      analyze the distribution of the contributions. To do so, we use a Lorenz curve,
      which is used by economists to analyze the distribution of income in a country.
      From this curve, we can calculate the Gini index, which will tell us how concentrated
      the distribution of contributions is. Gini index 0.0 means perfect equality
      and Gini index 1.0 means that all the papers are produced by one person.</p><p><strong>Applying
      it to real life</strong></p><p>We created a Lorenz curve for each of the ~1000
      universities of the Leiden Ranking (LR). With this data, we calculated the average
      Gini index of the LR universities (0.59 +- 0.03) and the average values of the
      curves at 9 points (see Figure 2). In order to illustrate how this can be used
      to analyze specific universities, we also plotted the Lorenz curve of Tilburg
      University and Erasmus University, since these universities have the most extreme
      values of the Gini index for the Dutch universities (0.56 and 0.65, respectively).</p><p>The
      most revealing finding is that 70% of the least productive individuals in a
      university contribute to about 25% of the papers of a university, which is in
      line with previous observations about the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S175115771400087X\">skewness
      of scientific productivity</a>. However, the distributions of Tilburg University
      and Erasmus University sit at opposite extremes of the world average. Tilburg
      is somehow more <em>egalitarian </em>than Erasmus in terms of individual contribution
      to its production. </p><div align=\"center\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure-2-Juan.png\"

      a mode of conclusion</strong></p><p>We have illustrated how new data science
      developments in scientometric databases allow for new approaches to analyze
      universities, illustrated by the use of the Gini index to characterize the contributions
      of individuals to the scientific production of universities. This approach opens
      the possibility of measuring new attributes of universities, more related to
      their workforce than just their output, thus positioning the individual at the
      center of the academic system, and supporting a more <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/thematic-hubs/science-in-the-anthropocene\">anthropogenic
      perspective</a> in science studies. Our intention is to continue the exploration
      of this perspective, and to start a discussion on which of these attributes
      could become more supportive evaluation metrics.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Juan

      data sets are increasingly expected to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Over
      the past two decades, the open access movement has made significant progress
      in promoting the free <em>accessibility</em> and <em>reusability</em> of scholarly
      publications. About half of the publications from recent years are free to access
      and reuse. However, are accessibility and reusability sufficient for a well-functioning
      system of scholarly publishing? While accessibility and reusability are essential,
      I believe a broader perspective on open access is needed.</p><h3>Findability
      and interoperability</h3><p>Researchers and other users of the scholarly literature
      spend large amounts of time trying to find the publications that are most relevant
      to their needs. Obviously, accessibility and reusability of publications are
      of little use if it is hard to find relevant publications in the first place.
      <em>Findability</em> of publications therefore is just as important as accessibility
      and reusability.</p><p>One approach to improve the findability of publications
      is to create an infrastructure in which the text of publications is made available
      in a machine readable way and in which interfaces are provided to enable humans
      and machines to perform text-based searches. Such an infrastructure should be
      as inclusive as possible, so it should not be artificially restricted to publications
      from specific publishers or platforms. In addition, the infrastructure should
      be fully flexible in the way in which it enables the text of publications to
      be searched.</p><p>Performing text-based searches is of course just one way
      in which humans and machines may try to find relevant publications. There are
      many other approaches as well. One approach for instance is to search for publications
      of a specific researcher or research organization or to search for publications
      in a specific journal. Another approach is to start from a seed set of relevant
      publications and to search for related publications by tracing citation links
      from the seed set to other publications.</p><p>This highlights the importance
      of <em>interoperability</em>. Publications are connected to each other by citation
      links. They also have links with other types of entities, such as the journal
      in which they have appeared, the license under which they have been made available,
      the data sets and source codes of which they make use, the researchers by whom
      they are authored, and the organizations with which these researchers are affiliated
      or by which they are funded. To facilitate interoperability, publications need
      to be enriched with metadata that captures these links. In addition to being
      open, this metadata should as much as possible make use of persistent identifiers,
      such as DOIs and ORCIDs.</p><h3>Making publications FAIR</h3><p>A well-functioning
      system of scholarly publishing requires publications not only to be freely accessible
      and reusable, but also to be findable and interoperable. In other words, publications
      should comply with the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable)
      principles, just as scholarly data sets are increasingly expected to be<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18\"
      target=\"_blank\"> FAIR</a>.</p><p>There is a growing consensus in the scientific
      community on the importance of open access. Governments, funding agencies, research
      organizations, scholarly societies, publishers, and individual researchers increasingly
      share a commitment to making publications free to access and reuse, even though
      they do not always agree on the best way to reach this goal. Making publications
      findable and interoperable requires a similar commitment. In particular, it
      requires stakeholders to work together to create infrastructures that provide
      high-quality open metadata on publications (and ideally also the full text of
      publications). Although several initiatives have been taken, the availability
      of high-quality open metadata is still limited, leading to a situation in which
      publications are increasingly free to access and reuse, while their findability
      and interoperability are still significantly hampered.</p><p>The scientific
      community has a responsibility not only to make publications freely accessible
      and reusable, but also to make them findable and interoperable. The FAIRness
      of publications can be improved by supporting efforts such as<a href=\"http://www.metadata2020.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\"> Metadata 2020</a>, the<a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">
      Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)</a>, the<a href=\"https://i4oa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">
      Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA)</a>, the<a href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\">
      Research Organization Registry (ROR)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.project-freya.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\">FREYA</a>, and other related initiatives. Making publications
      FAIR also requires careful thinking about the governance and funding of infrastructures
      for open metadata. Just as publishers, funding agencies, research organizations,
      and other stakeholders are discussing ways to make publications freely accessible
      and reusable, they also need to discuss ways to improve the findability and
      interoperability of publications.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/\"

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p></p><p><em>Why
      is it so difficult to think of new possible worlds? </em>This is a question
      Marta Hejer and Wytske Versteeg ask <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2018.1510339\"
      target=\"_blank\">in a recent paper for </a><em><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2018.1510339\"
      target=\"_blank\">Territory, Politics, Governance</a></em>. It is a question
      I ask myself almost every day.  </p><p>Hejer\r\n and Versteeg contend that 'use
      of fossil fuels is deeply embedded in \r\nour societal values and everyday routines'
      and that 'as a consequence, \r\nwe lack coherent imaginaries of alternative
      post-fossil futures'. \r\nImagination, for them as well as for me, is inextricably
      linked to the \r\ncapacity to change.  </p><p>So what might help academics imagine?
      As an old English teacher used to tell me, you are what you read \u2013 so why
      not something a bit more fantastical?  </p><p>When I say <em>fantasy</em>, think
      of more than <em>Harry Potter</em> or the <em>Hunger Games</em>: think of (amongst
      many others) classics of magical realism like Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s <em>Master
      and Margarita </em>or the more contemporary surrealism of Salman Rushdie\u2019s
      <em>Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights; </em>think of Emily St John
      Mandel\u2019s eerie post-apocalyptic <em>Station Eleven </em>or Isobelle Carmody\u2019s
      epic <em>Obernewtyn</em><em> Chronicles. </em>Fantasy books are not just children\u2019s
      books. When we relegate fantasy to the realm of adolescent escapism and insist
      that we have more important things to read, we collectively fail to <em>take
      new possible worlds seriously. </em>We make it harder for ourselves to begin
      to think of new possible worlds.  </p><p>One vibrant example of what can happen
      when you combine social scientific practice with speculative fiction is <a href=\"https://radicaloceanfutures.earth/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Radical
      Ocean Futures</a>, an art-science exhibit developed by the Stockholm Resilience
      Center in 2014. The project presents\r\n four possible futures for our ocean,
      worlds in 2070 where there is no \r\nland or there are no fish - but none in
      which the world continues with \r\n\u2018business as usual\u2019 and everything
      turns out ok. The team developed \r\nshort stories, audio-bytes, and scientific
      papers to make their case. </p><p>As we continue our steady march into what
      some call the Anthropocene, others <a href=\"https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=779\"
      target=\"_blank\">the Capitalocene</a> (Moore 2016), we must engage with radical
      possibilities for a world that is <em>otherwise</em>. In this spirit, I here
      suggest three fantasy novels for imagining new possible worlds. </p><p></p><ol><li><strong>For
      the History Buff - Naomi Novak\u2019s <em>His Majesty\u2019s Dragon </em>(2006)
      </strong><br>Everything is better with dragons \u2013 including the Napoleonic
      Wars. Novak brings you dragons like you\u2019ve never known them before: Temeraire
      is as charismatic and complex as his master, naval captain William Lawrence.
      The novel is fast-paced without sacrificing the intricate details of military
      warfare in the late-eighteenth century and is the\r\n first of seven books through
      which Novak meticulously tackles issues of\r\n race, coloniality, and the inevitability
      of history. A spirited read that will leave you wondering if there really weren\u2019t
      dragons back then, after all. \r\n<br><br></li><li><strong>For the Strong Female
      Lead \u2013 N. K. Jemisin\u2019s <em>The Fifth Season </em>(2015)  </strong><br>What\u2019s
      that? A believable heroine? Never\r\n mind fantasy novels that forget women
      in their middle age \u2013 on the \r\ncontrary, this story revolves around one.
      In a world where the \r\napocalypse is just another season (hence the title
      of the book), follow Essun into the depths of political intrigue on her quest
      to find her kidnapped daughter. This thought-provoking novel will leave you
      questioning a number of appropriately STS-ey themes, including time, perspective,
      and the very nature of what you know. \r\n<br><br></li><li><strong>For the Wandering
      Soul \u2013 Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s <em>The Farthest Shore</em> (1972) </strong><br>This
      story follows a middle-aged wizard and a young prince as they set out to understand
      why magic across the land is losing its power. The third book of her Earthsea
      cycle, this volume stands out to me because it is clearly written\r\n with the
      delicacy and sensibility of the most practiced ethnographer \r\n(after all,
      the K. in her name refers to her father, American \r\nanthropologist Alfred
      Kroeber). Her steady, straightforward prose will carry you on a journey quite
      literally to the ends of the earth. \r\n</li></ol><p></p><p>I leave you with
      this: imagination is not a gift, but a skill \u2013 one that we must commit
      to practicing as much as any other if imagining new possible worlds is to get
      any easier in the days and months to come. Happy reading! </p><p></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Jackie

      can contribute to wider social well-being.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p></p><p>Barry Bozeman\u2019s
      <a href=\"https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/\"
      target=\"_blank\">new article on \u2018Public Value Science\u2019</a> raises
      one of the most fundamental questions in science policy: <em>Who benefits from
      science?</em>\r\nHis answer is clear: right now the benefits tend to go to the
      rich while the \xADnegative impacts, such as unemployment or pollution, differentially
      affect the poor. Bozeman thus concludes that science and technology can be a
      regressive force in society as they reinforce current social inequalities.</p><p>The
      argument is sharp, sound and convincing. Although it is focused in the US, it
      is a relevant discussion across the globe, even in welfare democracies such
      as the Netherlands or Sweden. Many innovations related to economic growth reduce
      job opportunities to low and middle classes. Many innovations related to consumption
      are mainly enjoyed by those who can afford them\u2013even in health. And the
      harm caused by innovation affects more directly disenfranchised communities.</p><p>Under
      the special status that science enjoyed in the 20<sup>th</sup> century as a
      central factor in \u2018modernity\u2019, science policy seldom took notice that
      innovation could do harm. If there were negative outcomes to knowledge production
      this was assumed to be the result of inadequate downstream policies for environmental,
      health or welfare issues\u2013not a problem of science policy. Irrespective
      of research agendas, it was seldom questioned that science would or could result
      in benefits for all.</p><p>The importance of Bozeman\u2019s article lies in
      highlighting that many <em>research trajectories (</em>or <em>directions</em>)
      supported by public policies are surprisingly well-aligned with dominant economic
      and political interests\u2013rather than being concerned with wider social benefits.
      This is obvious in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">publicly funded health research</a>, with a relative focus
      on expensive treatments and chronic diseases of wealthy nations which is astonishingly
      similar to private R&D. Yet in other sectors as well incumbent groups can be
      seen to shape research agendas according to their interests rather than the
      public good. See, for example, the persistently large investment in nuclear
      fusion research (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/eu-leaders-slash-science-spending-18-trillion-deal\"
      target=\"_blank\">still \u20AC5bn, thus 6% of all European Commission research
      spending for 2021-27</a>) in spite of the current success of greener renewable
      technologies.  Thus, science tends to benefit more the wealthy than the poor
      because research agendas are shaped in a variety of both explicit and invisible
      ways by incumbent groups (by the political economy) without open debate on public
      values and wider societal benefits.</p><p>The picture drawn by Bozeman is concordant
      with diagnoses presented in recent years by innovation studies scholars such
      as <a href=\"https://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/Innovation-Democracy.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Andy Stirling</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2018.08.011\"
      target=\"_blank\">Johan Schot</a> or <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/mazzucato_report_2018.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Mariana Mazzucato</a>. However, the proposals for improvement
      by the different authors have interesting differences in emphasis. Mazzucato\u2019s
      focus is on (rather top-down) state-led missions that would spearhead innovation
      in directions consistent with public values. Building on sustainability transition
      theory, Schot proposes that transformative change in innovation systems need
      the coordination (orchestrated by state policy) of the various actors involved.
      Research can indeed contribute to change innovation pathways but it will only
      succeed when synchronised with ongoing transformations downstream. Concerned
      about how allegedly <em>progressive</em> transformations become captured by
      particular interests even when led by public policy, Stirling emphasises the
      need for supporting a diversity of innovation trajectories and plurality of
      perspectives in appraisal of agendas. He thus stresses participation, precaution
      and responsibility given that the benefits of science are often not self-evident,
      and that different social groups may have disparate preferences.</p><p>Bozeman
      proposes a five-step program for making science more attuned to benefiting all
      citizens:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Graduate education on science\u2019s social contributions</li><li>Evaluation
      of research impacts</li><li>Ring-fencing curiosity-driven science while making
      other research more accountable</li><li>Diversifying the research working force</li><li>Fostering
      public participation on the goals of science</li></ol><p>I would fully endorse
      Bozeman\u2019s plan -- let me notice its similarity with some of the European
      initiatives on <a href=\"https://www.rri-tools.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Responsible
      Research and Innovation</em></a>, e.g. in terms of gender or participation.
      Now, its comparison with Mazzucato, Schot and Stirling\u2019s perspectives raises
      interesting questions. Are decentralised and piece-meal steps as suggested by
      Bozeman more likely to succeed than grand schemes as in Mazzucato\u2019s missions?
      To which extent should or could public agents coordinate with innovation actors
      (further downstream) to achieve transitions <em>\xE0 la</em> Schot? How can
      a \u2018public value science\u2019 be supported in controversial contexts (in
      labour, environment) while keeping Stirling\u2019s attention for diversity and
      plurality? </p><p>Bozeman\u2019s provocation succeeds in showing that a sizeable
      part of research is now serving mainly the privileged and potentially harming
      the disenfranchised\u2013and in spurring much needed-debate on how science policies
      could help in making research (again?) a progressive force in society.</p><p><em>(This

      just two examples. Inspired by such knowledge graph (KG) success stories in
      the general domain, such technology is now being realized over scholarly knowledge
      as well. In this vein, we highlight the<a href=\"https://www.tib.eu/en/\"> TIB</a>-led
      project<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3360901.3364435\"> Open Research

      platform, stores and publishes such graphs as persistent knowledge items. You
      can browse this digital library and its scholarly knowledge <a href=\"https://www.orkg.org/orkg/\">here</a>!</p><p>Since
      scientific literature is growing at a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7612-457a\">rapid
      rate</a> and researchers today are faced with a <a href=\"https://www.stm-assoc.org/about-the-industry/stm-report-2015-2/\">publications
      deluge</a>, it is increasingly tedious, if not practically impossible to keep
      up with the research progress even within one's own narrow discipline. The<a
      href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1157185\"> ORKG</a> then is posited as
      a solution to the problem of keeping track of research progress minus the cognitive
      overload that reading dozens of full papers impose. It aims to build a comprehensive
      knowledge graph that publishes just the research contributions of scholarly
      publications per paper where the framework can then intelligently compute paperwise
      or aggregated scholarly knowledge highlights for researchers.</p><p>Naturally,
      then, one wonders what information should be captured in such scholarly contributions\u2019
      knowledge-focused graphs? Within the <a href=\"https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks\">SemEval
      2021</a>: NLPContributionGraph (NCG) Shared Task, we seek both to answer and
      to discover better answers to this question. We have formalized a scholarly
      contributions-focused graph model over NLP scholarly articles that will be applied
      to annotate hundreds of NLP articles for their contributions. The corpus will
      be freely released to the NCG task participants, based on which they will be
      able to train and test automated machine learners. In essence, such systems
      will read \u201Ccontributions\u201D information in a subject-predicate-object
      structured format to be integrable within Knowledge Graph infrastructures such
      as the<a href=\"https://www.orkg.org/orkg/\"> ORKG</a>. The corpus annotation
      data elements will include: (1) contribution sentences - a set of sentences
      about the contribution in the article; (2) scientific terms and relations -
      a set of scientific terms and relational cue phrases extracted from the contribution
      sentences; and (3) triples - semantic statements that pair scientific terms
      with a relation, modeled toward subject-predicate-object Resource Description
      Framework (a standard model for data interchange on the Web, commonly referred
      to as RDF) statements for KG building. The task is to automatically extract
      these elements given a new NLP article. Have a look at our <a href=\"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2658/paper2.pdf\">pilot

      we raised a few questions: <em>What if scholarly knowledge communicated in the
      scholarly literature would be FAIR, also for machines? What if the global scholarly
      knowledge base would be more than a repository of digital documents? How would
      this change the global access to as well as the reuse of scholarly knowledge?</em></p><p>NLPContributionGraph

      recent years, bibliometric databases have substantially improved the consistency
      and quality of the metadata extracted from publications, particularly the author-affiliations
      linkages from scientific publications. Furthermore, author-name disambiguation
      algorithms have been implemented for most large bibliometric databases, such
      as <a href=\"https://www.webofknowledge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>,
      <a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scopus</a>, and <a href=\"http://dimensions.ai\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a>. Most of these algorithms benefit from open
      systems for the unique identification of scholars like <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">ORCID</a>. These developments have led to new <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157718300865\"
      target=\"_blank\">scientometric approaches</a> to track aggregated <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28980663\"
      target=\"_blank\">mobility patterns</a> between countries and regions.</p><p>However,
      when it comes to the mobility of researchers between institutions,  evidence
      is scarce  due to the lack of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article-abstract/3/1/56/1585559?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">harmonized affiliation data</a> at the micro level. This situation
      is changing due to the implementation of advanced approaches for affiliation
      harmonization like the approach used for the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.22708\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking</a>, or, more recently, the Global Research
      Identifier Database (<a href=\"https://grid.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">GRID</a>),
      that currently covers more than 98,000 research institutions worldwide. The
      availability of these harmonized registries enables the identification of affiliation
      changes in the careers of scholars. In this blog post, we illustrate how author-affiliation
      information can be used to develop mobility indicators at the institutional
      level and explore the many possibilities this offers for the study of scientific
      mobility.</p><h3>Measuring the institutional mobility of scholars</h3><p>There
      are many <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157718300865\"
      target=\"_blank\">different forms of mobility</a>, and the interpretation of
      such forms may vary from case to case. To keep things simple, we focus only
      on the distinction of institutionally <em>mobile </em>vs. <em>non-mobile</em>.
      Specifically, we consider that a researcher is institutionally mobile when she
      is <em>affiliated to more than one institution</em> in a given timeframe. Based
      on this broad definition, we categorize researchers into two different mutually
      exclusive groups: </p><ul><li><em>Non-mobile</em>, researchers who have been
      only affiliated to one institution during the period of analysis.</li><li><em>Mobile,
      </em>researchers who have been affiliated to more than one institution in the
      period of analysis.</li></ul><h3>The dataset: identifying researchers and their
      institutions</h3><p>We use the <a href=\"http://dimensions.ai\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a>
      data dump updated until June 2019 that is available at <a href=\"http://www.cwts.nl\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS</a>, selecting only publications from the period 2015-2018.
      This time period is the same as the one used in the most recent release of the
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking</a>.
      </p><p>Mobility research using bibliometric data relies on the connections between
      authors and publications. Dimensions data allow the authors to be directly linked
      to their publication level affiliations. In order to link publications with
      individual scholars, Dimensions implements an <a href=\"http://www.library.spbu.ru/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Guide-to-Dimensions-Data-Approach-2018.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">author-disambiguation algorithm</a>, allowing to know which
      publications were authored by which author in their database.  This algorithm
      has a higher level of <em>precision (i.e. How many identified publications truly
      belong to the given researcher?)</em> than <em>recall (Are all researchers\u2019
      publications correctly identified?)</em>. While higher precision is a desired
      property for an author-disambiguation algorithm, the lower recall may lead to
      underestimation of the number of mobile researchers, since some of their publications
      (and affiliations) may not be identified. </p><p>In order to track scholars\u2019
      movements at the institutional level, we combine the affiliation information
      of those articles with the unique institutional affiliation names available
      in the GRID. Given the large scope of organizations included in GRID, and in
      order to work with a homogeneous set of institutions, we crossmatched 1,176
      distinct Leiden Ranking institutions with GRID identifiers. We found a total
      of 1,169 organizations that had a GRID identifier and appeared in the latest
      release of the Leiden Ranking (2020). Therefore, we adopt the methodology of
      the Leiden Ranking for the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job\"
      target=\"_blank\">identification of institutions</a>. This limits our analysis
      to a set of well-established universities.</p><h3>Global institutional mobility</h3><figure

      spellcheck=\"false\">Figure 1. Main institutional mobility patterns of Leiden
      Ranking universities (mobility restricted to LR universities) - the size of
      circles represents the number of scholars with at least one publication affiliated
      with a Leiden Ranking university between 2015 and 2018. The color represents
      the share of researchers that were affiliated to another Leiden Ranking institution
      in the same period. Universities in red are those with more than 22% (which
      is the average of all universities in the set) of its affiliated researchers
      with mobility, while blue indicates a share of institutionally mobile researchers
      below that threshold. <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/rodrigo4482#!/vizhome/Dashboard_LR_focus/Mobility_LR_Universities_explore\"
      target=\"_blank\">Explore Tableau version in a new tab</a></figcaption><p></p><p>Figure
      1 shows the propensity to mobility within universities included in the Leiden
      Ranking. The results indicate that North American, Australian and Northern European
      universities exhibit a relatively high level of institutional mobility. Countries
      in Southern and Eastern Europe show lower levels of institutional mobility,
      something that is also observed in South America, Africa, and Asia, including
      Japan and South Korea.</p><p>An important element to consider when studying
      mobility with bibliometric indicators is to which extent publications of researchers
      provide reliable signals of mobility. In order to test this for the results
      in Figure 1, we performed a test studying only those researchers with <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/rodrigo4482#!/vizhome/Dashboard_LR_focus_5/Mobility_LR_Univ_5_pubs_explore\"
      target=\"_blank\"><strong>exactly 5 publications</strong></a>. This returned
      patterns very similar to those in Figure 1.</p><p>So far we analyzed only mobility
      events for Leiden Ranking universities. This approach allows tracking mobility
      among a relatively homogeneous set of institutions but does not capture the
      mobility events of researchers with institutions that are not covered by the
      Leiden Ranking. For example, we did not track mobility linkages of researchers
      with other local universities and with other types of research organizations
      in the government sector and elsewhere (e.g. thematic or umbrella research organizations
      like <a href=\"https://www.inserm.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\">Inserm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.csic.es\"
      target=\"_blank\">CSIC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnrs.fr\" target=\"_blank\">CNRS</a>,
      <a href=\"https://www.cnr.it/\" target=\"_blank\">CNR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.isciii.es\"
      target=\"_blank\">Instituto de Salud Carlos III</a>, national academies of sciences,
      etc). </p><p>In Figure 2, we study the mobility of researchers affiliated with
      universities covered by the Leiden Ranking, while also considering their mobility
      events with any other institution identified in GRID. This means that mobile
      researches are not only those that have been affiliated with more than one Leiden
      Ranking university, but also with any other organization identified by GRID.
      This includes, for instance, government research organizations, umbrella research
      organizations and their subsidiaries, as well as hospitals.</p><figure style=\"border:none;\"><iframe

      target=\"_blank\">Explore Tableau version in a new tab</a></figcaption><p></p><p>Overall,
      the general trends observed in Figure 2 remain the same as in Figure 1. However,
      this time we see a stronger propensity of mobility particularly in French and
      Italian universities that may be related to the important role of national research
      organizations such as CNRS (France) and CNR (Italy) in structuring and developing
      those countries' scientific occupations. Hence, one needs to keep the impact
      of these organizations in mind when analyzing differences in mobility patterns
      between individual countries, but the broad geographical patterns are robust
      to this bias.</p><h3>Expanding mobility analytics</h3><p>The devil is in the
      detail. While the previously outlined methodology is simple to calculate and
      understand, it may be challenging to interpret in the light of more refined
      and detailed mobility concepts, like migration, brain drain, etc., which have
      more relevance from a policy-motivated point of view. For example, the indicators
      above may confound cases in which a given researcher is marked as mobile because
      she simultaneously keeps multiple affiliations, or because she moved towards
      new opportunities in a different institution. The short timeframe of analysis
      may also be limiting. Policy-motivated research will require more directed and
      focused indicators.</p><p>That\u2019s why we also want to offer a quick look
      at what we could see as a potential indicator of <em>inbreeding</em>. This indicator
      is motivated by the previous study <a href=\"https://idea.cerge-ei.cz/files/RecruitingResearchers/\"
      target=\"_blank\">\"Where do universities recruit researchers from?\"</a> Assuming
      that researchers most likely publish their first paper(s) with affiliation to
      their Ph.D institution, this indicator aims at measuring the tendency of universities
      to keep their own Ph.D graduates affiliated to them over time. We first identify
      researchers who published with any given Leiden Ranking university in 2018 and
      collect their full publication history (as in Dimensions). We excluded academically
      younger researchers by removing all researchers with the first publication after
      2012, thus retaining only those researchers who started to publish in or before
      2012. Then we classified researchers into two types:</p><ul><li><em>Insiders</em>:
      Researchers whose first affiliation and their affiliation in 2018 remain the
      same.</li><li><em>Outsiders</em>: Researchers whose first affiliation and their
      affiliation in 2018 are different (i.e. in 2018 they are in a different institution
      than when they started to publish).</li></ul><p></p><figure style=\"border:none;\"><iframe

      spellcheck=\"false\">Figure 3. Inbreeding mobility patterns of Leiden Ranking
      universities. The size of circles represents the number of scholars with at
      least one publication affiliated with a Leiden Ranking university in 2018. The
      color represents the share of insiders. Universities in red are those with more
      than 50% of insiders, while blue indicates a larger share of outsiders. <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/rodrigo4482#!/vizhome/Dashboard_LR_inbreeding/Insiders_LR_Univ_insiders_explore\"
      target=\"_blank\">Explore Tableau version in a new tab</a></figcaption><p></p><p>Interestingly,
      Figure 3 exhibits a very similar pattern to those shown previously. While U.S.
      and Western European universities have (in 2018) researchers who more frequently
      started to publish in other universities, this is much less common in Eastern
      Europe or Southern Europe. For example, only 1 out of 4 researchers at Indiana
      University Bloomington started their publishing career at the same university.
      This figure is 3 out of 4 at Sapienza University in Rome or the University of
      Warsaw. Readers can study the data in more detail in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTFmN2I3ZjMtYTNiMC00MzdjLWIzYzMtYzIxZWY5YmY3ZjI0IiwidCI6ImJlMjhmNzFiLTM5MGUtNGQ3ZC1hOTQ4LTk0ZGM3ZGIwMmFlMyIsImMiOjh9\"

      and fields of research.</p><h3>The way forward</h3><p>The preliminary analysis
      presented in this blog post supports the possibility of monitoring and studying
      mobility patterns at the institutional level using bibliometrics. Many perspectives
      and alternative indicators can be formulated to fully understand global mobility
      patterns. Issues related to the economic, social, <a href=\"http://dakotamurray.me/posters/2020_ic2s2_mobility_poster.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">reputational, linguistic</a>, geographical, generational,
      systemic, or political aspects of scientific mobility (e.g., youth and size
      of the different scientific systems, travel bans, war conflicts, or the effects
      of crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic, etc.) are all elements that need
      to be considered in future scientific mobility studies. Moreover, more advanced
      conceptual definitions of mobility (e.g. migrants vs. multiple affiliations,
      inbreeding, or brain drain/brain gain processes) are also necessary for more
      advanced policy-relevant studies of the different dynamics related to scientific
      mobility.</p><p>Finally, more technical issues such as the coverage, completeness,
      and accuracy of the Dimensions database and of the GRID identifier, or more
      conceptual aspects such as the importance of scientific mobility in creating
      new thematic flows across institutions will deserve our attention in the near
      future.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>V\xEDt

      the creators of Transpose and the Platform for Responsible Editorial Policies
      convened an online workshop on infrastructures that provide information on scholarly
      journals. In this blog post they look back at the workshop and discuss next
      steps.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>In
      most research fields, journals play a dominant role in the scholarly communication
      system. However, the availability of systematic information on the policies
      and practices of journals, for instance with respect to peer review and open
      access publishing, is surprisingly limited and scattered. Of course we have
      the journal impact factor, as well as a range of other citation-based journal
      metrics (e.g., CiteScore, SNIP, SJR, and Eigenfactor), but these metrics provide
      information only on one very specific aspect of a journal. As is widely recognized,
      there is a strong need for a wider range of information on journals (see for
      instance<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110255553\"> here</a> and<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-01643-3\">
      here</a>). Such information is for instance needed to facilitate responsible
      evaluation practices, to promote open access publishing, and to improve journal
      peer review.</p><p>Various infrastructures provide information on aspects of
      scholarly journals, for instance:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://doaj.org/\">Directory
      of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/\">SHERPA/RoMEO</a></li><li><a

      journal registers (e.g., in<a href=\"https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/\">
      Norway</a>)</li></ul><p>Even though this list of infrastructures (which is definitely
      not comprehensive) may look impressive at first sight, it in fact leaves much
      to be desired. There are at least three problems. First, many of the above-mentioned
      infrastructures provide information only for a limited number of journals or
      publishers. Much information is missing, and information may also be inaccurate
      or outdated. Second, there is little coordination between the various infrastructures.
      They all operate independently from each other, leading to a scattered landscape.
      Insiders may understand the unique information provided by each infrastructure,
      but most researchers, publishers, and funders are likely to get lost in the
      multitude of infrastructures and data sources. Third, for many of the above-mentioned
      infrastructures, the longer-term sustainability is unclear. Infrastructures
      are often run by small teams working with very limited resources.</p><p>In May
      2020, in our roles as the creators of <a href=\"https://transpose-publishing.github.io/\">Transpose</a>
      and <a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/\">PREP</a>, we convened an
      online workshop to discuss ways to address the above-mentioned problems, in
      particular by exploring possibilities for collaboration between the various
      infrastructures. About 35 participants attended the workshop, including representatives
      of infrastructure organizations (e.g. representatives of the above listed initiatives
      and members of COPE, CrossRef, etc.), scholarly publishers, and research funders.
      Representatives of six infrastructure initiatives (i.e., PREP, Transpose, the
      STM taxonomy working group, TOP Factor, DOAJ, and SHERPA/RoMEO) gave short presentations,
      explaining their mission and scope as well as their perspective on collaboration
      with other initiatives. This was followed by a break-out session in which the
      workshop participants had more in-depth discussions about possibilities for
      collaboration.</p><p>The workshop has shown that there are many promising ways
      in which the different infrastructures could work together. This ranges from
      the development of a standardized terminology to describe the activities of
      journals (building on the work of the<a href=\"https://www.stm-assoc.org/standards-technology/peer-review-taxonomy-project/\">
      STM taxonomy working group</a>), to the introduction of cross-links between
      the websites of the different infrastructures and, more ambitiously, to initiatives
      aimed at making the different infrastructures fully interoperable and perhaps
      even at setting up an integrated infrastructure. In practical terms, the outcome
      of the workshop has been to start working together on two immediate next steps:</p><ul><li><em>Comparing
      infrastructures</em>. To obtain a better understanding of the similarities and
      differences between the various infrastructures, we plan to perform a systematic
      comparison of the information provided by each of the infrastructures.</li><li><em>Shared
      terminology or taxonomy</em>. Different infrastructures use different terminologies,
      which may cause confusion and limit interoperability. To address this issue,
      we plan to work on the development of a shared terminology or taxonomy via the
      <a href=\"https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/\">Doc Maps project</a> led by
      the Knowledge Futures group.</li></ul><p>Depending on the availability of resources
      and the level of support from the community, these two steps will hopefully
      provide a starting point for a more ambitious long-term agenda, aimed at working
      toward some kind of integrated infrastructure for providing systematic and reliable
      information on scholarly journals. We hope to involve all relevant stakeholders
      in this endeavor. Let us know if you would like to join!</p><p></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Willem

      a new approach to research evaluation, which we call Evaluative Inquiry (EI).

      trajectories, and the EIs <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\">contextualization
      of research value</a>. This third post focuses on our methods for evaluating
      research.</p><p>Many in academic and professional environments have discussed
      and criticized the reliance on metrics and quantitative methods in research
      evaluation. The Leiden Manifesto, the Metric Tide, or DORA have offered careful
      considerations on how to measure and represent research value. The Evaluative
      Inquiry participates in this project using a portfolio of quantitative and qualitative
      methods that are used in complementary ways to make visible the complexity of
      academic research.</p><p>The Dutch evaluation protocol requires academic organizations
      to provide proof of use and recognition of academic and societal production.
      In many fields this distinction between the societal and the academic is artificial,
      which makes it difficult for scientific boards and managers to put together
      the self-evaluation document that is required by the evaluation committee. Mixing
      methods provides different pieces to this complex puzzle, allowing for a less
      dichotomized and more contextualized approached. </p><p>We have used bibliometric
      methodologies, using Web of Science, Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic,
      to get insight into co-authorship relations, citation scores and visibility
      in journals. As fields such as Anthropology and Theology often produce not only
      articles in journals but also books, monographs and edited volumes, we like
      working with <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article-abstract/25/3/264/2364634?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">Google Scholar as it allows us to trace the use of books</a>
      both in the academic domain as beyond. In addition to these analyses, we have
      used Ad Prins' <a href=\"https://adprins.nl/projecten/analyses-for-pbl-cpb-scp-zonmw-and-the-health-council/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Contextual Response Analysis</a>, which makes it possible
      to get a sense of the users and the patterns of use of the output of the particular
      research organization. The <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer</a>
      tool that CWTS developed makes it possible to map the discursive space that
      research organizations operate in, as well as changes over time. Other than
      these more quantitative methods, we have used interviews and focus group discussions
      to get a more fine-grained understanding of the organizational context as well
      as people\u2019s perceptions of the organization\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.
      These interviews and focus groups allow us to probe scholars about the relevance
      of their work for other social environments other than academia which is still
      their main focus. Our portfolio includes other advanced scientometric analytics
      that we will put to use in the future, such as the Strength, Potential and Risk
      analysis and the <a href=\"https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jdis/4/3/article-p6.xml\"
      target=\"_blank\">Area Based Connectedness</a> analysis.</p><p>The Evaluative
      Inquiry uses its methods in a complementary way. Doing Google Scholar analyses
      and user studies makes it possible to get a sense of the different elements
      of the academic value trajectory: the kind of output, reception, theoretical
      and topical developments and people\u2019s engagements and perceptions. The
      more qualitative interviews and focus groups facilitate the collection of organizational
      and contextual information, allowing us to situate these value trajectories
      in direct relation to the academic organizations and stakeholder networks that
      scholars work within. One method\u2019s insights can, moreover, corroborate
      or dispute claims of another. Theologians have for example claimed in interviews
      that their work reaches multiple audiences, while the user analysis and Google
      Scholar impressions showed a more homogeneous user group. Discussing these dissonances
      yielded important information about theologians' value trajectories.</p><p>An
      important part of our methodological strategy is to work closely with the academic
      institute, provide regular updates of our analyses, and allow for questions
      and input. In the project with the humanists we, moreover, invited them to actively
      contribute to the analyses. An example of this is the user analysis we did for
      the University for Humanistic Studies. When we presented preliminary results,
      the scientific board commented on our classification of topics that users expressed
      interest in. We therefore invited them to do the labelling themselves, involving
      them in the nitty-gritty of our analysis and classification process. Allowing
      them into the kitchen of our analyses not only improved their understanding
      of the user analysis but also created ownership of the results. We achieved
      a similar effect with the workshop we have organized towards the end of the
      project. We invited the whole academic organization for this event where we
      shared our preliminary findings and gave everyone the opportunity to weigh in
      and fine-tune our results. </p><p>A portfolio of quantitative and qualitative
      methods provides complementary insights. Metrics can give powerful insights
      into collaboration patterns, disciplinary orientation and relevant audiences
      but they are insufficient to understand and represent value and relevance in
      context; qualitative insights are needed as well. The Evaluative Inquiry uses
      methods in a versatile and complementary way. This entails a letting go of believing
      in one method getting it right and being capable of providing the most accurate
      representation of academic work. We argue, instead, that a multiplication of
      methods and close collaboration with clients allow for more interesting insights
      into academic realities. This approach, lastly, fits the requirements of the
      new Dutch Strategic Evaluation Approach (<a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">SEP</a>) 2021 -2027, which calls for a narrative focus of
      the self-evaluation document. </p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Tjitske

      variety of \u2018mappings\u2019 of research on SDGs are being developed. A recent
      study shows that there are stark disagreements across some of these bibliometric
      \u2018mappings\u2019, raising concerns about their robustness. I argue here
      that this is due to different interpretations of the science relevant to SDGs.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <h3>The
      shift in R&D goals towards the SDGs is driving demand for new S&T indicators\u2026</h3><p>The
      shift in Science & Technology policy from a focus on research quality (or \u2018excellence\u2019)
      towards societal impact has led to a demand for <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/report.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">new Science & Technology indicators</a> that capture the contributions
      of research to society, in particular those aligned with SDGs. The use of the
      new \u2018impact\u2019 indicators would help monitoring if (and which) research
      organisations are aligning their research towards certain SDGs.</p><p>Responding
      to these demands data providers, consultancies and university analysts are rapidly
      developing methods to map projects or publications related to specific SDGs.
      These \u2018mappings\u2019 do not analyse the actual impact of research, but
      hope to capture instead if research is directed towards problems or technologies
      that can potentially contribute to improving sustainability and wellbeing.</p><h3>\u2026but
      indicators on the contributions of science on the SDGs are not (yet) robust</h3><p>Yet
      this quick surge of news methods raises new questions about the robustness of
      the mappings and indicators produced, and old questions about the effects of
      using questionable indicators in policy making. The misuse of indicators and
      rankings in research evaluation has been one of the key debates in science policy
      this last decade, as highlighted by initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)</a>,
      the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/bibliometrics-the-leiden-manifesto-for-research-metrics-1.17351\">Leiden
      Manifesto</a> or <a href=\"https://responsiblemetrics.org/the-metric-tide/\"><em>The
      Metric Tide</em></a> report in the UK context. </p><p>Indeed, the first publicly
      available analysis of SDG impact, released recently by the <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2019/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Times Higher Education</em></a> (THE), should be a motive
      for serious alarm. For almost two decades, the THE has offered a controversial
      ranking of universities according to \u2018excellence\u2019. This last May it
      has produced a new ranking of universities according to an equally questionable
      composite indicator that arbitrarily adds up dimensions of unclear relevance.
      For example, the<a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2019/good-health-and-well-being#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/undefined\"
      target=\"_blank\"> indicator of the impact on health</a> (SDG3) of a university
      depends on the one hand on its relative specialisation on health \u2013 as captured,
      e.g. by the proportion of papers related to health (10% of total weight), and
      on the other hand on the proportion of health graduates (34.6%). But the weight
      is also based on (self-reported) university policies such as care provided by
      the university, e.g. free sexual and reproductive health services for students
      (8.6%) or community access to sports facilities (4%). This indicator is likely
      to cause more confusion than clarity and it is potentially harmful as it mystifies
      university policies for the SDGs. </p><p>The relative specialisation on health
      captured by the proportion of papers related to health in the THE ranking is
      partly supported by an <a href=\"https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1\"
      target=\"_blank\">Elsevier analysis</a> of the publications that are related
      to the SDGs \u2013 which might seem more reliable than those based on data self-reported
      by universities.</p><p>However, mapping publications to the SDGs is not as straightforward
      as it might seem. An article published last month by a team at the University
      of Bergen (<a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qss_a_00071\"
      target=\"_blank\">see Armitage et al., 2020</a>) sounded the alarm by showing
      that slightly different methods may produce extremely different results. When
      comparing the papers related to SDGs retrieved with their own analysis with
      those by Elsevier, they found that there is astonishingly little overlap \u2013
      in most SDGs only around 20-30% as illustrated in Figure 1. The differences
      also  affected the rankings of countries\u2019 contributions to the SDGs. The
      <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qss_a_00071\" target=\"_blank\">Bergen
      team</a> concluded that \u2018currently available SDG rankings and tools should
      be used with caution at their current stage of development.\u2019<br></p><div

      target=\"_blank\"><em>Armitage et al. (2020)</em></a><em></em></span></p><h3>Why
      are mappings of publications to SDGs so different? Lack of direct relation between
      science and SDGs</h3><p>Perhaps we should not be surprised that different methods
      yield so different results. The SDGs refer to policy goals about sustainability
      in multiple dimensions \u2013 ending poverty, improving health, achieving gender
      equality, preserving the natural environment, etcetera. Science and innovation
      studies have shown that the contributions of research to societies <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/4681029a\"
      target=\"_blank\">are often unexpected</a>\r\nand highly dependent on the <a
      href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/097172180601200101?journalCode=stsa\"
      target=\"_blank\">local social contexts</a> in which knowledges are created
      and used.</p><p>Nevertheless, most research is funded according to the expectations
      of the type of societal benefits that it may generate \u2013 and thus one can
      try to map these expectations or promises according to the language used in
      the (titles and abstracts of) projects and  articles. Unfortunately, the expected
      social contributions are often not made explicit in these technical documents
      because the experts reading them are assumed to see the potential value.</p><p>As
      a consequence, the process of mapping projects or articles to the SDGs is ineluctably
      carried out through an interpretative process that \u2018translates\u2019 (or
      attempts to link) scientific discourse into potential outcomes. Of course, such
      translation is dependent on the analysts\u2019 understandings of science and
      the SDGs. There is consensus on some of these understandings. For example most
      analysts would agree that research on malaria is important for achieving global
      health. However, other translations are highly contested: should nuclear (either
      fission or fusion) research be seen as a contribution to clean and affordable
      energy? Should all educational research be counted as contribution to the SDG
      on \u2018quality education\u2019?</p><p>Furthermore, in a number of SDGs such
      as gender equity (SDG 5) or reduced inequalities (SDG 10), there is a lot of
      ambiguity on the potential contributions. In particular, there is relatively
      little research specifically on these issues in comparison to the research with
      outcomes affecting gender relations and inequalities. </p><p>Another challenge
      of these mappings is that the databases used for analysis are not comprehensive,
      having a much larger coverage of certain fields and countries (<a href=\"http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/\"
      target=\"_blank\">See Chapter 5 in Chavarro, 2017</a>). This is particularly
      problematic when analysing research of the Global South.</p><p>In summary, there
      are many societal problems where there is lack of consensus and ambiguities,
      and in these cases, the mappings will depend on the particular interpretation
      of the SDGs that the mapping methods implicitly adopt.</p><h3>A plurality of
      SDG mapping methodologies</h3><p>It follows from the previous discussion that
      different analyses carry out different \u2018translations\u2019 of the SDGs
      into science through the choice of different methodologies. The <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/article/sustainable-development-goals-mapping-the-research-landscape/\"
      target=\"_blank\">study by Clarivate</a> (2019) is based on a core set of articles
      that mention \u2018Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 \u2013 thus it is related
      to research areas with an explicit SDG discourse. </p><p>The approaches developed
      by <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qss_a_00071\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bergen University</a>, <a href=\"https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1\"
      target=\"_blank\">Elsevier</a>, the <a href=\"https://aurora-network.global/project/sdg-analysis-bibliometrics-relevance/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Aurora Network</a> and <a href=\"http://science4sdgs.sirisacademic.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">SIRIS Academic</a> are based on searching for strings of keywords,
      in particular keywords found in the UN SDGs targets or other relevant policy
      documents. These searches are then enriched differently in each case. The hypothesis
      of this \u2018translation\u2019 is that publications or projects containing
      these keywords are those best aligned with the UN SDG discourse. The question
      is then where should the line be drawn. For example, why in some lists zika
      virus is included in the list of health SDG3, but not the closely related dengue
      virus, with a much higher disease burden? </p><p>An alternative approach being
      developed at NESTA and <a href=\"https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/Contextualising_Sustainable_Development_Research/12200081\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a> uses policy documents and keywords to train
      machine learning algorithms in order to identify articles related to the SDGs
      instead of creating a list of keywords to search the articles. The downside
      of this approach is that it is a black box regarding the preferences (or biases)
      of the machine learning algorithms.</p><h3>Comparisons as a pragmatic way forward
      </h3><p>In the face of this plurality of approaches potentially yielding disparate
      results, <a href=\"http://strings.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">the STRINGS project
      </a>aims to be a space for constructive discussion and comparison across different
      methodologies. A comparison between methods will help in finding out to which
      extent there is consensus or dissensus in the mappings of various SDGs. </p><p>To
      this purpose, in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.sussex.ac.uk/discus/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Data Intensive Science Centre at the University of Sussex
      (DISCUS)</a>, on July 23-27 we have carried out a hackathon focussed on retrieving
      publications related to clean energy research (SDG 7) (to be reported). We have
      also organised a workshop to discuss the results obtained by the different teams
      mentioned above with the various methodologies, and how each methodology might
      capture a particular \u2018translation\u2019 or understanding of the SDGs. As
      proposed by the <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qss_a_00071\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bergen team</a>, this comparison \u2018will allow institutions
      to compare different approaches, better understand where rankings come from,
      and evaluate how well a specific tool might work\u2019 for specific contexts
      and purposes. </p><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>The discussion in this blog builds on

      summer season, we are publishing a series of book reviews. This time, our colleague
      Juan shares with us a book that is very close to his heart, and which had an
      influence on how he sees the idea of work.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>I would like to tell you
      about a book that changed my life, but I don\u2019t want to spoil it yet by
      revealing the title. You see, since I was young, I had always anguished about
      career choices. I imagined that I would be forced to put hours into something
      I hate, and I would arrive home after work hating myself too. My family and
      my school imposed on me this idea that work is suffering, and suffering is good,
      and if you don\u2019t like suffering then you don\u2019t deserve good things.
      How cheerful. Happily, I had some pieces of common sense in my brain, so I rejected
      this idea, but I also thought: so, this is what most people think about work,
      I better be careful in choosing my job or else I'll get suffocated!</p><p>And
      so, I lived my life questioning what kind of job I would <em>really</em> like.
      People told me that if I followed my passion, I would never have to work in
      my life. Such a pressure! That is, until I found this wonderful book. This book
      proposes that the idea that you are born with a passion that destines you to
      a dream job is a lie, and a quite harmful one! In reality, most people that
      are happy at their job acquire a taste for their job over time. The more years
      they spend doing their job, the more they start to like it. </p><p>Now I know
      what you are thinking: \"But what about this and that job. They are horrible!\"
      Well, luckily, this book has got you covered. There are three conditions that
      a job requires to make you happy, and jobs without these conditions will never
      make you happy. These conditions are:</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy: </strong>You
      need to feel some sense of control over what you do with your time. If your
      job requires you to behave like a machine without initiative, then you are bound
      to feel as such. Interestingly, autonomy is also considered a critical factor
      for happiness by <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/bouncing-back/201106/the-no-1-contributor-happiness\"
      target=\"_blank\">psychologists</a>!<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Competence:</strong>
      You need to feel that you are getting better at what you do. Trivial jobs rot
      your brain and do not allow you to feel pride in your skills, while difficult
      and unmanageable jobs make you feel humiliated and stupid.</li><li><strong>Relatedness:
      </strong>You need to feel that you are connecting with people at your job. This
      could be either with your colleagues, your clients, or by helping people as
      a consequence of your job. Nobody likes to work with people they hate, and nobody
      profits from causing others to suffer (I hope!).</li></ul><p>You may also be
      thinking:&nbsp;\"Well, not everybody is looking to be happy at their work; some
      people only want the money.\" If you are thinking that, then the book also addresses
      that issue (and if you are not thinking that then, well, you should). The book
      cites <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/faculty/amy-wrzesniewski\" target=\"_blank\">Amy
      Wrzesniewski</a>, who argues that there are three contexts for your work:</p><ul><li><strong>Job:
      </strong>You work for the money.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Career:</strong>
      You work to get a better job.</li><li><strong>Calling: </strong>You work because
      it defines who you are.</li></ul><p>I would argue that for most people their
      work is a job, especially for those unfortunately enough to not have the power
      to choose which job they want. These categories are not very relevant to the
      point I am making, but I still wanted to show them to you because they might
      be helpful, somehow.</p><p>Anyhow, going back to my point, after reading the
      book I realized that life at work can actually be wonderful, and that I don\u2019t
      need to fear landing in a bad job if I know how to look for a better one. The
      book\u2019s title is <em>So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You</em>, written by
      Cal Newport, and in this post I have only reviewed the part that touched me

      \u2014 why did you pursue a career in science?\u201D, I\u2019m not sure that
      I could give you a good answer. Maybe it had something to do with the whole
      being \u201Ccurious about the nature of reality\u201D thing. Maybe it\u2019s
      because I\u2019m stubborn and argumentative, and I thought that academic science
      rewarded these traits. Or maybe I just liked the independence \u2014 the chance
      to study whatever I wanted and <em>actually</em><em>get paid for it</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I
      can, however, think of one thing that definitely <em>wasn\u2019t</em> a reason
      for getting into science: writing up my research in the sexiest way possible,
      submitting it to high-impact journals, and hoping to convince some editor to
      publish it and validate my sense of self-worth (and slightly increase my chances
      of getting a grant or permanent position some day).&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, my memory
      isn\u2019t great, but I\u2019m pretty sure that wasn\u2019t part of the equation.&nbsp;</p><p>The
      reality is that many of us are idealistic when we get into science. Then, little
      by little, we learn the rules of the game. We learn that certain types of results,
      such as those that are novel and statistically significant, are valued more
      than others. We learn that scientists prefer clean, compelling narratives over
      honest descriptions of mixed findings and protocol failures. And we learn that
      our scientific worth is determined by whether we publish in certain journals,
      such as those with a high impact-factor.</p><p>Once we learn the rules, we begin
      to play (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/i-quit-be062295f638\" target=\"_blank\">or
      we just get fed up and leave</a>\u200A). After all, nobody likes to lose, even
      if it\u2019s just a game.&nbsp;</p><p>In this post, I\u2019d like to focus on
      one game that scientists play: writing up and submitting papers for publication.
      I\u2019ll try to convince you that, given the way this game is set up, scientists
      are incentivized to deceive journals about the quality of their work.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ll
      also try to convince you that all hope is not lost. Even if we accept that scientists
      \u201Cplay the game\u201D, we can change the rules to promote a more \u201Chonest\u201D
      publishing system. Along the way, we\u2019ll learn a bit of signaling theory,
      and I\u2019ll even throw in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a>
      reference or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Academic journals are vulnerable
      to deception.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Why? Well, there are two interrelated reasons.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>There
      are information asymmetries between scientists and journals.&nbsp;</li><li>There
      are conflicts of interest between scientists and journals.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Scientists
      know every little detail about their research \u2014 how many experiments they
      ran, how many dependent variables they measured, all the ways they analyzed
      their data, how their hypotheses changed throughout the research process, etc.
      But a journal only sees the final paper. So, there\u2019s an information asymmetry
      - scientists have more information about some aspects of their work (for example,
      things related to its \u201Cquality\u201D) than do journals.&nbsp;</p><p>All
      else equal, scientists have incentives to publish each paper in the highest-ranking
      journal possible (even if a paper isn\u2019t very good). But high-ranking journals
      don\u2019t want to publish every paper \u2014 they want a subset of papers that
      meet their publication criteria. These might be papers with compelling evidence,
      novel results, important theoretical contributions, or whatever. This creates
      a conflict of interest, in the game-theoretic sense \u2014 a scientist may benefit
      by getting a methodologically sloppy, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106\"><em>p-hacked</em></a>
      paper published in a high-ranking journal, but the high-ranking journal would
      prefer not to publish this paper (all else equal).&nbsp;</p><p>These factors
      make journals vulnerable to deception. This vulnerability exists along <em>any
      </em>dimension where there are information asymmetries and conflicts of interest.
      Let\u2019s focus on research \u201Cquality\u201D for now, because that\u2019s
      a case where the information asymmetries and conflicts of interest are clear
      (see Simine Vazire\u2019s nice <a href=\"https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.74/\">paper</a>
      about this in the context of quality uncertainty and trust in science).&nbsp;</p><p
      style=\"padding-left: 5%;\">Aside: I\u2019m going to use a behavioral definition
      of deception \u2014 an act that transmits information that doesn\u2019t accurately
      (i.e., honestly) represent some underlying state (and was designed to do so).
      This sidesteps the whole \u201Cis it conscious or not\u201D business. It also
      gets closer to how biologists think of \u201Cdeceptive signals\u201D, which
      will become relevant later.</p><p>Why should we care if scientists attempt to
      \u201Cdeceive\u201D journals by submitting low-quality work to high-ranking
      journals? At least 3 reasons.&nbsp;</p><ol><li> It wastes editors\u2019 and
      reviewers\u2019 time.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/peer-reviewed-scientific-journals-dont-really-do-their-job/\">Peer
      review sucks</a>. So, low-quality papers \u201Cslip through the cracks\u201D
      and onto the pages of high-ranking journals (it\u2019s trivially easy to find
      <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-controversial-hydroxychloroquine-study/\">example</a>
      after <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/18/authors-of-article-on-iq-religiosity-and-crime-retract-it-to-do-a-level-of-vetting-we-should-have-done-before-submitting/\">example</a>
      after <a href=\"https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/9zbcw/providers/osfstorage/5c6ea0248d5d98001a337423?pid=9zbcw&direct&public_file=True&version=1&mode=render&action=download\">example</a>
      of this). This lowers any correlation between journal rank and research quality,
      which isn\u2019t ideal because, for better or worse, scientists use journal
      rank as a proxy for \u201Cquality\u201D (hint: it\u2019s worse).&nbsp;</li><li>
      If low-quality research takes less time than high-quality research but still
      gets published in high-ranking journals, then scientists have less incentive
      to do high-quality work. This can generate<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection\">
      adverse selection</a>: high-quality work is driven out of the market, until
      low-quality garbage is all that remains (you can also think of the related \u201C<a
      href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160384\">Natural
      Selection of Bad Science</a><em>\u201D</em>, where low-quality science spreads
      even if scientists don\u2019t strategically adjust their methods).&nbsp;<p></p></li></ol><p>So,
      it\u2019d be nice if we could solve this problem somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</p><div

      course, deception isn\u2019t unique to academic publishing \u2014 whenever there
      are information asymmetries and conflicts of interest, there are incentives
      to deceive.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider a biological example. A mama bird brings food
      back to her nest and must decide which chick to feed. Mama prefers to feed the
      hungriest chick and so benefits from knowing how much food each chick needs.
      But each chick may want the food for itself. So, even though Mama would benefit
      if the chicks honestly communicated their level of hunger, each chick may benefit
      by deceiving Mama and claiming to be the hungriest.&nbsp;</p><p>How can honest
      communication exist when there are incentives for deception? Why don\u2019t
      communication systems just become filled with lies and break down?</p><p>It
      turns out that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)\">economists</a>
      and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory\">biologists</a>
      have been interested in this question for a long time. And so, there\u2019s
      a body of formal theory \u2014 Signaling Theory \u2014 dedicated to this and
      related problems (I\u2019m more familiar with biological signaling theory, so
      I\u2019ll focus on that).</p><p>This is good news.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Because
      it means that signaling theory can potentially provide us with \u201Ctools for
      thinking\u201D about how to deal with deception in academic publishing.</p><p><strong>Who
      you gonna call? Signaling theory!</strong></p><p>I tried \xAF\\_(:/)_/\xAF</p><p>One
      insight from signaling theory is that \u201Chonest signaling\u201D is possible
      if the costs or benefits of producing a signal are different for different \u201Ctypes\u201D
      of individuals. Think back to Mama bird and her chicks. Imagine that there are
      two types of chicks \u2014 starving and kinda-hungry. Both chicks benefit from
      getting food. But the benefit is larger for the starving chick, because it needs
      the food more.&nbsp;</p><p>If signaling (e.g., loudly begging Mama bird for
      food) has no cost, then none of this matters - both chicks will signal because
      they benefit from the food. But what if the signal is <em>costly</em>? Then,
      a chick will only signal if the benefits of getting the food outweigh the cost
      of the signal. This is where it gets interesting. Because the starving chick
      <em>benefits more</em> from the food than the kinda-hungry chick, if a signal
      is costly enough, then it\u2019s only worth paying this cost if a chick is truly
      starving. So, in a world of magical payoff-maximizing chicks and where begging
      is just costly enough, only the starving chicks would be doing the begging.&nbsp;</p><p>Boom
      \u2014 honest signaling.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what\u2019s known as a situation
      of <em>differential benefits</em> \u2014 both chicks pay the same cost when
      begging, but receive different payoffs from getting fed. Another way to get
      honest signaling is via <em>differential costs</em>. The idea is similar, except
      that different types pay different costs for the same signal. For example, maybe
      a good skateboarder can get away with doing a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy1vuubPhDs\">roof
      drop</a> to show how cool they are, but a bad skateboarder would break their
      legs. The key is that producing a signal must only be worth it for some types
      of individuals (there are also other ways to get honest signaling that I won\u2019t
      get into here - check out (<a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books/about/Animal_Signals.html?id=SUA51MeG1lcC&redir_esc=y\">1</a>)
      and (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210003374?casa_token=Y7akJrSJRPgAAAAA:NpX5y5fM8c0mJWj4pSqVQQoWMBs4E5WAzi4f1J-oqwiIH56JdZUah1c90pb9UMCOCpa5t3zdKA\">2</a>)
      if interested).&nbsp;</p><p>Now let\u2019s apply these insights to academic
      publishing. Say that we want a system where scientists don\u2019t submit every
      paper to high-ranking journals, thinking that they might as well \u201Cgive
      it a shot\u201D. Instead, say that we want scientists to \u201Chonestly\u201D
      submit high-quality papers to high-ranking journals and low-quality papers to
      low-ranking journals. What reforms would move us towards this outcome?</p><p>My
      co-authors and I go through a bunch of these in our paper. Here, I\u2019ll list
      a few that I think are most interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Publishing inefficiencies
      serve a function.</strong></p><p>We often complain about publishing inefficiencies,
      like long review times, arbitrary formatting requirements, and high financial
      costs to publication. But, as the signaling example shows, inefficiencies can
      serve a function: the costs associated with publishing reduce the incentive
      to submit low-quality research to high-ranking journals. Economists have known
      this for a long time (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1805232.pdf?casa_token=uvdXdVOngvMAAAAA:_elKUoe0LwvIERwYxI672HsCqkaUwBMef0yAE_KeSogciQgBFNRkVxA2_3OBTLF_yl-VNDAtOiK5rKu4qN98cEeOxQm1GXfORcNLfEJ-UKImhBdDXfU\">1</a>,
      <a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/212135611/fulltextPDF/3389D831CD86461EPQ/1?accountid=27128\">2</a>).
      Just think of what would happen if <em>Nature </em>and <em>Science</em> made
      their submission process as low-cost as possible (e.g., no submission costs,
      formatting requirements, or cover letters; guaranteed reviews within 48 hours).
      They\u2019d get flooded with (even more) shitty submissions.&nbsp;</p><p>The
      point isn\u2019t that inefficiencies are \u201Cgood for science\u201D. It\u2019s
      that we should keep in mind that removing inefficiencies will create collateral
      damage, and we need to weigh this damage against the benefits of a more efficient
      publishing system. I see a lot of room for work on this and related problems:
      what functions do inefficiencies serve and how can we optimally structure inefficiencies
      to generate the best outcomes for science?</p><p><strong>Creating differential
      benefits.</strong></p><p>For differential benefits, the key is to create a system
      where there are larger benefits for submitting or publishing high-quality versus
      low-quality papers in high-ranking journals.&nbsp;</p><p>Some ways to do this
      are intuitive. We can improve peer-review (which makes it easier to tell good
      work from bad). We can mandate transparent research practices (same function).&nbsp;</p><p>Another
      idea is to r<em>educe the benefits associated with publishing low-quality work
      in high-ranking journals</em>. I see a few potential approaches here. We could
      target high-ranking publications for direct replication or preferentially scrutinize
      them for questionable research practices, statistical/mathematical errors, and
      problems with study design. This would be a post-publication differential benefits
      approach. Then, we would need to make sure that scientists receive lower benefits
      for publishing bad work in high-ranking journals. Possibilities include financial
      penalties, fewer citations for the published paper, or reputational damage (maybe
      the journal refuses to accept the scientist\u2019s future submissions for some
      amount of time, or maybe other journals raise their bar for publishing that
      scientist\u2019s future papers).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Creating differential costs.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For
      differential costs, the key is to create a system where there are larger costs
      for submitting or publishing low-quality versus high-quality papers in high-ranking
      journals.&nbsp;</p><p>One way to do this is to create <em>costs to resubmission</em>.
      When submission and resubmission is cheap and easy, scientists are incentivized
      to submit all papers to high-ranking journals, because scientists don\u2019t
      lose anything when they get rejected. Resubmission costs solve this problem
      by making rejection costly. <em>If </em>low-quality submissions are more likely
      to be rejected, then resubmission costs will work. Of course, this would be
      another inefficiency in the publication process, which is something we\u2019d
      need to take into account.&nbsp;</p><p>If we wanted to go this route, there
      are a few possibilities. Editors could wait some time before sending \u201Creject\u201D
      decisions. This would cause disproportionate delays for low-quality submissions.
      If papers had pre-publication DOI\u2019s and their submission histories could
      be tracked, journals could refuse to evaluate papers that had been resubmitted
      too quickly. Or authors could \u201Cpay\u201D for submissions by having to peer
      review <em>N</em> other papers for each submission.&nbsp;</p><p>Something else
      that could work would be to make peer-review and editorial decisions openly
      available, <em>even for rejected papers</em>. I like this idea (though it does
      have some issues, like generating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade\">information
      cascades</a>). One nice thing is that making peer-review and editorial decisions
      openly available would mean that less information gets lost throughout the submission
      process (because prior reviews don\u2019t just disappear into the darkness).
      And if low-quality papers receive more negative reviews, on average, then scientists
      will have fewer incentives to \u201Ctry out\u201D submitting to a high-impact
      journal, because negative reviews would follow the paper to future journals
      (and would eventually be seen by readers).&nbsp;</p><p>Other ways to increase
      differential costs could be to target the submission process. For example, authors
      could pay a submission fee (<a href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/212135611/fulltextPDF/121B9083E7114F14PQ/1?accountid=27128\">as
      is the case for some journals in Economics, Accounting, and Finance</a>) but
      get refunded if the paper is deemed to be sufficiently high quality. This could
      even be incremental \u2014 bigger fees when there\u2019s a bigger difference
      between the journal\u2019s minimum standards and the quality of the submission.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Limiting
      the number of submissions (or rejections) per paper.&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>This
      will also work (but because it creates opportunity costs). I\u2019ll discuss
      this idea in more detail in a future post. If you\u2019re interested, check
      out the paper, which goes into more detail.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Epic inspiring
      ending.&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>This is where I\u2019m supposed to bring
      everything together, throw in an inspirational quote, and make a final Ghostbusters
      reference, to make you think, \u201Cwell isn\u2019t he clever.\u201D Must. Validate.
      Sense. Of. Self. Worth.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, a few thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m
      not really a fan of the current publishing system, using journal rank as a proxy
      for quality, publishing inefficiencies, and so on. I hate the game, and resent
      the fact that I need to play it to have a successful academic career. I\u2019m
      open to overhauling the system completely (e.g., getting rid of journals) if
      we get solid evidence that this would be better. But we\u2019re not quite there
      yet. For now, we\u2019re stuck. Journals and rankings. Information asymmetries.
      Conflicts of interests. So <em>if</em> we\u2019re going to play this game, then
      we should consider how we can change the rules to produce better outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>As
      we think about changing these rules, we could do worse than to add \u201Cdifferential
      costs\u201D and \u201Cdifferential benefits\u201D to our conceptual toolkits.
      These ideas have proven their worth in biology, and will likely be of use to
      us, even outside the context of academic publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to prevent
      scientists from submitting grant applications when their ideas are bad or infeasible?
      Make grant submission more costly for bad proposals. John Ioannidis suggested
      a version of this with the \u201Cprovocative\u201D idea that grants be \u201C<a
      href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001747\">...considered

      Producing good-quality science is harder if your proposal was bad or infeasible.
      Boom \u2014 differential costs. Alternatively, as suggested for academic publishing,
      there could be submission fees that are refunded if a grant proposal meets some
      quality threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should keep in mind that many of the
      ideas here could exacerbate inequalities between individuals with more or less
      resources, such as early-career researchers and scientists in developing countries.
      This is a concern (though there are solutions, such as making submission costs
      conditional on scientists\u2019 ability to pay them). The paper discusses this
      a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we should keep our eyes open for what we can learn
      from other disciplines. The fact that signaling theory is useful for thinking
      about academic publishing is just the tip of the iceberg. As one example, while
      working on our paper, my co-authors and I discovered a huge literature in economics
      that addresses these same problems (and where people have come to many of the
      same conclusions about how to improve academic publishing). We review some of
      this work in the paper. For a nice, non-mathy introduction, check out this <a
      href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/200674809/fulltextPDF/AC45BD0720A04F14PQ/1?accountid=27128\">paper</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So,
      what now?</p><p>You could read our paper. That\u2019s an ok start. You could
      give me and my co-authors all of your money, so that we can figure out how to
      make publishing more efficient and reliable. That benefits us, but probably
      isn\u2019t in your best interest. You could immerse yourself in the literature
      on signaling in biology and publishing reform in economics. That may or may
      not be useful for you though, and it\u2019s pretty costly.&nbsp;</p><p>I think

      know that academic knowledge production happens in context, yet, when assessing
      research, we undervalue the influence of stakeholders and organizational contexts
      on academic output and impact. The second of four blogposts is on evaluating
      research in context.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>In
      a series of blog posts, we want to introduce the four principles of a new CWTS
      approach to research evaluation. Since 2017 we have been developing this approach
      in the context of several projects mainly assisting others with putting together
      the self-evaluation document of the Standard Evaluation Protocol. On the basis
      of these experiences, and most notably the projects with the Protestant Theological
      University and with the University for Humanistics, we want to describe the
      four underpinnings of this Evaluative Inquiry: open-ended concept of research
      value; contextualization; mixed-method approach; and a focus on both accounting
      and learning. This second post focuses on contextualizing value.</p><p><a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-i-academic-value-is-more-than-performance\">The
      previous post</a> was about how the Evaluative Inquiry doesn\u2019t follow a
      predetermined understanding of value as performance metrics but investigates
      value as a quality that comes into being in trajectories from research ambitions
      and organization to reception and use in the larger world. This post focuses
      on the two contexts of these trajectories, the research organization and the
      user and stakeholder context. </p><p>To start with the latter, when societal
      relevance was added to the evaluation protocols in the Netherlands and United
      Kingdom, a rather uniform concept of stakeholders developed in the science policy
      community as societal recipients of the benefits of fundamental research and
      secondary audiences of the scientific output. Even if this group was very diverse,
      from teachers to transportation companies, to the elderly or provincial governments,
      the relation of these stakeholders to academic work was as relatively passive
      recipients. Our experiences with the theologians and humanists present a different
      picture. Theologians and humanistic scholars working on, for example, spiritual
      care work closely together with practitioners, policy makers or caregivers in
      the field of spiritual care. Their work addresses questions that stem from professional,
      policy or academic environments such as moral injury or distress and it is taken
      up both in professional circles (professional handbooks or policy guidelines
      for example) and in academic audiences (papers on the spiritual in care). The
      distinctions between scientific production and societal use become blurry.</p><p>The
      fundamental point here is that at every stage of the knowledge trajectory, from
      question to answer, from production to communication and reception, from input
      to output, the scholarly and societal are closely intertwined. What do these
      collaborations look like, how do these result in particular kinds of output,
      and how can these collaborations be made visible in evaluative projects? The
      Evaluative Inquiry aspires to making visible these \u201C<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article-abstract/20/3/211/1560312\">productive
      interactions</a>\u201D within a shared problem space and their particular versions
      of relevance, excellence, or expertise. As such it builds on other attempts
      such as the <a href=\"https://www.qrih.nl/en\">Quality and Relevance in the
      Humanities</a> system, developed for research evaluation in the humanities,
      which seeks to broaden the ranges of outputs, use and recognition.</p><p>Thinking
      of value pathways that integrate the societal and the scholarly, and knowledge
      production and communication and reception, brings into view the academic organization
      as a crucial context as well. Research evaluation is often concerned with use,
      reception and impact of academic knowledge considering the organization of the
      knowledge production, \u201Cits viability,\u201D as an afterthought to research
      value. We contend that the organization of the knowledge production process
      is crucial for understanding what knowledge is being produced and to what effect.
      </p><p>There are many variables to this organizational context that matter to
      the specific output, relevance and reception. Organizational histories, publication
      cultures, teaching versus research obligations, funding sources and epistemic
      cultures all influence the processes and practices of academic research. Research
      organizations often bring together (sub)disciplines with differing epistemic
      commitments. These groups (such as development studies versus anthropology,
      humanists versus social scientists, or denominational loyalties in theology)
      do not have the same ideas about what good knowledge or impact looks like. They
      serve very different audiences and tend to debate the quality and relevance
      of books and articles that the other side of these commitments produces.  </p><p>Moreover,
      understanding the logics of organizations and how they have distributed collective
      tasks makes us realize that value and relevance require work. Since time is
      scarce, choices have to be made and priorities have to be set. Our anthropology
      case suggests that many anthropologists working on contracts of 80% teaching
      and 20% research, need to be conservative about their time investments. This
      means that finishing an article trumps one\u2019s desire to participate in experimental
      collaborations, experimental types of science communications or experimental
      research directions. </p><p>Concerning the discipline of the organization, theology
      and anthropology are critical and reflective practices. What is value, what
      is impact, what is transformation, where is society? It is these critical interrogations
      of terms and the systems they make sense in that define anthropology, theology,
      and many other SSH domains. This critical interrogation of political and epistemological
      underpinnings of social forms is a crucial contribution to public discussions,
      as social science and humanities scholars keenly emphasize. As these contributions
      are difficult to quantify and make visible within the parameters of the evaluation
      protocol, they require a different approach to the traditional views of research
      results ubiquitous in research evaluations. </p><p>A contextualized approach
      to research evaluation requires a smart combination of evaluation tools and
      methods. In our next post, we will explain how Evaluative Inquiry tailors its
      use of different qualitative and quantitative methods to the research group
      under evaluation. </p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Tjitske

      has declared a COVID-19 \u2018infodemic\u2019: an overabundance of information
      which is often mixed with rumours and misinformation. In light of this, CWTS
      researchers Giovanni Colavizza and Karlijn Roex are conducting a study in which
      they investigate how science is communicated during the coronavirus pandemic.
      All academic researchers, whether they are studying COVID-19 or not, are invited
      to take part in a 10-minute survey.</p><p>The COVID-19 infodemic presents a
      real problem: an overabundance of often unreliable information creates uncertainty
      and anxiety. On the one hand, it is vital that experts and policy-makers know
      how to effectively communicate advice, while on the other hand, the public must
      be well-informed, too, if they are to act in such a way as to contain the spread
      of the virus. Scientists play a pivotal role in the flow of information because
      they need to keep themselves informed and are acting as experts by communicating
      information.</p><p></p><h3><strong>The project</strong></h3><p></p><p>Giovanni
      Colavizza and Karlijn Roex\u2019s project, <em>Collecting systematic survey
      data on scientists\u2019 information-seeking and information-spreading behaviour
      in a time of crisis</em>, aims to inform governments and experts with reliable,
      actionable information. They will conduct systematic, anonymous and regular
      surveys among scientists from all disciplines and investigate how they are adapting
      their information-seeking and -spreading behaviour to the unfolding of this
      infodemic, and will also include the role of different media. Colavizza and
      Roex want to share early insights with not just governments but also health
      officials and experts in order to help them improve their communication practices.
      They furthermore expect that the data gathered in their project will be used
      in future studies concerning the information behaviour of scientists in times
      of crisis.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://covid19.humanities.uva.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">More

      the A-TEAM, we thoroughly evaluate the data we collect, and aim to provide a
      consistent and transparent curation. What we do could also be described as that
      of a detective/archeologist/archivist: through bits and pieces of data we seek
      to unravel the scientific landscape.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                                                                   <p>\u201CWhat
      do you do for work?\u201D is a common conversation starter at social gatherings.
      For doctors or teachers, this is easier to answer, but for members of the A-TEAM
      this is a question that requires a lengthy explanation. The short answer would
      be that we unify organizations in a database, but this does not cover all our
      work. To unify an organization, we need to recognize which type of organization
      it is and what kind of relationships it has with other organizations. Then,
      of course, we must explain what unification means in our context. In short,
      we are busy with ontologies.</p><p>Maybe giving an example would help explain
      what we do. Our job is not always like a fairy tale, but sometimes it can get
      equally unreal.</p><h3>Unravelling the higher education, research system, and
      funding resources</h3><p>Once upon a time there was a higher education institution
      called the University of Ensa\xEFmada. First, we look at what project requires
      us to enter this organization into our database as each project has its own
      criteria when it comes to the number of publications to be used as a minimum
      threshold. Sometimes we must check other criteria such as the education programs
      they offer or demographic implications they may have on other organizations
      in our database. As the University of Ensa\xEFmada fits our criteria, we decide
      to include it in our organization list. To give a few examples, this involves
      assigning it a unique ID and collecting relevant information such as location
      geocodes, up-to-date webpages, foundation years, mergers, persistent IDs if
      any, and connections to other databases/projects.</p><p>A next step is to check
      all the name variations there may be for the organization. This step is also
      known as unification. For example, when research is published by a scientist
      working at the University of Ensa\xEFmada, the name of the university can appear
      as Univ Ensa\xEFmada, Ensa\xEFmada Univ, Univ Ensai Mada, Ensaimad Uni, as well
      as with spelling mistakes as in Univ Ensamiada. The A-TEAM is extremely careful
      on this unification step and we are proud of our results. This data is then
      linked to the entity on the CWTS publication database as identified with a CWTS
      ID.<br></p><p>Sometimes organizations change their names, they are split into
      different organizations, or they merge with others to form even larger organizations.
      As researchers should be able to follow publication data alongside these changes,
      the A-TEAM makes sure they are recorded within our database. As a principle
      we unify in such a way that disaggregation is always possible. For example,
      in 2017 University of Ensa\xEFmada merged with University of Profiterole, yet
      this new organization kept the name of University of Ensa\xEFmada. In this case
      our database would have three entries: one per university before the merger,
      and one for the new university. Thanks to this transparent approach, researchers
      can track such developments.</p><h3>Relationships that contribute to delicious
      research</h3><p>One of the most challenging parts of describing an organization
      concerns its relationships to others. This is necessary to understand how the
      research and higher education system works in the land of P\xE2tisseria. Science
      requires extensive collaboration as researchers do not work alone in isolation.
      To better understand the dynamics between organizations we also classify its
      relationships to others.</p><p>For example, the University of Custard specializes
      in cream while the University of Puff Pastry specializes in layered dough. Together
      they have set up the lab of Applied Dough Combinations where research focuses
      on combinations of layered dough with cream, funded mostly by the Academy of
      Delicious Crafts. The research from this lab owes to these three organizations,
      and our mission is to codify these relationships so that researchers can understand
      how the research came to exist. In our database, these relationships are broadly
      defined as components (closely integrated) and associates (loosely affiliated).</p><p></p><h3>Types
      of organizations that cater to the feast of research</h3><p>Research in P\xE2tisseria
      does not only take place at universities. Some of it is carried out at hospitals,
      museums, research centres, and labs. However, not all hospitals and museums
      conduct research. Part of our task is to investigate what kind of organizations
      they are and how they interconnect in the wider research system. For example,
      the Museum of Baklava has a large collection of photos and documents but does
      not conduct research, as a contrast the Museum of Filo Pastry focuses heavily
      on research. Sometimes museums are both research and exhibition oriented as
      well. Sometimes these museums are standalone entities, but sometimes they are
      affiliated to research organizations or networks of museums, all of these are
      examined by the A-TEAM and entered into our database.</p><p>In P\xE2tisseria
      there are 20 hospitals and clinics. The largest one, University Hospital Briouat,
      not only provides healthcare but produces a large amount of papers per year.
      It also collaborates with the University of Puff Pastry and with the Pastry
      Health Institute. With the former, it provides core curriculum education to
      medicine students as the faculty is located at the hospital and conducts research,
      while with the latter it has two research laboratories.</p><p>Based on its characteristics
      as a healthcare provider and education/research centre, University Hospital
      Briouat could be classified as a hospital, a university, or a research centre.
      It could also be classified as a faculty of the university, but we would miss
      integrating its other functions. In general, we identify organizations by its
      core activity and identify the other functions through relationships. In this
      case, Briouat is classified as a hospital. To signal its close relationship
      with the university, we mark it as a component. The relationship with the Pastry
      Health Institute is less tight according to our criteria and thus we mark them
      as associates.</p><p>This example is relatively straightforward and sometimes
      such relationships can be quite puzzling and intricate. Some hospitals can work
      with various universities or only collaborate for special trainings, while some
      universities place their students for trainings in 10 different hospitals. Our
      task is to investigate and establish how close or loose these various relationships
      can be. Only then can other researchers use our data for future research.</p><p></p><h3>Who
      is funding the research behind a publication?</h3><p>During the last years the
      Ministry for Healthy Bakery, the Foundation for Sweet Life or the Academy of
      Delicious Crafts are financing the research published in P\xE2tisseria, and
      the researchers mention them or the grants they receive in the funding acknowledgment
      section of the publication. In the same way as for the affiliated organizations
      in a paper, the role of the A-TEAM here is to check name variations, change
      of names, relationships among organizations, and type of funding organizations.</p><figure><img

      Lab of Applied Dough Combination is closely affiliated to the University of
      Puff Pastry and the University of Custard, it receives funding from the Academy
      of Delicious Crafts.</figcaption></figure><h3>OK, it is deliciously complicated
      but what is this good for?</h3><p>The information we collect is stored in a
      database that scientists use in order to research various aspects of the science
      system. However, our most famous output can be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\"

      width=\"240\"><figcaption>Thanks to our work, researchers can do delicious research.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Our
      work involves careful evaluations and thorough reviews of the information we
      collect. By checking that all the data about an entity is accurate, we make
      sure that the information is accessible&nbsp;and current. After all, a database
      is only beneficial when the data it contains has been properly curated with
      consistent and transparent methods. Otherwise, what you get is a large heap
      of meaningless data which can only serve as the basis for faulty studies. A
      recent example of this is the inaccurate database from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/covid-19-lancet-retracts-paper-that-halted-hydroxychloroquine-trials\"
      target=\"_blank\">Surgisphere</a> which was used in a now-retracted paper about
      HydroxyChloroquine.</p><p>The challenges of our work are that although much
      of the information for each organization should be public, accessing such information
      is rarely straightforward. Most countries lack an overview of scientific collaborations,
      websites are not kept up to date, and organizations might disappear without
      a trace. We just keep on drinking more and more coffee on such days. We also
      enjoy seeing the actual buildings of the organizations we spend hours understanding,
      which happens quite randomly when we are on work trips. We are, in short, proud
      of and excited about what we do at CWTS every day!</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/ChariteBerlinAndrea.jpg\"

      through bits and pieces of information we seek to unravel the scientific landscape.

      \                                               <p>Today CWTS is releasing the
      2020 edition of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS Leiden Ranking</a>.
      As always, the release of the ranking requires a major effort involving contributions
      from a large number of colleagues at our center. This year, the COVID-19 crisis,
      combined with a major update of the internal data infrastructure at CWTS, created
      additional challenges, which has unfortunately led to a delay of almost two
      months in the release of the ranking.</p><p>We hope, however, that it has been
      worth the wait. In recent years, we have made improvements to the Leiden Ranking
      by enhancing the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2s2a4\">online
      interface</a>, by promoting the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse\">responsible
      use of rankings</a>, and by adding new indicators, in particular indicators
      of <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2w2b4\">open access publishing
      and gender diversity</a>. This year, we have focused on increasing the number
      of universities included in the Leiden Ranking. While the 2019 edition included
      963 universities from 56 different countries, we now have 1,176 universities
      covering 65 countries. Below we present a breakdown of the number of universities
      per country.</p><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R1gSsQn1n6B8PhO2_i2jxCveljKl9S9dV7qEdT96E7gqX7F-FCRtMl5JKYxvoyUjFlg--RGJ3kMpziGm5BF1foo1G_Vr6FRlUTkpuctVPNxqwXe1vCy2Fg5YlULXDZgD3E9gd1gz\"

      1. Breakdown&nbsp;of the number of universities per country</span><p><br></p><p>For
      each university included in the Leiden Ranking, we carefully collect the publications
      indexed in the Web of Science database that belong to the university. This is
      a laborious process that involves a significant amount of manual work. For this
      reason, we need to limit the number of universities in the Leiden Ranking, often
      leading to universities expressing their disappointment about not being covered
      by our ranking. This year, in order to increase the number of universities in
      the ranking, we have decided to make an additional effort. Rather than including
      all universities with at least 1,000 publications in the Web of Science database,
      we have chosen to include all universities that have at least 800 publications
      in the database (time period 2015-2018; fractional counting). This is the main
      explanation for the large increase in the number of universities covered by
      the ranking.</p><p>The Leiden Ranking 2020 provides a huge amount of statistics.
      The ranking covers 1,176 universities, six main fields of science, and ten time
      periods (2006-2009 through 2015-2018). For each combination of a university,
      a main field, and a time period, the ranking provides values for 50 indicators,
      yielding a total of 1,176 \xD7 6 \xD7 10 \xD7 50 = 3.5 million indicator values.
      This clearly offers lots of interesting insights. To illustrate this, there
      is one particular insight that we would like to share.</p><p>The 2020 edition
      of the Leiden Ranking turns out to be the first edition that includes more Chinese
      universities than US universities. In 2019, the Leiden Ranking included a few
      more universities from the US than from China (173 vs. 165). This year, the
      situation has reversed. The Leiden Ranking now covers 204 Chinese universities,
      including six from Hong Kong and one from Macau, and 198 US universities. The
      scatter plot below shows for each university from China (in blue) and the US
      (in orange) the number of publications (horizontal axis; time period 2015-2018;
      fractional counting) and the percentage of highly cited publications (vertical
      axis; publications belonging to the top 10% most highly cited of their field
      and publication year).</p><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YH1f2FrRsV9aN-XU-MJ-WLyPJTPt2ekWduCcPSUxqhzF36Pry_WnOLInc30--Qx53_0UHLG7V_B8bfrPiuwBPDJu7e-G9nAte0OUuMfpyv0BeqxIOnqGh8WGOrxSSr5qef5Oxccu\"

      the percentage of highly cited publications (vertical axis) for Chinese and
      US universities<br></span><p><br></p><p>The scatter plot shows that US universities
      dominate among the universities with the highest percentage of highly cited
      publications. Rockefeller University, located in the top-left in the plot, is
      a clear outlier, with a small output of fewer than 1000 publications, but more
      than 33% highly cited publications. In terms of output, Harvard University,
      located in the far right in the plot, surpasses all other universities, with
      almost 34,000 fractionally counted publications, of which 22% are highly cited.
      However, among the runners-up, we find many Chinese universities, often with
      a fairly decent percentage of highly cited publications.<br></p><p>The chart
      below offers some insight into the growth of the publication output of Chinese
      universities over time. For all Chinese and US universities included in the
      2020 edition of the Leiden Ranking, the chart displays the number of universities
      with at least 800 fractionally counted publications in each of the time periods
      covered by our ranking. Going from the earliest (2006-2009) to the most recent
      (2015-2018) time period, the number of Chinese universities with at least 800
      publications shows a major increase, from 77 to 204, while the increase in the
      number of US universities with at least 800 publications is relatively small,
      from 172 to 198.</p><figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_2-seehIG7oyMoShHKmYnLGz4jJF9rNUR5ZGbsJvrEWRtWafCSLXDHhnUP8Au3sNUjh-Oa-lV9ayT3hwCL9lqlW0_7so2R6MndYCppu5lCT37cfqOzyqyCrpZlcIoG8vemRAe4qf\"

      funding, and geopolitics may have affected the state of knowledge in CRR. Ep.1:
      Careers.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Months
      into the corona crisis we are living in a world changed, for better or worse
      things are <em>other </em>than they once were. It is obvious many countries
      were underprepared, but does it make sense to ask\u2014could this have been
      otherwise? Indeed, this is a prodigious question, one unlikely to be answered
      comprehensively by a blog post. Still, it is the goal of this short series of
      blog posts to reflect on one small portion of this almost overwhelming question.
      In our first installment we reflect on pre-pandemic research funding for coronaviruses
      (like SARS) and its impact on research careers in an attempt to understand how
      these potential pieces might fit into the larger puzzle that is the corona crisis.<br></p><p>There
      were <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/bill-gates-warns-the-next-pandemic-disease-is-coming-2018-4?international=true&r=US\"
      target=\"_blank\">warnings</a>. Public health officials, epidemiologists, and
      researchers of coronaviruses cautioned the world for years of a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/03/health/pandemic-risk-virus-bacteria/index.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">looming global pandemic</a>. In 2018\u2014the hundredth anniversary
      of the Spanish flu\u2014the WHO held a discussion entitled: <em><a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/global-pandemic-3818811-Jan2018/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Are we ready for the next pandemic?</a></em>. Their answer:
      an emphatic <em>No</em>. Despite these warnings as well as warnings of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-reutersmagazine-davos-flu-economy/flu-conomics-the-next-pandemic-could-trigger-global-recession-idUSBRE90K0F820130121\"
      target=\"_blank\">corresponding global recession</a>, research on coronaviruses
      (similar to public health research more broadly) <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/11/28/global-health-disruptors-sars-and-ebola/\"
      target=\"_blank\">remained underfunded</a>. The small research field suffered
      from a boom-and-bust cycle, corresponding to the two previous outbreaks. First
      with SARS in 2002 and again in 2012 with the MERS outbreak, funding of coronavirus
      related research (CRR) increased in response to the outbreak and waned thereafter.
      This cycle becomes clear when visualizing CRR publications over time (see Figure
      1 below)\u2014in 2019 CCR was, again, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.046144v1\"
      target=\"_blank\">on the decline</a>.  </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/b1.png\"
      data-image=\"12971\"></figure><p><em>Fig. 1: Trend in number of publications
      in the field of corona related research, Web of Science, 1981-2019</em></p><p>We
      were unsatisfied by this generalized observation and sought to dig deeper into
      pre-Covid-19 funding for CRR in order to gain a detailed overview of the funding
      available (see Figure 2). Following the definition as applied in <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.046144v1\"
      target=\"_blank\">the work of Colavizza et. al</a>, we selected all publications
      from Web of Science containing the relevant terms in their titles and abstracts
      to identify a set of publications on CRR and investigated how many of these
      CRR publications contained explicit funding acknowledgements. </p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/b2.png\" data-image=\"12972\"></figure><p><em>Fig.
      2: Trend in number of publications in the field of corona related research (CRR)
      containing funding acknowledgments, Web of Science, 2010-2019</em></p><p>Upon
      first inspection one sees a field with a high percentage of (externally) funded
      research. This high-level of funding was unexpected as it, initially, seems
      to contradict claims of CRR being underfunded. Yet, we asked ourselves: <em>are
      there perhaps other explanations? </em>When compared to other scientific fields,
      like cardiology (known to be well-funded, see Figure 3 below), CRR has a markedly
      higher percentage of research with funding acknowledgements. </p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/b3.png\" data-image=\"12973\"></figure><p><em>Fig.
      3: Trend in number of publications in cardiology research containing funding
      acknowledgments, Web of Science, 2010-2019</em></p><p>We suggest one potential
      reason for this trend could be that the field lacks support from the kinds of
      sustained institutionalized funding (not usually acknowledged in a publication)
      from which well-funded fields like cardiology may benefit and, thus, relies
      heavily on external grant-based funding. Potentially, reliance on this type
      of\u2014often temporary and precarious\u2014funding mechanism could have created
      many difficulties in the building of sustained research lines on coronaviruses.</p><p>Science
      and evaluation studies have shown the type(s) of funding available to a research
      field can have great effects on many aspects of its research, such as: the amount
      of research being conducted; the type(s) of research valued; or the viability
      and desirability of a career in a certain (sub-)field. Interestingly, some coronavirus
      researchers themselves describe the field before the crisis as one largely shaped
      by the waxing and waning of interest in coronaviruses, which led to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/10/fluctuating-funding-and-flagging-interest-hurt-coronavirus-research/\"
      target=\"_blank\">knowledge gaps in fundamental research and unstable career
      trajectories</a> for researchers attempting to build a career in coronaviruses.
      These researchers claimed those in the field struggled both to justify their
      continued research to funding bodies and to establish themselves in the field,
      leading many to choose a research path outside of it. They contend this early-stage
      exodus of researchers from the field produced a <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/10/fluctuating-funding-and-flagging-interest-hurt-coronavirus-research/\"
      target=\"_blank\">distinct career stratification</a> with a very minimal middle-stage
      stratum. </p><p>Building upon our examination of pre-pandemic coronavirus funding
      and the assertions of these coronavirus researchers, we decided to look deeper
      into their claims by analyzing CRR careers via publication trends in relation
      to academic age of pre-pandemic coronavirus researchers\u2014with academic age
      (i.e. amount of years since a researcher\u2019s first publication in CRR) acting
      as a proxy for the amount of years a researcher remained active in CRR. Our
      preliminary findings seem to support their claims, displaying atypical field
      characteristics. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/b4_3.png\"
      data-image=\"13498\"></figure><p><em>Fig. 4: Connecting career stages to CRR
      related output shares, Web of Science, 1981-2019. </em></p><p>As visible in
      Figure 4, one can discern a large cohort of young scientists, who appear to
      be publishing most of their work in the field; a number of well-established,
      long-term researchers, who have only a share of their research in the field;
      and a noticeable absence of cohorts in between. In most research fields one
      could expect to track multiple cohorts of researchers as they move through their
      research careers, but this movement appears to be absent in pre-pandemic CRR.
      Instead, it seems a large majority of starting researchers disappear from CRR
      after their first 4 to 7 years and few publications, suggesting, after their
      PhD or post-doc, these researchers move to other areas or leave research altogether.
      Another interesting trend is noticeable amongst the established researchers,
      who seem to only have a modest share of their output (less than 10% of their
      total output) in CRR. Although comparisons with other fields of research are
      needed to further substantiate these findings, they indeed suggest building
      a sustained career on CRR alone is very difficult\u2014or at the very least
      unlikely to happen. Furthermore, our findings are indicative of a field brimming
      with uncertainty and instability\u2014qualities that seem counterproductive
      for understanding a group of deadly viruses. </p><p>For now, the questions remain:
      <em>What do these initial findings mean? What could we as a society have done
      differently? </em>And, if something is to be gained: <em>How can we perhaps
      learn from our mistakes in order to be better prepared in the future? </em>There
      are many more viruses in existence with pandemic potential\u2014coronaviruses
      are just one of them. In addition, let us not forget there are many common,&nbsp;
      <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326440/\" target=\"_blank\">harmful
      pathogens that remain disproportionately understudied and underfunded</a>\u2014particularly
      those&nbsp;occurring mostly outside the global North&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1020721\"
      target=\"_blank\">Tuberculosis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2017/en/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Malaria</a>\r\nand <a href=\"https://healthpolicy-watch.news/lack-of-funding-takes-major-toll-on-ebola-response/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Ebola</a>). Learning how to better research and respond to
      these threats may also necessitate a long, hard look at what types of research
      on pathogens is deemed worthy of funding and why, with particular attention
      given to their geographies.</p><p>Much more research is urgently needed. For
      our next episodes, we are working on deepening our exploration into pre-pandemic
      funding of CRR and its effects on both the structure and knowledge production
      potential of coronavirus research. This blog post is meant to be provocative,
      not conclusive. As our explorations into the peculiarities of CRR in relation
      to research careers and funding are only tentative, it is our hope that this
      provocation invites you to join us in the discussion. So, we leave you with
      some important questions: <em>What do you think this means? Could certain systematic
      issues of how research is funded and how careers can (or cannot) be built on
      particular topics have made a crucial difference in the pre-pandemic state of
      our knowledge on coronaviruses? Could it have been otherwise?</em></p><p>A note

      interesting preliminary results, stay tuned!</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>There are many reasons why
      we should be concerned with how science is portrayed in the news media, particularly
      given the <a href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19659/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018infodemic\u2019
      related to COVID-19</a>. For example, over-hyped research results can lead to
      misinterpretation that may contribute, among other things, to public skepticism
      and distrust towards science. Because of that, we began to wonder how we could
      start the exploration of the news reception about the science related to the
      pandemic. More specifically, we decided to explore the potential of natural
      language processing (NLP), which incorporates sentiment analysis as an important
      indicator of expression of news media sentiment about COVID-19 findings. As
      a disclaimer, the analysis presented in this blog post should be seen as a preliminary
      exploration on how sentiment approaches can be implemented in the study of the
      reception of scientific content in social and news media outlets.<br></p><p>In
      our experiment we used an <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.046144v1\"
      target=\"_blank\">existing dataset of scientific publications related to research
      on COVID-19</a> updated up to April 24th, 2020 and matched it with data by <a
      href=\"http://altmetric.com\" target=\"_blank\">Altmetric.com</a> (Figure 1).
      From this dataset, we selected publications related to the pandemic as indicated
      by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a>\r\nor <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dimensions</a>. Since our analysis focused on texts, we filtered
      out publications without an abstract. Also, from the data obtained from Altmetric.com
      we removed news articles that did not come with a <em>summary </em>text (this
      summary typically contains about the first 250 characters of the news media
      text). We ended up with a dataset of 1,910 publications with an abstract and
      mentions in 38,611 different news media posts.</p><h3>The Sentiment Analysis</h3><p>To
      obtain the sentiments apparent in the news articles, we used a sentiment extraction
      transformer built on top of BERT (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805\"
      target=\"_blank\">Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers</a>)
      (See <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\" target=\"_blank\">Vaswani
      </a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\" target=\"_blank\"><em>et al</em></a><a
      href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\" target=\"_blank\">, 2017</a>). We
      use the <em>bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment </em>model, which is trained
      in six different languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian,
      and is fine-tuned on a set of 500,000 product reviews with sentiment labels
      ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 is a bad review and 4 is a good review (the pretrained
      model can be accessed <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Thus, sentiment scores range between 0 and 4 and
      can be interpreted as follows: 0=\u2018very negative\u2019, 1=\u2018negative\u2019,
      2=\u2018neutral\u2019, 3=\u2019positive\u2019, 4=\u2019very positive\u2019.</p><figure><img

      has the science around COVID-19 been received in the news?</h3><p>To get a sense
      of how well BERT dealt with topics related to COVID-19 research in the news
      we plot a term map of the most commonly co-occurring terms in scientific articles.
      Then, we overlay the average BERT sentiment scores of news corresponding to
      each paper in the dataset in order to represent the sentiment of news items
      around COVID-19 research. As we can see, BERT seems to be able to identify paper
      topics related to solutions like vaccines and treatments as more neutral/slightly
      positive news media pieces. On the other hand, articles on the topic of symptoms
      such as fever, hypertension, and policy measures to control the virus are more
      negatively reported in the news.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/news_sentiment_2.png\"

      This visualization illustrates a co-occurrence map of the most common terms
      that are used in titles and abstracts of the selected papers. Warm colors (red)
      indicate where the positive attention of the media has focused on, while cool
      colors (blue) indicate negative attention. Terms such as \u201Cfever\u201D and
      \u201Cvaccine\u201D are among the most commonly used terms, and also \u201Cdrug\u201D,
      \u201Cclinical trial\u201D, \u201Cantibody\u201D, and \u201Ccontrol measures\u201D
      can be seen among the more frequently used terms. News talks positively about
      publication topics related to vaccines, antibodies and drugs, while talking
      about control measures and fever news posts tend to have a more negative sentiment.</span><p><br>We
      also analyzed the temporal dynamics of the news items and aggregated the average
      sentiment of the sentences of all the news on a given day (Figures 2 and 3).
      The number of news items around COVID-19 related scientific publications has
      increased over time, particularly from mid-March onwards, a pattern that has
      also been observed for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05783\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>,
      other <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/monitoring-the-dissemination-of-covid-19-related-scientific-publications-in-online-media\"

      Conversation</a>. During the period of higher news activity (March-April), the
      mean sentiment scores oscillate between slight negativity (1.5) and neutrality
      (2) (Figure 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/news_sentiment_3.png\"

      interesting piece of information recorded by Altmetric.com are the sources of
      the news items. This enables the study of the type of sentiments expressed by
      the different news items providers (Figure 4).  </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/news_sentiment_5.png\"
      data-image=\"12123\"></figure><p><span class=\"caption\"><strong>Figure 4.</strong>
      Top 35 news outlets characterized by the average sentiment in their news items.</span></p><p>Interestingly,
      some of the most popular news outlets related to medical research (e.g. <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>MedicalXpress</em></a><em>,</em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>The Conversation</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Medscape</em></a>) exhibit values very close to 2, suggesting
      a high degree of neutrality in their dissemination of COVID-19 science related
      news. In contrast, business-related news outlets (<a href=\"http://businessinsider.com\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>Business Insid</em></a><a href=\"about:blank\"><em>er</em></a>
      - Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, India or the Netherlands) tend to have a more
      negative sentiment in their news items, perhaps due to the negativity around
      the critical economic situation caused by the pandemic. Other news aggregators
      such as <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Yahoo! News</em></a>,
      <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MSN</em></a>,
      or <a href=\"https://news.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Google News</em></a>
      also exhibit rather negative sentiments, which is in line with news media such
      as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New York Time</em></a><a
      href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">s</a>, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>CNN News</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. An interesting exception is the
      conservative channel <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fox
      News</em></a>, with a fairly positive coverage of the research around the pandemic.</p><h3>What
      did we learn from this exercise?</h3><p>This is a first analysis of the sentiment
      of news items covering scientific articles about COVID-19. Overall, we observe
      a slight increase in the neutrality of news as they move from a slightly negative
      sentiment in the early months to a more neutral sentiment of scientific findings.
      On average, paper topics related to solutions like vaccines and treatments tend
      to be more neutral or positively treated in the news, while paper topics about
      transmission and control measures are more negatively disseminated. Medical-related
      news sources tend to present more neutral views, while generalistic and business-related
      news outlets write more negatively about scientific research related to the
      virus.</p><p>However, this exercise is by no means in its final stages. Given
      the <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs\">lack
      of abstracts in many of the publications</a> and occasionally of summary text
      from news items, we could only study a limited selection of publications and
      news media items. In the future we will consider larger sets of publications
      and news media items. Another concern is that we used an already trained BERT
      model fine tuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews, and used it for
      classifying news items about research. While models like BERT can be generalized
      to different contexts (especially social media), we could have obtained state-of-the-art
      classification by fine tuning the model with a corpus of research articles about
      COVID-19 and related news items instead.</p><p>Nevertheless, BERT reveals interesting
      findings that we think are worth sharing in this blog post. It also shows the
      potential of Machine Learning such as text classification for further studying
      and characterizing the online and social media reception of scientific outputs.
      Tips on improvement would be greatly appreciated!</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>We

      trend in research evaluation is to include stakeholders as active partners in
      the evaluation process. In June, CWTS organized an online workshop to explore
      novel evaluation approaches and to identify possibilities and limitations for
      co-production in research evaluation.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>\u201CFund and forget\u201D,
      that is how Jordi Molas-Gallart from the research centre <a href=\"https://www.ingenio.upv.es/en/about-us\">Ingenio</a>
      (CSIC-UPV) in Val\xE8ncia teasingly characterized the way large national research
      funders often operate. It\u2019s also a point of departure for thinking about
      new ways of research evaluation. The cornerstones of many forms of research
      evaluation are peer review and bibliometric analysis. Interestingly, peer review
      as practiced by evaluation committees, on closer inspection typically consists
      of judgement based on intimate entanglement of peer review and information based
      bibliometric indicators, to the point that the two are often hard to separate.</p><p>What
      research evaluation currently looks like is relatively clear, the road ahead
      is a little less so. But there is a shift visible towards formative and participatory
      forms of evaluation. One key assumption in those new approaches is that the
      traditional distinction between research evaluators, the organisations they
      are evaluating and societal stakeholders can no longer hold: intensive interactions
      between the three can help to make evaluations more relevant, more productive
      and more effective in terms of learning. Co-production models stress the need
      for contribution from stakeholders throughout the whole evaluation process,
      with the aim of creating synergy between the various people and groups involved.
      And ideally the use of a co-production model results in stakeholders experiencing
      a shared responsibility for the outcomes. </p><p>How stakeholder involvement
      or \u2018co-production\u2019 works out in practice was the topic of an online
      workshop, organised on June 4<sup>th</sup> by CWTS, as part of its \u2018<a
      href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/thematic-hubs/responsible-evaluation\">Responsible
      Evaluation</a>\u2019 and \u2018<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/thematic-hubs/engagement-and-responsibility-in-ri\">Engagement
      and RRI</a>\u2019 thematic hubs. The close to thirty participants were drafted
      from CWTS and various (research) organisations involved in or thinking about
      research evaluation.</p><p>The workshop started with three brief presentations
      about \u2018new\u2019 forms of evaluation. Pierre-Benoit Joly (INRA) introduced
      a novel method for <a href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02382425/\">real-time
      assessment of research impact</a>, building on the ASIRPA tool that has become
      mainstream in the French agricultural research institute INRA. Jordi Molas-Gallart
      (Ingenio, CSIC-UPV) introduced a formative approach to the <a href=\"http://www.tipconsortium.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evaluation-Policy-Brief-03.04.19.pdf\">evaluation
      of transformative innovation policy</a>. Tjitske Holtrop (CWTS) introduced the
      main principles of <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-i-academic-value-is-more-than-performance\">Evaluative
      Inquiry</a>, a multi-method approach to analyse the interaction between knowledge
      production and societal practices. In breakout rooms participants focused on
      the (possible) role of societal stakeholders in evaluation, which brought about
      discussions in many directions.</p><p>More questions were raised than answered,
      as expected in a field that is contested and quickly developing. For example,
      there seems to be a blurring of boundaries between formative evaluators and
      co-creation partners. And if the distance between evaluators and research performers
      gets smaller, does that leave enough room for \u2018independent\u2019 critical
      feedback? Or should we define an inner and outer circle of stakeholders that
      are differently involved in research evaluation? If a research organisation
      has only a single large stakeholder, which also is involved in evaluating that
      organisation, questions of academic freedom or conflicts of interest may arise.
      </p><p>Or should we even go beyond involving stakeholders as additions to evaluation,
      and instead thinking about mutual benefits by the continuous inclusion of relevant
      stakeholders with the research? Then a co-production type of evaluation may
      become real-time, instead of ex post or ex ante. In such a configuration, one
      can even wonder what the difference is between an evaluator and a partner in
      knowledge co-production. </p><p>Some research funders are experimenting with
      <strong>ex ante</strong> involvement of stakeholders in reviewing research proposals,
      but this is not widespread and review is still dominated by the scientific community.<br></p><p>We
      hope that this initial workshop can function as a stepping stone towards a broader
      dialogue about the opportunities and limitations of formative and participatory
      research evaluation. The feedback we received from participants suggests that
      there is a need for more debate and exchange. </p><p>As a direct follow-up we
      consider to organize workshops on more specific themes in this area, such as:</p><ul><li>How
      to deal with relationships between scientific and societal value in institutional
      research evaluation?</li><li>What are the opportunities of formative and participatory
      methods in natural sciences versus social sciences and humanities?</li><li>What
      is the potential of real-time impact assessment for research funding programmes?</li></ul><p>The
      original blog post included a paragraph about the Dutch Strategy Evaluation
      Protocol (SEP), but that was removed because it unintendedly suggested that
      the SEP does not encourage involvement of stakeholders.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Rinze

      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">open access to coronavirus literature</a>.</p><p>In
      this post, we focus on a key issue at the interface of these two developments:
      The open availability of abstracts of scientific articles. Abstracts provide
      a summary of an article and are part of an article\u2019s metadata. We first
      discuss the many ways in which abstracts can be used and we then explore the
      availability of abstracts. The open availability of abstracts is surprisingly
      limited. This creates important obstacles to scientific literature search, bibliometric
      analysis, and automatic knowledge extraction.</p><h3>The many uses of abstracts</h3><p>The
      most basic way in which researchers benefit from abstracts is clear: Abstracts
      provide a summary of an article and are used by researchers to quickly decide
      whether an article is likely to be of interest. In addition, however, abstracts
      are also used in a large number of more advanced ways.</p><p>Abstracts of course
      play an important role in scientific literature search. Databases such as <a
      href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Web
      of Science</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener
      nofollow\">Scopus</a>, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PubMed</a> enable searching in abstracts of articles,
      and so do many lesser known alternatives (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.scilit.net/\"

      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Open Ukrainian Citation Index</a>).
      Other databases (e.g., <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Google Scholar</a>) support full-text search, but
      in many cases (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"

      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lens</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PubMed Central</a>) these databases
      also offer the possibility to restrict a search to abstracts only, which will
      give more focused results.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Open-abstracts-1.png\"

      can also be used to improve the functionality of many library systems, such
      as library discovery systems like <a href=\"https://www.exlibrisgroup.com/products/primo-discovery-service/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Primo</a> and <a href=\"https://about.proquest.com/products-services/discovery-services/The-Summon-Service.html\"

      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Converis</a>, and more. Institutional
      repository (IR) managers can improve the discoverability of their IR content
      by enhancing IR entries with abstracts, similar to what <a href=\"https://scholarlycommunications.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2020/02/24/core-raises-repository-data-quality-by-consolidating-information-from-external-datasets/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CORE</a> has done.</p><p>Some libraries,
      for instance in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OsmaSuominen/status/1252921488174432256\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Finland</a>, use automated methods
      for subject indexing of their IR content. This can be done based on titles and
      abstracts of articles. It doesn\u2019t require full texts. Microsoft Academic
      for instance uses abstracts, not full texts, for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12216\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tagging fields of study to articles</a>.</p><p>A
      different way of using abstracts is illustrated by <a href=\"https://gettheresearch.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Get The Research</a>, which aims
      to help readers, in particular from outside academia, find and understand scientific
      articles. Titles and abstracts of articles, taken from PubMed, are enriched
      by adding links to plain language explanations of scientific terms, obtained
      from Wikipedia. In this case, abstracts have a benefit for a wide audience,
      also outside academia.</p><p>Abstracts also play a crucial role in systematic
      reviewing. Literature searches for systematic reviews are usually done in the
      titles, abstracts, and keywords of articles, and the search results are typically
      screened (manually and sometimes assisted by machine learning) based on titles
      and abstracts. Hence, <a href=\"https://asreview.nl/the-importance-of-abstracts/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">abstracts are essential</a> for
      high-quality systematic reviewing. An example is the <a href=\"https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/covid-19.html\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">screening of the CORD-19 dataset</a>
      of COVID-19 related articles using the <a href=\"https://asreview.nl/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ASReview tool</a>. However, the fact that abstracts
      are missing for 22% of the articles in the full CORD-19 dataset, and even for
      36% of the CORD-19 articles from 2020, limits the use of the dataset.</p><figure><em><img

      class=\"caption\"><em></em>ASReview: Using abstracts to screen articles for
      systematic reviewing</span><p></p><p>The most sophisticated uses of abstracts
      arguably can be found in the biomedical domain, where the open availability
      of abstracts in PubMed has spurred innovation. One example is PubMed\u2019s
      feature for finding <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/020_190.html\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">similar articles</a>, which compares
      articles based on their titles and abstracts. Another example can be found in
      <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Europe
      PMC</a>, where the <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/annotations\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">SciLite platform</a> provides annotations of biomedical
      entities identified in abstracts (and full text, if available) using text mining
      algorithms. Identification of biomedical entities in abstracts enables computational
      analyses of associations between these entities. Gene-disease associations have
      for instance been extracted from abstracts by the LHGDN (Literature-derived
      human gene-disease network) and <a href=\"http://ibi.imim.es/befree/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BeFree</a> systems and have been made available in
      the <a href=\"https://www.disgenet.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DisGeNET
      database</a>. In a similar way, researchers have developed algorithms for extracting
      protein-protein interactions from the abstracts of biomedical articles. Although
      similar approaches to the use of abstracts for automatic knowledge extraction
      are also being explored in other fields of research (e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1335-8\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">materials science</a>), the biomedical
      domain is clearly ahead of these other fields. This is most likely due to the
      open availability of abstracts in PubMed.</p><figure><em><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Open-abstracts-5.png\"

      Instructions on <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/annotations\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">using annotations</a><em></em></span><p></p><p>As
      the above examples illustrate, abstracts have many uses. This is true even given
      the increasing number of articles for which the full text is openly accessible.
      While it would often be beneficial to have access to full texts rather than
      just abstracts, such access is unfortunately not yet a given for the full scholarly
      literature. In many cases, however, it is a deliberate choice to work with abstracts
      rather than full texts, even when the full text of articles is accessible. This
      can be for technical reasons, but also because abstracts provide a more focused
      description of the underlying research. For instance, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.046144\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recent analysis</a> of the CORD-19
      dataset of COVID-related articles showed that only 24% of the CORD-19 articles
      available in Web of Science include COVID-related terms in their title, abstract,
      or keywords \u2014 restricting to this subset may give more targeted results
      than using the full dataset.</p><p></p><h3>Availability of abstracts</h3><p>The
      ways in which researchers benefit from abstracts are quite varied. But are abstracts
      generally available for the various use cases discussed above?</p><p>Abstracts
      are mostly freely accessible on publisher websites. This facilitates the most
      basic use case for abstracts, namely to enable researchers to easily get a general
      understanding of what an article is about. However, for the other use cases
      discussed above, having free access to abstracts on publisher websites is not
      enough. These use cases require bulk access to machine readable abstracts.</p><p>Commercial
      and proprietary bibliographic databases such as <a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Web of Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Scopus</a> provide a good coverage
      of abstracts. However, in addition to the cost of accessing them, they have
      the limitation of being selective in scope, not covering the full breadth of
      the scholarly literature. Moreover, they impose restrictions on the number of
      abstracts that can be downloaded from the database and the way these abstracts
      can be used. <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener
      nofollow\">Dimensions</a> is generally less selective and provides free access,
      but it currently has the disadvantage that abstracts cannot be downloaded. (The
      Dimensions team informed us that they plan to make abstracts available for download
      in the near future.)</p><p><a href=\"https://academic.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Microsoft Academic</a>, which is openly available
      under an <a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/index.html\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ODC-BY license</a>, provides some
      hope though. It is pretty comprehensive in scope and is also being used by other
      databases such as the <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener
      nofollow\">Lens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Semantic Scholar</a>. However, as Microsoft Academic
      obtains its data by scraping the World Wide Web, abstracts suffer from some
      quality problems. In an analysis of abstracts in Microsoft Academic, we for
      instance found that abstracts are sometimes truncated and that they sometimes
      include text that actually doesn\u2019t belong to the abstract (e.g., author
      and affiliation data or the opening paragraph of an article).</p><p>Like Microsoft
      Academic, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener
      nofollow\">PubMed</a> makes abstracts openly available. Since PubMed receives
      abstracts directly from publishers, the data quality is higher than in the case
      of Microsoft Academic. However, PubMed has the limitation of being restricted
      to biomedical research.</p><p>Another cross-domain source of bibliographic metadata,
      including abstracts, is <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener
      nofollow\">CORE</a> (COnnecting REpositories) \u2014 one of the largest aggregators
      of research articles harvested from subject and institutional repositories as
      well as open access and hybrid journals. The data is free to access and for
      non-commercial purposes the data can also be freely downloaded. CORE content
      is for instance used in the Lens. The exact coverage of CORE, especially for
      metadata of paywalled articles, is hard to ascertain.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Open-abstracts-6.png\"
      data-image=\"11070\"></figure><span class=\"caption\">Availability of abstracts
      in Crossref for different publishers (journal content, 2018\u20132020)</span><p><br></p><p>Finally,
      an important source of bibliographic metadata is provided by <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Crossref</a>, a not-for-profit organization
      that most international publishers work with to register Digital Object Identifiers
      (DOIs) for their content. Except for some citation data, all metadata in Crossref
      is openly available. Unlike Microsoft Academic, Crossref receives its metadata
      directly from publishers, resulting in a higher data quality, and unlike PubMed,
      Crossref is not restricted to biomedical research. However, although Crossref
      offers a first-class infrastructure for making abstracts openly available, the
      actual number of abstracts in Crossref is disappointingly low. At the moment,
      only 8% of all journal articles in Crossref have an abstract. For recent years,
      this percentage is somewhat higher (20% for 2018\u20132020). As shown in the
      figure above, many publishers do not make abstracts available in Crossref, or
      they have done so only for a small share of their articles. More detailed information
      for individual publishers can be found in Crossref\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Participation Reports</a>.</p><figure><img

      journal content</a>)</span><p></p><h3>Making abstracts openly available</h3><p>As
      we have seen, abstracts are of great value for scientific literature search,
      bibliometric analysis, and automatic knowledge extraction. Innovative uses of
      abstracts can be found in particular in biomedical fields, which benefit from
      the open availability of abstracts in PubMed. However, outside the biomedical
      domain, the lack of a centralized database in which abstracts are made openly
      available hinders the development of innovative new tools to support researchers.
      This will inevitably slow down the speed at which researchers come up with new
      ideas and make new discoveries.</p><p>Microsoft Academic is the most comprehensive
      open source of abstracts. It is of great value, but it has two limitations.
      First, since abstracts have been scraped from the Web, they suffer from data
      quality issues. And second, we don\u2019t know much about the long-term prospects
      of Microsoft Academic, which depend on Microsoft\u2019s willingness to continue
      investing in Microsoft Academic and to keep the data open.</p><p>Crossref clearly
      provides the most promising centralized infrastructure for making abstracts
      openly available. While this infrastructure is readily available to all publishers
      working with Crossref, many of them unfortunately do not yet make use of it,
      perhaps because they are not aware of it or do not see its value.</p><p>Thanks
      to the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Initiative
      for Open Citations</a>, a large number of publishers have made the reference
      lists of their articles openly available in Crossref. In the same spirit, we
      call on publishers to make abstracts openly available in Crossref. Publishers
      already make the abstracts of articles in biomedical fields openly available
      in PubMed, so why not use the infrastructure of Crossref to do the same for
      articles in all fields? By making this small effort, publishers not only give
      additional visibility to their content, but they also make a large contribution
      to the benefit of science.</p><p><em>This post is licensed under a CC BY 4.0

      evaluation metrics tend to understand academic value as performance while missing
      other valuable elements of academic value trajectories. This first of four blogposts
      focuses on the concept of value of the Evaluative Inquiry\u2019s approach to
      research evaluation.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>The
      world of research evaluation is changing. In particular, we observe a growing
      need in research organizations for interactive, formative and tailor-made evaluation
      services. In response to this need, a team of CWTS colleagues has developed
      a new approach in collaboration with <a href=\"https://adprins.nl/\">Ad Prins</a>
      that we call the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2u2b4&title=the-evaluative-inquiry-a-new-approach-to-academic-evaluation\">Evaluative
      Inquiry</a>. Over the past few years this approach has been put to practice
      in several projects mainly assisting research groups and institutes with putting
      together the self-evaluation document of the <a href=\"https://vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP2015-2021.pdf\">Standard
      Evaluation Protocol (SEP)</a>. On the basis of these experiences, and most notably
      the projects with the Protestant Theological University and with the University
      for Humanistic Studies, we want to describe the four underpinnings of this Evaluative
      Inquiry in a series of blog posts: open-ended concept of research value; contextualization;
      mixed-method approach; and a focus on both accounting and learning. This first
      post focuses on our concept of value.</p><p>Both protestants and humanists approached
      CWTS to ask for help with their self-evaluation. These small universities with
      diverse workloads and publication cultures combine characteristics of the broad
      and diverse academic Social Science and Humanities (SSH) domain and have distinct
      philosophical and spiritual missions. It was a challenge to provide strong proof
      of their societal relevance and scientific excellence which was demanded by
      the formal SEP protocol. Their questions about benchmarking, visibility through
      citation patterns, and \u201Clists\u201D of productivity revealed a worry that
      their books and carefully crafted single-authored papers weren\u2019t going
      to demonstrate the vital characteristics of their work. </p><p>In recent years
      societal relevance was <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/spp/article/36/5/387/1730519\">added
      to the evaluative palette of the SEP protocol</a>, adding performances of academics
      in the public debate or collaborations with societal stakeholders to the understanding
      of impact. However, do sermons that staff members of the Protestant Theological
      University (PThU) occasionally preach count towards impact? And what can be
      said of the multiple advisory roles in institutions, with research informants,
      in political parties or the cultural sector that theologians and humanists have,
      that are often informal and not traceable to reports, media performances or
      otherwise? These relations are said to be so local and small-scale that they
      are almost invisible, so what is their impact, and how to count it?  </p><p>The
      problem of the value of academic research, then, for our SSH clients lies in
      the fact that they understand it in the realm of performance, of impact that
      can be shown in metrics. However, this reduces the concept of value to measurable
      achievements and does not do justice to the multiple possible contributions
      that researchers make both to science and society. Moreover, it understands
      value as the vehicle for accountability, showing one\u2019s worth according
      to an external standard of excellence. The Evaluative Inquiry (EI) is, instead,
      interested in value as the connection between the institution\u2019s mission
      or research themes and their reception and use by others in the world around
      the institution. As the EI\u2019s first principle, this focus on \u201Cvalue
      trajectories\u201D opens up the concept of academic value and moves it away
      from a focus on citation scores to finding dense and vital activity around research
      themes and ambitions. This implies that EI does not necessarily adopt the distinction
      between scientific and societal value of knowledge that has become commonplace
      in research evaluation. The Evaluative Inquiry draws both on metrics and on
      qualitative analyses as ways or making these trajectories visible. </p><p>In
      the first phase of the Evaluative Inquiry with the theologians and humanists
      we invited them to think about their value as something that goes beyond what
      can be expressed in performance metrics and the inherent anxiety about how they
      compare to others that goes along with it. In these exploratory conversations
      the EI team has spent quite a bit of time explaining this and the benefits of
      attuning research ambitions, research strengths, and research organizations.
      For the theologians this brought up the effects they felt of the declining appeal
      of theology in society and the downsizing of a thriving theological academy
      to a handful of institutions scrambling for students and research funding. Over
      time one of the ambitions that ensued from our conversations and analyses was
      to showcase the multidisciplinarity and spiritual orientations of the PThU while
      balancing the diverse demands of a small organization on its employees with
      needs and professional ambitions of the latter. </p><p>To conclude, what is
      of value and to be valued is not fixed. When clients choose to work with this
      method, the Evaluative Inquiry takes the time for probing and exploring to find
      out where their value is and what it looks like. Making visible organizational
      specifics and ambitions are not meant to better situate performance and productivity
      metrics, but to expand what can be considered as good academic value. Good academic
      value, then, goes beyond writing articles and counting citations to also include
      maintaining organizations and building conversations. This is not to say that
      we deny the importance and use of performance metrics and accountability; it
      is a way to expand the stories we consider to be achievements and want to account
      for.</p><p><em>Read part II of the series <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/evaluative-inquiry-ii-evaluating-research-in-context\"

      response to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers from all over the world and from
      multidisciplinary backgrounds are working on answers to the challenges raised
      by the disease. In this regard, the biomedical point of view is also accompanied
      by broader social, economic and political perspectives. At CWTS, a dedicated
      research program has recently been <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-on-covid-19\"
      target=\"_blank\">initiated</a>, with the aim of engaging colleagues and perspectives
      from <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/broadening-the-perspective-on-covid-19\"
      target=\"_blank\">diverse disciplines</a> in the research and discussion of
      the science-related aspects of the pandemic. The research program has started
      to produce its first results, including the analysis of <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/covid-19-what-do-funders-consider-relevant-research\"
      target=\"_blank\">funding</a> decisions, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.045963v1\"

      target=\"_blank\">delineating </a>COVID-19 and coronavirus research, among other
      questions. </p><h3>Broadening the study of the online media response to COVID-19-related
      research</h3><p>Another dimension that we also consider central at CWTS is how
      the scientific results related to the pandemic are being <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-on-covid-19/covid-19-research-on-social-media\"
      target=\"_blank\">disseminated and received across online (social) media platforms</a>.
      Probably, one of the most visible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been
      the surge of news, social media, and online information about the disease, as
      well as its political, social and health related effects. It is evident that
      in the interplay of scientists, policymakers, communicators, and society, the
      pandemic has posed multiple challenges for science communication. As a consequence,
      there are also many questions that can be studied from a point of view that
      incorporates means of dissemination different from scholarly communication via
      scientific publications. At CWTS, we have started to research the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05783\"
      target=\"_blank\">Twitter uptake of the science related to the pandemic</a>,
      the <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.087643v1.full\"
      target=\"_blank\">incorporation of these results in Wikipedia articles</a>,

      platform The Conversation</a>. </p><h3>Monitoring the social media reception
      of COVID-19-related research</h3><p>With the many different questions and challenges
      arising from the study of online communication around the pandemic, it is impossible
      to approach all of them from just one perspective. In this situation, a flexible
      tool for monitoring how research around the pandemic is being disseminated and
      discussed on social media is necessary. We have developed a dashboard that provides
      exactly that: the <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/rodrigo4482#!/vizhome/Covid-19socialmediadashboard_210120/CovidTrendAnalysis\"
      target=\"_blank\">CWTS COVID-19 social media dashboard</a> offers an easy-to-use
      visual and flexible tool to explore the online media reception of scientific
      publications related to COVID-19. It can be used by anyone - scientists, policymakers,
      journalists and science communicators, or citizens - interested in the uptake
      of scientific publications related to COVID-19 across multiple online and social
      media platforms.</p><figure style=\"border:none;\"><iframe scrolling=\"no\"

      analytical views</strong>: <strong><em>trend analysis</em></strong> and <strong><em>scatterplots</em></strong>
      to <strong><em>explore publications</em></strong>\u2019 social media reception.
      Filters are implemented to explore the data more flexibly, including different
      <strong><em>selection of measures</em></strong>, <strong><em>time periods</em></strong>,
      <strong><em>data source choice,</em></strong> and <strong><em>wildcard match
      filter</em></strong> to select publications including a specific keyword.</p><p>In
      the <strong>trend analysis</strong> dashboard, the different dates refer to
      the <em>post date</em> of each of the altmetric events considered (e.g., news
      mentions, blogs citations, tweets, etc.). For each specific date, the number
      of publications and social media events happening on that date are presented
      in the dashboard. You also have the option to select the social media source
      to be plotted, as well as the period of monitoring, and the different databases
      that are considered in the COVID-19 research related database <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/cwts_covid\"
      target=\"_blank\">maintained at CWTS</a>. </p><p>The <strong>explore publications</strong>
      dashboard allows for multiple analytical visualizations, by combining each time
      two different social media metrics, and allowing the same filtering options
      as above. It is also possible to identify publications with given title keywords,
      just by typing them (without any wildcard) in the <em>Filter </em>option of
      the dashboard and pressing <em>Enter</em>. The aim of this dashboard is to provide
      an exploratory tool that can help identify publications with different types
      of online reception (e.g., tweets vs. news), being able to characterize them

      2)&nbsp;is observed at the publication level (following the option \u201CExplore
      Publications\u201D). We have selected publications containing the term \u201Chydroxychloroquine\u201D
      in their titles. It is possible to see how many of these publications have received
      substantial attention on Twitter, both in terms of original tweets and retweets
      (as well as in news media, measured by the size of the circles). Publications
      that have been recommended at least once in F1000Prime during the period selected
      are highlighted in red.&nbsp;There is a publication on the top right side of
      the graph with a very high volume of tweeting \r\nactivity as well as reception
      in the news. This is a recent publication retracted in the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext\"
      target=\"_blank\">Lancet</a> due to the inability to replicate its results and

      target=\"_blank\">Altmetric</a> (and colored red in Figure 2).&nbsp;This example
      illustrates how social media metrics can play an \r\ninteresting role in identifying
      potential publication issues. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RensonAudrey/status/1263935028913934337\"

      Conferences and Workshops are the most prominent events around the world on
      altmetrics, and have been held annually at different locations since 2014. The
      Altmetrics Conference focuses on a wider target audience, such as librarians,
      publishers, researchers and several altmetrics data aggregators and providers.
      The conference aims to give attendees a chance to hear practical applications
      of altmetrics data, learn from what others are doing, and discuss the potential
      challenges and opportunities that these data bring to their organisations. </p><p>The
      Altmetrics Workshop takes place together with the conference, after having had
      workshops at the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/conference/websci\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer\">ACM Web Science Conferences</a> in 2012 and 2014. The workshop
      series sets the focus on researchers to discuss work in progress on altmetrics
      research. In contrast to the conference, submissions to the workshop are also
      peer reviewed, and extended abstracts are published on the workshop website
      (e.g. <a href=\"http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The

      July 2019, I joined CWTS for a one-year research stay. The lockdown due to COVID-19
      changed my situation as a visiting researcher quite a bit. While virtual ways
      of working could make up for some of the constraints experienced, I had to think:
      what might be the effects on academic networking?</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>In July 2019, I came to Leiden
      in the Netherlands for a one-year research visit at CWTS. This was possible
      thanks to a grant by the Graduate Students Study Abroad Program from the Ministry
      of Science and Technology (MOST) in Taiwan. This grant supports domestic doctoral
      students to have a research stay abroad. My time in the Netherlands was spent
      on pursuing two goals: (1) to conduct my PhD research project in the topic of
      open access (OA) publishing, combining a survey and bibliometrics approach and
      studying the policy development in European countries, and (2) to visit as many
      places as possible to broaden my research horizon. </p><p>I still remember why
      I chose the Netherlands. First of all, CWTS is an excellent research institution
      in the area of scientometrics and research policy including OA studies, so I
      could use this opportunity to learn from experts in the field. Second, CWTS
      has a long history with the institute where I work in Taiwan, the <a href=\"https://www.stpi.narl.org.tw/indexEn.htm\">Science
      & Technology Policy Research and Information Center (STPI)</a>. Both CWTS and
      STPI had conducted some research projects together almost twenty years ago,
      but somehow the connection was lost for a while. We have similar missions and
      research agendas, and I believe my research stay can help to revive this relationship
      and to create more future collaboration opportunities. Third, the Netherlands
      is located  centrally in Western Europe, and there are many important research
      institutes here. I was looking forward to visiting many places to exchange research
      ideas and have discussions. Particularly,  many academic conferences or workshops
      are organized by European research institutes or other stakeholders in research
      policy on an annual basis. In the past, I attended these activities one or two
      times a year, and every time I needed to find financial support to cover the
      travel expenses. If I could not find financial support, I only could use hashtags
      to follow the latest discussions via Twitter to know what was discussed during
      those conferences. This definitely lacks the opportunity to network with the
      academic community. Hence, once I knew that I would have this chance to stay
      one-year as a visiting researcher in Europe, I got very excited. At this point,
      though, I could not yet foresee how things would unfold\u2026</p><p><strong>Before
      the lockdown</strong><br>In the first six months of my research stay, I tried
      to seize any possible opportunity for traveling. Last August, I visited a number
      of organisations in the United Kingdom to learn about the development of OA
      in the UK: the Wellcome Trust, <a href=\"https://www.jisc.ac.uk/open-access\">Jisc</a>,
      the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) by Clarivate Analytics, and Loughborough
      University to obtain different perspectives on this issue from different stakeholders.
      In the first week of September, I went to Rome, Italy to attend the <a href=\"https://www.issi2019.org/\">17th
      International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and
      Informetrics (ISSI)</a> as well as the doctoral forum of the conference. This
      was my first time to attend an ISSI conference and I was very thrilled to see
      many scholars and peers there. Then, I was invited to go to London to attend
      the <a href=\"http://researchonresearch.org/rori-lanches\">launch event</a>
      of the Research on Research Institute (RoRI). It was a great opportunity to
      observe how a new research agenda is formed. Participating in such a big event
      gave me the chance to get to know more people in the field and think about how
      to connect this academic community with our institute in Taiwan in the future.
      During those events, I couldn't help but to think that all these things could
      not have happened if I had not come to Europe to do my research. Moreover, I
      started to worry about whether the degree of connection with Europe could be
      decreasing more or less after I had gone back home. How should I maintain the
      connections? How should I find more financial support to let me have the opportunity
      to fly to Europe to attend the academic activities here?<strong><br><br>After
      the lockdown</strong><br>Suddenly, my upcoming trips were forced to be cancelled
      due to the outbreak of COVID-19. I was supposed to attend the <a href=\"http://www.peere.org/conference/\">PEERE
      Conference on Peer Review</a> in March and give a talk at the German Centre
      for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) in April. Not to mention
      that I also had plans to visit more research institutes in Europe in the second
      half year of my research stay. The only event that I could still attend in person
      was the LIS-Bibliometrics conference organized by Leeds University in early
      March, just before the lockdown.<br><br>It seems that my identity as a \u201Cvisiting
      researcher\u201D has less meaning now. I am the \u201Cwork-from-home\u201D researcher
      now. To be honest, it is a little disappointing for me. I did not expect this
      situation happening at all. <br><br>However, I still feel grateful with all
      the arrangements made at CWTS and Leiden University. Thanks to the infrastructure
      of the database and the remote connection, I can access the database remotely.
      We still have the regular group and individual meetings. All the Friday afternoon
      research seminars remained to take place, in an online form however. One day,
      I woken up to the realization that there is a bright side of this lockdown as
      well, similar to what <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-bright-side-of-the-lockdown-the-experience-of-conducting-phd-studies-remotely\">my
      colleague Eleonora Dagiene said</a> in her blog post. Maybe, when I go back
      to Taiwan, I can still use this online channel to have discussions with my colleagues
      at CWTS, and I still can join research seminars on Friday afternoons and feel
      inspired. The only thing that I will need to overcome is the different time
      zone.<br><br>Moreover, many courses or lectures are shifting to the online version.
      For example, the <a href=\"https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fhse/dsoc/research_areas/education_society/lecture_series_2020_science_of_science_in_the_spotlight\">lecture
      series of Science of Science</a> organized by University of Luxembourg invites
      many outstanding scholars to give a talk: the presenters are from all over the
      world, as are the participants. I feel excited about all these new opportunities
      and connections. <strong><br><br>Reflections</strong><br>Nevertheless, I have
      somewhat mixed feelings about this. Academic communication and interaction will
      have changed once the lockdowns are removed again. On the one hand, the boundary
      of geography might disappear. All these conferences, workshops, and seminars
      perhaps will continue to take place virtually. This will allow people from distant
      countries to join these activities without having to consider timely or budgetary
      limits. Those who always had to go on many international business trips may
      have more time to spend with their families instead of on travelling. Moreover,
      it is really helpful for carbon reduction.<br><br>However, all the information
      about online lectures or seminars that I have obtained so far is provided by
      the acquaintances I made during conferences. This means that the connections
      and information exchange we are enjoying now are somehow based on the interactions
      we had in the past. Without meeting each other physically anymore, though, will
      we still get new such opportunities during virtual meetings? I doubt it.<br><br>This
      pandemic makes us re-think the meaning of globalization in academia. If online
      courses and virtual conferences become the future norm, will it increase or
      decrease the degree of scientific collaboration? Although I personally prefer
      having traditional face-to-face discussions, I do benefit from the online discussions.
      However, I am wondering whether this virtual way of working will actually contribute
      to increasing access to academic knowledge for those from developing countries.
      While researchers from developing countries may not need to worry about the
      issue of affordability of traveling or living abroad, new disparities might
      be created as well. Those could be an immediate consequence of less face-to-face
      connection, confining possibilities for enlarging one\u2019s academic network.
      Would this mean that we will have smaller circles in academia in the future?
      I do hope that this will not be the case, and that we will find ways for inspiring
      (new) collaborations regardless of more virtual interactions.</p><p></p>\n\n

      necessity of communicating reliable and understandable scientific knowledge
      around the disease. In this situation, the complexity of the scientific language
      may not necessarily be accessible to the broader public. This makes it necessary
      to have communicators and scientists able to translate the implications of scientific
      work for our everyday lives. <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The

      more journalistic style. These authors need to have proven expertise in the
      range of topics they are writing about. Articles can be directly accessed on
      the platform for free, but may also be republished by other news outlets. This
      makes <em>The Conversation</em> a unique open platform for discovering and more

      \u201C<em>Coronavirus\u201D</em>, or \u201C<em>SARS-COV-2\u201D</em> in the
      article keywords. This resulted in a total of 1,979 articles. Figure 1 compares
      the number of articles overall to the number of articles about COVID-19. The
      uptake of articles on COVID-19 is quite remarkable. In the later weeks of March
      and of early April, more than half of the articles have directly referred to
      the disease.<span class=\"caption\"></span><em><span class=\"caption\"></span></em><em><span

      Time frame: Jan 01-Apr 19, 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>This large volume of
      articles referring to COVID-19 turns <em>The Conversation</em>\r\ninto a unique
      source for studying the broader dissemination and impact \r\nof research conducted
      in the context of the disease. This made us \r\nwonder: <strong>What are the
      most prominent topics in the discussion of COVID-19 that have been put forward
      in <em>The Conversation</em>? </strong></p><p>Exploring the words in the full
      texts of articles referring to \r\nCOVID-19, we took into account articles in
      English and focussed on two \r\nregional editions: The UK (354 articles), and
      Africa (108 articles). \r\nBased on the terms extracted, we created term maps
      with the help of <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer</a>.\r\n
      Visualizations made with this software reveal the connectedness of \r\nterms:
      The distance of two terms in the visualization represents how \r\noften they
      co-occur in articles. On the other hand, the overall presence\r\n of a term
      is represented by the size of its label. Furthermore, \r\nVOSviewer groups terms
      into thematic clusters. </p><p>What did we find? Figure 2 shows a visualization
      of all terms from the UK subset.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/UK_Figure_2_nolines_downsized.png\"

      clusters become apparent in the UK edition. Starting with the green cluster
      on the left, we find terms related to the virologic and epidemiologic aspects
      of COVID-19 (see figure 3), including terms like \u201Cinfection\u201D, \u201Cpatient\u201D,
      or \u201Cimmunity\u201D.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_3_1200.png\"

      &amp; epidemiological cluster&#039;, UK edition.\uFEFF</figcaption></figure><p>The
      blue cluster on the right is concerned with the economic impact of COVID-19
      and the national lock-down \u2013 see figure 4; it includes terms such as \u201Cbusiness\u201D,
      \u201Cmoney\u201D, or \u201Ceconomy\u201D.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_4_blue_1200.png\"

      cluster&#039;, UK edition. \uFEFF</figcaption></figure><p>Spread in between
      the blue and the green cluster is the yellow one \u2013 which may be related
      to the political discourse around COVID-19 (see figure 5), with terms such as
      \u201Cgovernance\u201D, \u201Cleader\u201D, and \u201Cparty\u201D.</p><figure><img

      UK edition.\uFEFF</figcaption></figure><p>This placement of the \u2018political
      cluster' between the other clusters seems quite plausible, given the role of
      politics as a broker between the medical and clinical necessities required due
      to the disease, and the ensuing socio-economic implications. Finally, the red
      cluster at the top of the map contains terms that are related to the more social
      aspects of COVID-19 and the effects of the lock-down on people (see figure 6),
      with terms such as \u201Cfriend\u201D, \u201Cinteraction\u201D, or \u201Cmental
      health\u201D.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_6_1200.png\"

      </em>the picture evident with the UK changes when conducting the same analysis
      for the African edition of <em>The Conversation</em> (see figure 7).</p><figure><img

      COVID-19 related articles in the African edition of &#039;The Conversation&#039;.</figcaption></figure><p>Here,
      we also find four clusters, but the cluster focusing more on the disease itself
      (in red, on the left, figure 8) and the economic cluster (in green, on the right,
      figure 9) are more dominant than in the case of the UK.<br></p><figure><img

      alt=\"Figure 8 Africa red\"><figcaption>Figure 8. Stand-alone image of the &#039;disease
      cluster&#039;, African edition.</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the more
      social aspects of the measures taken against COVID-19 are more strongly interwoven
      into the economic terms (see figure 9) than is the case with the UK, where the
      social aspects formed into a cluster of its own.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_9_green.png\"
      alt=\"Figure 9 green\"><figcaption>Figure 9. Stand-alone image of the &#039;economic
      cluster&#039;, African edition.\uFEFF</figcaption></figure><p>One should keep
      in mind, though, that the African edition has issued \r\nfewer articles than
      the UK edition in the time period observed. Thus, \r\nthe results described
      may (also) be artifacts of the activity of the \r\ndifferent editions.</p><p>Finally,
      we can also inspect when which terms were most prominent \r\nover time (see
      figure 10). While terms directly related to COVID-19 and \r\nits outbreak dominated
      earlier this year, we observe that the focus has \r\nlater on shifted to the
      socio-economic implications.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_10_time.png\"

      colours indicate that the average publication day in 2020 on which a term has
      occurred in articles has been earlier; lighter colours indicate more recent
      days. African edition.\uFEFF</figcaption></figure><p>What can we learn from
      all this? The different clusters that became apparent in the analysis show that
      COVID-19 brings about challenges in different contexts \u2013 and it shows:
      these challenges found their way into a science-oriented discussion, at least
      in <em>The Conversation</em>. Furthermore, the differences in the coverage of
      the UK and the African edition call attention to account for the different needs
      raised by different communities in the wake of the pandemic. We plan to further
      investigate this, possibly spotting some of the hot/cold topics that may become
      apparent when taking different geographical perspectives. Finally, the dimension
      of time may further provide insights into the development of the discussion.</p><p>We
      believe this inquiry holds value in two ways: First, we learn about the medium
      <em>The Conversation</em> itself. Which topics are covered, how does it react
      to, adopt and contribute to the ongoing scientific discussion around COVID-19?
      Such an understanding could constitute a powerful use case for contemporary
      science communication. Then, novel perspectives on science (as, e.g., disseminated
      around COVID-19) may be expected as well: As far as <em>The Conversation</em>
      articles include references to scientific publications, we may learn more about
      these studies, given how they are contextualized here. But that is up to another
      blog post\u2026</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Jonathan

      week CWTS researchers Martijn Visser, Nees Jan van Eck, and Ludo Waltman published
      the paper &#039;Large-scale comparison of bibliographic data sources: Scopus,
      Web of Science, Dimensions, Crossref, and Microsoft Academic&#039;. In this
      post, the authors answer ten questions about their work.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p><em>Your <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10732\"
      target=\"_blank\">paper</a> is based on a huge amount of data. How did you manage
      to get access to so much data?</em></p><p>In the internal database system of
      CWTS, we have access to the raw data of Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions,
      Crossref, and Microsoft Academic. CWTS is probably the only center in the world
      that has access to all this data, so we are in a unique position to compare
      the different data sources. Getting access to data from Crossref and Microsoft
      Academic is easy, since their data is openly available. Anyone can get access
      to their data. In the case of Scopus and Dimensions, CWTS is in the fortunate
      situation to receive their raw data for free for research purposes. (Note that
      Scopus and Dimensions both offer possibilities to scientometric researchers
      to get free access to their data. See <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/icsr/icsrlab\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> for Scopus and <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/scientometric-research/\"
      target=\"_blank\">here</a> for Dimensions.) Web of Science is the only data
      source for which we pay. CWTS has a paid license that enables us to use Web
      of Science data in our research.</p><p><em>Why don't you have access to the
      full Web of Science database?</em></p><p><a href=\"https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a> comprises a number of different citation
      indices. The Web of Science license of CWTS covers the Science Citation Index
      Expanded, the Social Sciences Citation Index, the Arts & Humanities Citation
      Index, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index. It doesn\u2019t cover
      other citation indices, such as the Emerging Sources Citation Index and the
      Book Citation Index. To get access to these citation indices, CWTS would have
      to pay more to Clarivate Analytics, the producer of Web of Science. For future
      comparative analyses of bibliographic data sources, we hope that Clarivate is
      willing to grant us free access to the full Web of Science database.</p><p><em>In
      addition to scientific documents, Dimensions also covers grants, data sets,
      clinical trials, patents, and policy documents. Why didn\u2019t you include
      this content in your analysis?</em></p><p>The focus of our analysis is on scientific
      documents. While we recognize the value of other types of content, this content
      falls outside the scope of our analysis.</p><p><em>Why didn\u2019t you include
      Google Scholar, OpenCitations, and the Lens in your analysis?</em></p><p>Google
      Scholar was not be included because data at the scale required for our analysis
      is impossible to obtain from Google Scholar. We refer to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14329\"
      target=\"_blank\">recent work</a> by Alberto Mart\xEDn-Mart\xEDn and colleagues
      for a comparison of Google Scholar with other data sources. <a href=\"http://opencitations.net/\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenCitations</a> currently obtains most of its data from
      Crossref. For the <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lens</a>,
      our understanding is that most of the data is obtained from Microsoft Academic.
      Since Crossref and Microsoft Academic are included in our analysis, the added
      value of including OpenCitations and the Lens seems limited. However, this is
      likely to change in the future, when OpenCitations and the Lens become more
      independent data sources. In future analyses, OpenCitations, the Lens, and others,
      such as the <a href=\"https://www.openaire.eu/blogs/the-openaire-research-graph\"
      target=\"_blank\">OpenAIRE Research Graph</a>, definitely deserve close attention.</p><p><em>In
      your paper, you analyze documents published in the period 2008-2017. Why didn't
      you include more recent documents in your analysis?</em></p><p>Processing all
      data required for our analysis was a huge effort that took a lot of time. The
      first steps of the analysis were taken in 2018. This explains why documents
      from the most recent years are not included.</p><p><em>In your paper, you acknowledge
      feedback from the various data providers. How much influence did they have on
      your work?</em></p><p>We invited all data providers to offer feedback on an
      earlier draft of our paper. This is a standard policy of CWTS for studies in
      which we analyze and compare scientometric data sources. By inviting data providers
      to give feedback, we offer them the opportunity to clarify misunderstandings
      and misinterpretations and we improve the quality of our work. Our paper has
      benefited significantly from the feedback received from data providers. The
      interpretation of our findings has become more nuanced, and a number of ambiguities
      have been resolved. Of course we make sure that data providers don\u2019t influence
      our work in problematic ways. Of the comments made by data providers, we use
      the ones that we agree with to improve our paper. We disregard comments that
      we do not agree with.</p><p><em>You report a number of competing interests in
      your paper. Are you sufficiently independent?</em></p><p>As reported in our
      paper, CWTS has commercial relationships with a number of data providers. However,
      we believe this has had no influence on our paper. We have been able to work
      in a completely independent way.</p><p><em>CWTS supports the Initiative for
      Open Citations (I4OC). What do we learn from your paper about the successfulness
      of this initiative?</em></p><p>CWTS indeed supports <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/news?article=n-r2r244\">I4OC</a>,
      an initiative that aims to convince publishers to make the reference lists of
      articles in their journals openly available in Crossref. The figure shown below,
      taken from our paper, shows that I4OC has only partly been successful. While
      Web of Science, Dimensions, and Microsoft Academic have a large overlap with
      Scopus in terms of citation links, Crossref can be used to obtain only 42% of
      the citation links in Scopus (for citing and cited documents that are indexed
      both in Scopus and in Crossref). This is partly due to publishers that do not
      deposit reference lists in Crossref. It is also partly caused by publishers
      such as ACS, Elsevier, and IEEE that do deposit reference lists in Crossref
      but that choose not to make these reference lists openly available.</p><div

      analysis presented in your paper is on the number of documents covered by the
      different bibliographic data sources. Is this the right way of comparing data
      sources?</em></p><p>In our paper, we focus on the coverage of bibliographic
      data sources and the quality of citation links. Coverage is an important aspect
      in a comparison of bibliographic data sources. However, as we acknowledge in
      our paper, there are many other important aspects as well, such as the completeness
      and accuracy of the data, the speed of updating, the way in which the data is
      made available (e.g., web interfaces, APIs, data dumps), and the conditions
      under which the data can be used (e.g., paid or free, with or without restrictions
      on reuse). Some of these aspects were discussed in a recent <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_e_00026\"
      target=\"_blank\">special issue</a> of <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em>.</p><p><em>Based
      on your work, which bibliographic data source do you recommend to use?</em></p><p>It
      is not possible to provide a general recommendation. Each data source has pros
      and cons. Which data source can best be used needs to be decided on a case-by-case
      basis. Comprehensiveness and selectivity often play a key role in such a decision.
      On the one hand, we like the focus of Dimensions and Microsoft Academic on comprehensiveness.
      However, sometimes there is a need to be selective, and therefore we believe
      there is value in filters such as those provided by Scopus and Web of Science.
      A key question for any data source is how a comprehensive coverage of the scientific
      literature can be combined with a flexible set of filters that enable users
      to make selections of the literature.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Martijn

      target=\"_blank\">Yesterday it was announced</a>\r\nthat the Association of
      Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU), the Netherlands Federation of University
      Medical Centres (NFU), the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and Elsevier have reached
      a national deal that includes Open Access publishing and reading services. The
      deal had been long in the making, and <a href=\"https://www.scienceguide.nl/2017/03/leaked-elsevier-contract-reveals-pushback/\"
      target=\"_blank\">the road was bumpy</a>. An important feature of the deal is
      that it moves beyond Open Access: it is also an agreement about the joint development
      of new research intelligence services. The bundling of Open Access and data
      services was <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/nl_NL/nieuwsbericht/nieuwsbericht/552-dutch-research-institutions-and-elsevier-reach-framework-agreement.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">formally announced in December</a>, but the <a href=\"https://www.scienceguide.nl/2019/11/leaked-document-on-elsevier-negotiations-sparks-controversy/\"
      target=\"_blank\">news leaked a month earlier</a>. The contract with Elsevier
      has been made <a href=\"https://vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/Signed%20UKB%20Elsevier%20SD%202020-2024%20agreement.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">publicly available</a>, except for the financial agreements
      made.<br></p><p>Because of this link between access and research intelligence
      services, the VSNU, NFU and NWO installed an expert Taskforce at the beginning
      of 2020 to \u201Caddress issues around the responsible use of research information
      and the role of commercial third-party providers in particular.\u201D I am a
      member of the Taskforce. The relevance of the Taskforce is explained <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Open%20access/Engelstalige%20samenvatting%20opdracht%20werkgroep.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">in our assignment</a>:</p><p><em>\u201CThere is an emerging
      market for third party providers offering services to satisfy the growing demand
      for research information and evaluation. Using large scale data collection,
      aggregation and analysis, these services provide new prospects for assisted
      decision making on, for example: - funding opportunities, - publishing venues,
      - identifying upcoming research fields, - alternative metrics. As critical functions
      of the scholarly enterprise become increasingly dependent on such services,
      it is critical that the academy itself carefully considers risks involved in
      becoming too dependent on specific market players and their tightly integrated
      solutions. The increasing interwovenness of information about research (research
      intelligence) and research itself raises a number of challenging issues both
      for users and for producers of this information.\u201D</em></p><p>Two important
      aims of the Taskforce are to:</p><ul><li>Establish a set of terms and conditions
      under which metadata of public research output can be (re)used and enriched
      by public and private organizations, in accordance with research ethics and
      public values and avoiding undesired network or platform effects</li><li>Describe
      the concept of an Open Knowledge Base (OKB), in which an open infrastructure
      is developed in cooperation with private parties for the responsible management
      of research information and data, consistent with Dutch Open Science goals</li></ul><p>An
      <a href=\"https://vsnu.nl/nl_NL/nieuwsbericht/nieuwsbericht/596-consultation-on-guiding-principles-on-management-of-research-information-and-data.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">open consultation</a> is currently underway on the <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/Guiding%20Principles%20on%20Management%20of%20Research%20Information%20and%20Data_11May.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Guiding Principles</a> the Taskforce formulated for collaboration
      between Dutch research institutions and third-party organizations in developing
      new services based on (meta)data use. We have formulated principles on 1) Ownership
      of (meta)data; 2) Enduring access; 3) Trusted and transparent provenance; 4)
      Interoperability as part of community owned governance; 5) Open collaboration
      with the market; and 6) Community owned governance. These principles have also
      been offered to the steering committee of VSNU, NFU and NWO, who were responsible
      for the negotiations with Elsevier. </p><p><strong>In cash, or in kind?</strong></p><p>So
      what exactly does Elsevier get with this deal? And how does the deal hold up
      when compared to our Guiding Principles?</p><p>To begin with, it is definitely
      laudable that Elsevier committed to a set of collaboration principles, including
      data ownership (researchers and/or institutions own their own research data),
      interoperability, and institutional discretion on the use of the services. But
      there is also cause for concern.</p><p>The contract mentions examples of potential
      pilots to develop research intelligence services. The first potential pilot,
      for example, aims to \u201C[i]mprove findability and visibility of NL research
      outputs by aggregating and deduplicating separate CRIS systems into a Pure Community
      module available to all institutions which can serve as a building block to
      a NL open knowledge base.\u201D (p. 103)</p><p>As part of a community-owned
      Open Knowledge Base, such a pilot does not seem acceptable to me. I can well
      imagine the interest research institutions may have in such a pilot; an enrichment
      of metadata is interesting for them. But it would basically let a public infrastructure
      be controlled by Elsevier modules by building them in from the start. The research
      institutions should first carefully consider whether or not a pilot with a Pure
      Community Module is truly in line with Dutch Open Science goals. They should
      also more carefully consider whether or not this pilot would undermine plans
      for a community-owned OKB.</p><p>There is a simple solution though. This is
      to disconnect the Pure Community Module from the contract for now. Subsequently,
      a tender could be issued for a Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) module
      that does something similar, and that can also process (meta) data from other
      sources. Elsevier can then tender for this contract. This would also give research
      institutions the opportunity to make an inventory of what alternatives are currently
      available for the Pure Community Module. If Elsevier wins the tender and their
      proposal is implemented, it will have been properly weighed against alternatives.</p><p><em>A
      crucial difference is that Elsevier is then paid in cash for their services,
      and not in \u201Ckind\u201D by giving them an insurmountable competitive advantage
      in terms of access to research intelligence. This is a very important point
      of principle.</em></p><p><strong>Enduring access   </strong></p><p>All the pilots
      that Elsevier wants to commit to as well as the OKB itself aim to establish
      relationships between items, mainly by linking metadata. The <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/Guiding%20Principles%20on%20Management%20of%20Research%20Information%20and%20Data_11May.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Guiding Principles</a> of our Taskforce stipulate that universities
      and other relevant institutions must have access to Dutch research information
      (metadata), including \"derived\" information. Therefore, a very important point
      is whether sustainable access is negotiated to relationships between entities
      established by third parties, in this case Elsevier. If I read the negotiation
      agreement carefully, I wonder if this is the case. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LudoWaltman/status/1262826004835373056\"
      target=\"_blank\">Will Elsevier deposit proper metadata to Crossref</a>? Will
      this metadata be made fully open, also in the case of <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\">citation data</a>?</p><p><strong>Limited financial means</strong></p><p>This
      agreement will obviously give Elsevier a competitive edge, because they have
      already secured a number of pilots. And this agreement also implies that universities
      will have less money left for issuing contracts to other parties. The financial
      ramifications are especially relevant now that we are confronted with major
      economic consequences as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should the competitive
      advantage be seen as a compensation for Elsevier\u2019s willingness to engage
      in a read and publish deal? I am not persuaded. It would have been far more
      preferable if the research institutions would have first formulated general
      principles for collaboration with private parties, and only then had started
      to engage in projects and look for third-party interest. It seems sensible to
      me to stick to such a model as much as possible, for example by decoupling certain
      projects from the agreement and putting them into a general tender. In my view,
      funders would do well to also consider this model for the Funder Information
      pilot mentioned in the agreement, which has the stated aim to \u201Clink NL
      research outputs to grants and funders (EC, ERC, NWO, RVO, ZonMw), to allow
      for improved tracking / assessment of impact of funded research.\u201D Here,
      too, it is crucial to avoid vendor lock-in. And of course, Elsevier should be
      given the opportunity to apply for these tenders. The option of issuing a tender
      per pilot has been left open in the contract with Elsevier.</p><p><strong>Value-extraction
      from public-sector information</strong></p><p>It is evident that Elsevier has
      quite a lot to gain from this deal. What is in store for them is a unique research
      intelligence infrastructure, because it is not only a national-level arrangement,
      but on top of that, the information that goes in is also validated by the institutes
      and research funders themselves. Obviously, Elsevier wants to manage a wide
      range of research intelligence to offer analyses from the perspectives of multiple
      stakeholders. Therefore, the company aims to establish a comprehensive linkage
      of metadata related to institutions, researchers, output, funding, and other
      resources. The Open Knowledge Base that the research institutions are themselves
      considering has similar ambitions. What remains to be seen is whether our research
      institutions are willing and able to <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/574?rss%253D1=\"
      target=\"_blank\">\u2018step up to invest in home-grown research infrastructures\u2019</a>.
      It is also an open question whether Elsevier systems will be made open and inclusive
      enough to comply with the Guiding Principles we formulated on behalf of the
      research institutions. I am not persuaded by the contract, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahderijcke/status/1190610725250764800\"
      target=\"_blank\">still find it disconcerting</a> that this deal may effectively
      transfer crucial means to influence Dutch science policy to a monopolistic private
      enterprise.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Sarah

      Covid-19 forcing university staff to work from home, there is ample opportunity
      for rethinking all the commuting we were doing in \u2018normal&#039; times.
      However, staying all at home is not so enjoyable, either. Could there be an
      alternative?</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>This
      blogpost is a follow-up of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/pre-covid-19-workshop-on-virtual-meetings-and-conferences\"
      target=\"_blank\">post by Carole de Bordes</a>. She discusses a pre-covid19
      workshop she attended on virtual meetings and conferences.</p><p>Due to the
      Covid-19 crisis, we are currently experiencing a new way of working at CWTS.
      All staff needs to work from home. And besides the difficulties some colleagues
      are facing in this transition because of their home situations, most of the
      normal work could be taken up quite fast again. The main factor is the type
      of work we do, of course. A university research institute with hardly any teaching
      tasks can manage almost all things remotely. On top of that, we have excellent
      ICT facilities and staff to guide us in this process.</p><p>In early April 2020,
      <a href=\"https://www.volkskrant.nl/gs-bd06f4f5\" target=\"_blank\">the Dutch
      prime minister warned us that it will be a long way back to the life before
      the outbreak</a>. This statement, in particular, made me think about the way
      CWTS may adapt to this situation. We are able to deal with the current situation,
      but would we be fit to enter a new way of working in the longer term? On the
      other hand, I actually consider the current course of affairs to hold an opportunity.
      </p><p>At present, all CWTS staff works from home. The university has appropriate
      facilities for almost all of us to stay in our homes and do the job we are supposed
      to do. We access data from a distance, we have online meetings and online conferences,
      we can write and share texts, etc. In that sense, we hardly need an office in
      Leiden. Commuting has become obsolete.</p><p>Does this mean we can continue
      in this way once the crisis is over? Is working from home the new \u2018normal\u2019
      to us? Obviously not. For many of us, working from home is complicated, due
      to housing issues. You don\u2019t want to work all the time in the place where
      you eat, watch television, or sleep. And maybe even more importantly, we miss
      the social contacts in real life. CWTS caf\xE9 at 10 AM staring at a screen
      does not make up for that.</p><p>But there is an alternative that deserves consideration.
      In 1999, I defended <a href=\"https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/38308\"
      target=\"_blank\">my PhD thesis in Leiden</a>.\r\nIn the Netherlands, PhD candidates
      are supposed to add a separate leaflet to their dissertation which includes
      10 theses (<em>stellingen </em>in Dutch), relating to the subject or the candidate.
      The list I handed in at the time included one particular thesis, the last one,
      which has remained unnoticed to many but may hint to the opportunity for a new
      \u2018normal\u2019.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/ed_thesis.png\"
      alt=\"Ed thesis\"></figure><h3>Reducing commuting issues by traveling less</h3><p>The
      snapshot above shows the bottom of the list of theses. The last one, number
      10, states (in English):&nbsp;</p><p><em>The solution for traffic jams in the
      Netherlands can only be reached if we are able to make a distinction between
      colleagues within the organization and those in one\u2019s working place</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In
      other words: to reduce the problem of traffic jams, we should have offices near
      staff members\u2019 residences, hosting people from different organizations
      or companies. Such offices are what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/pre-covid-19-workshop-on-virtual-meetings-and-conferences\">my
      colleague Carole de Bordes has referred to as (meeting) hubs</a>. With people
      living in many other places than Leiden, we could have such hubs. This would
      significantly reduce the commuting of our staff. We would not only contribute
      to less contact with fellow travelers but also save many, many hours sitting
      in a train (or car). I am not saying that traveling time is lost time but after
      more than thirty years of commuting between Utrecht and Leiden, I do consider
      over 12,000 hours a bit silly. Thinking of all the things I could have done
      during that time\u2026 </p><p>On top of that, it will be easier to accommodate
      the 1.5-meter distance policy with fewer people in the office at the same time.</p><h3>What
      is the proposition?</h3><p>For instance, currently, five CWTS staff members
      live in Utrecht. They could take up quarters in an office with a proper infrastructure
      during the week, and travel only to Leiden when they need to be there physically.
      Many meetings and talks could be done via online-conferencing. For the rest,
      meeting in these hubs would offer the possibility of not having to work from
      our living rooms or bedrooms anymore and enable us to socialize with colleagues.
      In fact, the one thing we are most desperately missing at the moment is meeting
      colleagues in person during breaks and in the hall, all those informal encounters.
      With hubs in Utrecht, Amsterdam or Rotterdam, though, this would be covered.
      We could cover the extra costs of having these hubs by saving traveling costs
      or with support from the faculty, which will also save expenses when the building
      is used less. Considering the lack of office space at the university, this would
      be beneficial as well.</p><p>Finally, the above proposition will lead to a more
      convenient way of working. This will contribute to happiness. And happiness
      is the key value to success, as stated in thesis number 9:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Money
      does not make [you] happy. It is happiness that makes money.</em></p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ed

      \                                               <p>For years I had been moving
      towards a long-cherished dream: pursuing a PhD. In my academic publishing role,
      the <a href=\"http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto</a>,
      <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden Ranking</a>,
      and <a href=\"https://www.journalindicators.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CWTS journal
      indicators</a> had played an important part. The Centre for Science and Technology
      Studies (<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">CWTS</a>), seemed
      the most suitable place. However, I was wondering if this would be possible
      for a middle-aged mother of four living in a small Eastern European country.</p><p>I
      know that if you want to be accepted, you should express your willingness first.
      So, after several emails and conversations with <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/sarah-de-rijcke\"
      target=\"_blank\">Sarah de Rijcke</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/ludo-waltman\"
      target=\"_blank\">Ludo Waltman</a>, it was agreed that I could do a PhD with
      remote supervision by Ludo Waltman and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/vincent-lariviere\"
      target=\"_blank\">Vincent Larivi\xE8re</a>.</p><h3>Remote studies before the
      pandemic</h3><p>When my journey as a PhD candidate started in November 2018,
      Leiden University was already prepared well for distance learning. I was satisfied
      and comfortable with the remote workspace provided by the CWTS team, the university
      library catalogues, and monthly Skype meetings with my supervisor Ludo Waltman.
      </p><p>The library is the heart of any university, and the <a href=\"https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/using-the-library/remote-access\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden University Library</a> exceeded my expectations. Not
      only because of the richness of e-journals, databases and e-book <a href=\"https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/using-the-library/remote-access\"
      target=\"_blank\">collections</a>, but also because of features implemented
      by the smart and ever helpful librarians. The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leiden-search-assistant/dillijfbjhoiokfgjbngplcfggkkdnbn\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Search Assistant plugin</a> allows you to search the
      Leiden University library catalogue, Web of Science, Google Scholar, WorldCat,
      and PubMed instantly, without having to navigate to these respective websites
      first. The browser extension \u2018UBL Get Access\u2019 provides immediate access
      to subscribed scholarly articles and e-books.</p><p>I feel profoundly grateful
      to Ludo Waltman, a generous and supportive supervisor. His calm guidance helps
      me steer my intended research projects. Ludo treats me like a colleague, gives
      me self-determination, and tolerates my limitations, spending hours reading
      my drafts, discussing, and showing better ways to communicate the findings.
      </p><p>The Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) offers a range of
      exciting possibilities for developing various skills in scientometrics. Remote
      access and newsletters keep me in touch. But, deep inside, I knew I had not
      fully explored many possibilities the university offered. </p><p>Quarterly trips
      to Leiden for several days each made remote studies more pleasant, and discussions
      in person foster the learning process and ongoing research. Also, PhD coordinator
      at CWTS <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/inge-van-der-weijden\" target=\"_blank\">Inge
      van der Weijden</a>\r\ntalked to me about research projects and the progress
      in my studies. I chatted with other PhD candidates. When I asked <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/wout-lamers\"
      target=\"_blank\">Wout Lamers</a> advice on learning Python, he emailed me a
      comprehensive list of step-by-step suggestions. I realised that every visit
      to CWTS and in-person meeting accelerated my progress. Still, these short visits
      did not coincide with meetings of the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/research-groups/quantitative-science-studies\"
      target=\"_blank\">Quantitative Science Studies</a> group I belong to. </p><p>Meanwhile,
      attendance at university events such as<a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2019/06/190620-inaugural-lecture-ludo-waltman\"
      target=\"_blank\"> The Inaugural Lecture by Ludo Waltman</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2019/11/phd-career-event\"
      target=\"_blank\">Life after the PhD</a> made me feel a fierce pride in the
      university traditions. </p><p>Thus, after the first year, I decided to physically
      visit CWTS more often, which Ludo gladly accepted. Like many around the world,
      we did not expect a pandemic. My next trip was scheduled for March 17\u201320:
      the first week everyone at Leiden University started to work remotely.</p><h3>How
      remote learning has changed since coronavirus struck</h3><p>Breaking news a
      week before my next trip to Leiden: the situation was changing rapidly. On Thursday,
      March 12, the subject of an email received from the university said: \u201CCORONA:
      teaching AND exams cancelled on Friday\u201D. Several days later, the Lithuanian
      Government banned any travel abroad, and flights were cancelled. </p><p>I felt
      gutted to miss the arranged meetings. No one knows when it will finish. But
      Leiden University and CWTS were amazingly prompt to arrange entirely remote
      workspaces for all staff and students. </p><p>It was such a surprise: \u201CYou
      have been added to a staff team in Microsoft Teams\u201D. This came right when
      my flight to Amsterdam had been expected to land. It made my day! I immediately
      installed Microsoft Teams and checked over its features. Over the next few days,
      all of CWTS, including the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/research-groups/quantitative-science-studies\"
      target=\"_blank\">Quantitative Science Studies</a> group, moved online with
      weekly, monthly, or occasional meetings. I have been invited to participate
      in any activities I could contribute to! </p><p>The lockdown has brought me
      closer to colleagues in the Netherlands than I expected. Who would have thought?
      Online features have also helped to bridge some gaps. </p><p>For instance, at
      next online Friday meeting, after a presentation delivered by <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/ismael-rafols\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dr Ismael Rafols</a>, I was curious about his and Professor
      <a href=\"https://www.leydesdorff.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Loet Leydesdorff\u2019s</a>
      discussion on the term \u2018uncertainties\u2019. Unfortunately, I had missed
      the title of a book suggested by the professor. Luckily, <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/vincent-traag\"
      target=\"_blank\">Vincent Traag</a> posted it in the chat: The Honest Broker.
      This means nobody missed it. I was even able to download it immediately after
      the meeting from the library. </p><p>Another example comes from the CWTS virtual
      bar, such a great place to chat and exchange experiences. The following week
      with my non-virtual cup of coffee, I met Ismael Rafols and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/thed-van-leeuwen\"
      target=\"_blank\">Thed van Leeuwen</a>. After a short talk, they shared even
      more useful publications with me! To be honest, when I was in Leiden, I did
      not dare to disturb senior researchers.</p><p>The most exciting illustration
      arose from the weekly <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/research-groups/quantitative-science-studies\"
      target=\"_blank\">Quantitative Science Studies</a> meetings moderated by Vincent
      Traag, where we share what we have recently discovered and discuss different
      topics and papers. This gave me the chance to present my research to colleagues,
      receive their feedback, and prepare an article for submission. I so much enjoy
      being part of this research group.</p><p>It is incredible how the lockdown changed
      my life! I am getting closer to colleagues and busier with my research. I do
      believe the pandemic has changed some of our habits forever. Hopefully, we can
      participate in all meetings virtually, as an option, even after CWTS staff return
      to their physical workplaces.</p><p>Even so, I do long to visit Leiden again
      soon, meeting people in person I have virtually shared with, and enjoying a
      coffee together.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Eleonora

      emergency calls for research funding are made to tackle the COVID-19, some difficult
      questions come to mind: What types of knowledge are relevant? What types of
      research should be prioritised?</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p><em>In this blog we review
      a sample of funding calls and find out some contrasting research agendas supported
      in different agencies; however, biomedical research seems dominant in many calls.
      We suggest that more public debate on research priorities is needed given high
      uncertainty and the broad social consequences of the pandemic.</em></p><h3>Mapping
      how funding agencies understand COVID-19 related research </h3><p>Governments
      and funding agencies across the globe are currently funding large amounts (<a
      href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDFundingvisualisation/COVID-19funding?:embed=y&:toolbar=no&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no\"
      target=\"_blank\">possibly billions of Euros</a>) in research calls aimed at
      addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Their goal is to quickly produce knowledge
      that helps provide solutions and supports decision making. </p><p>However, since
      the pandemic is affecting so many facets of society, what exactly is understood
      as research to address the COVID-19 crisis? There are areas of research that
      are obviously relevant, such as virology, immunology, clinical research and
      epidemiology. </p><p>Yet, there are also other forms of knowledge which are
      relevant regarding the effects of the virus in its environment and the social
      world. This is the case for knowledge on hospital management, on risk communication,
      on the use of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/4681029a\" target=\"_blank\">scientific
      evidence in policy</a>, and at a broader level, on the wider effects of the
      pandemic on the economy, pollution, etcetera. </p><p>Therefore, the collective
      response to COVID-19 and its consequences should not be based only on medical
      considerations, but also on broader social, economic and environmental  understandings.
      <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/jochemzuijderwijk\" target=\"_blank\">Jochem
      Zuijderwijk</a> made the argument in a previous <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/broadening-the-perspective-on-covid-19\"
      target=\"_blank\">Madtrics blog</a> that \u2018we should be careful not to overlook
      inputs from different scientific fields that could provide important insights
      in the current crisis.\u2019 While there are no effective therapies, some of
      the most <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01248-1\" target=\"_blank\">effective
      \u2018treatments\u2019 so far have been behavioural </a>(\u2018social distancing\u2019)
      and resource management  (distribution of ventilators). Hence, it would be strange
      not to rely on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/29/to-solve-the-problems-of-this-pandemic-we-need-more-than-just-the-science\"
      target=\"_blank\">social and behavioural sciences</a>.</p><p>Under limited resources
      and time pressure, which types of research should be funded?  Past experiences
      suggest that without explicit effort and strategies to consider various forms
      of knowledge, attention ends up <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378009001034\"
      target=\"_blank\">concentrated in narrow forms of expertise to the exclusion
      of the others</a>. Indeed, this analysis provides some preliminary evidence
      that COVID19 funding is concentrated in biomedical approaches. It is therefore
      important to pay attention to <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2007.0213\"
      target=\"_blank\">diversity in the types of knowledge</a>\r\nmobilised for facing
      the crisis. </p><h3>Different framings in funding calls for COVID-19</h3><p>In
      order to find out what forms of research are being considered for funding, we
      have gathered and analysed emergency COVID-19 calls of various funding agencies
      across some countries.  This is an exploratory analysis based on a sample of
      calls, using mainly the texts in the funding calls rather than the funded projects.
      Although we are not domain experts, the primary concerns of funders seem relatively
      clear, and this partial sample already shows revealing differences across calls.</p><p>The
      summary of the calls examined is available in this table:<br></p><figure style=\"border:none;\"><iframe
      src=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19FundingCalls/COVID-19FundingCalls?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true\"
      width=\"720\" height=\"860\"></iframe></figure><p><span style=\"width:100%;
      text-align:center; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"caption\" href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/andr.brasil#!/vizhome/COVID-19FundingCalls/COVID-19FundingCalls\"
      target=\"_blank\">Open Tableau table in a new tab</a></span></p><p>For the sake
      of simplicity, we have divided the funding calls into three classes, depending
      on which aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic they focus on:</p><ul><li>Focus on
      health responses, such as vaccines, diagnostics and epidemiological models.</li><li>Broader
      public health considerations, such risk communication and misinformation, social
      dynamics and prevention of stigma.</li><li>Studies on the social consequences
      of the crisis.</li></ul><h3>Dominant framings focused on health responses</h3><p>The
      first and most prevalent framing of calls for funding conceptualizes COVID-19
      as a technical problem in need of biomedical solutions or healthcare policies.
      This can be seen for example in the calls by the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/research_by_area/documents/ec_rtd_cv-projects-1.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">European Commission</a>, in <a href=\"https://salutweb.gencat.cat/ca/inici/nota-premsa/index.html?id=384510#googtrans(ca%7Cen)\"
      target=\"_blank\">Catalonia</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/chamadas-publicas?p_p_id=resultadosportlet_WAR_resultadoscnpqportlet_INSTANCE_0ZaM&idDivulgacao=9382&filtro=abertas&detalha=chamadaDetalhada&id=47-1520-6822\"
      target=\"_blank\">Brazil</a>. </p><p>These calls support, on the one hand research
      in therapies, vaccines and diagnostics, i.e. solutions based on biomedical expertise;
      and on the other hand, they also fund epidemiological work, modelling and clinical
      studies. <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset\"
      target=\"_blank\">Scientometric mapping</a> suggests a strong contrast between
      these two perspectives (biological vs. clinical/epidemiological), but many funding
      agencies include both in the same call. Other funding agencies, such as the
      US National Institutes of Health, make more specific calls for <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-eb-20-008.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">technological development</a> or <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-eb-20-008.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">public health interventions</a>. </p><p>A key question in
      research priority setting in pandemics is the relative investment in technical
      biomedical solutions versus research on healthcare policy and systems. The balance
      between these options in COVID-19 cannot yet be assessed since few calls have
      released details of projects funded. From the information available, it seems
      likely that biomedical (vaccine and drug) development will capture the lion\u2019s
      share of public funding. For example, a coalition of large charities has set
      up a <a href=\"https://www.therapeuticsaccelerator.org/\" target=\"_blank\">COVID
      Therapeutics Accelerator</a> with a US$125 million of seed funding to support
      drug development. </p><p>Experts point out that delivery of new therapies or
      vaccines may take at least <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1679\"
      target=\"_blank\">12 or 18</a><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1679\"
      target=\"_blank\"> months</a> and that pharmaceuticals\u2019 investments in
      this area are far larger than public investments (e.g. amounting to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\"
      target=\"_blank\">75% of vaccines</a>). Therefore, there is room for debate
      on whether public funding should support more research, in relative terms, on
      healthcare policy and systems -- which have proved crucial in the emergency
      response, in lockdown policies.</p><p></p><h3>Opening to broader public health
      considerations</h3><p>A broader interpretation of the relevant knowledge to
      address COVID-19 sees the pandemic as more than just a biological, technical
      or managerial issue, acknowledging that socio-political contexts are as much
      a component of the pandemic as the disease itself. </p><p>A first broadening
      step, while keeping within a health-centred framing, is to study how social
      environments have an effect on health outcomes during a disease. Consider, for
      example, the response of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/institutes-health-research/news/2020/03/government-of-canada-funds-49-additional-covid-19-research-projects-details-of-the-funded-projects.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</a>\r\nThis funding
      call also includes research in the categories of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostic
      and healthcare management. However, it also funds many projects that focus on
      issues such as social dynamics, risk communication, and trust. For example,
      some projects look at how forms of discrimination against Chinese-Canadians
      may be exacerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic; others at sociological considerations
      of trust in public spaces or at the propagation of false or faulty information
      within media in response to COVID-19. This is a noticeably broader interpretation
      of what forms of research are deemed important within the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Framings
      beyond health: on the social effects and responses to COVID-19</h3><p>Finally,
      there are also funding calls for research focused on the social and economic
      dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis, the effects of policy responses, and the
      overall consequences for other aspects of societal \u2013 including educational,
      economic and psychological \u2013 well being.</p><p>Some research councils,
      such as the <a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/sgw/corona-fast-track-data/research-projects.html\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dutch Research Council (NWO)</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/announcements/041720.jsp\"
      target=\"_blank\">US National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) have general \u2018response
      mode\u2019 calls which have included a few projects studying the effects of
      the pandemic beyond health. The NWO has funded research both on wider health
      issues (as discussed above), as well as on the effects on family life, on the
      emotional wellbeing of adolescents and on social inequalities. The NSF is supporting
      a project which is addressing the pandemic through <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2023088&HistoricalAwards=false\"
      target=\"_blank\">science education in primary school</a>.</p><p>The Mexican
      funding agency (CONACYT) has made, besides the usual <a href=\"https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/index.php/el-conacyt/convocatorias-y-resultados-conacyt/convocatorias-programa-de-apoyos-para-las-actividades-cientificas-tecnologicas-y-de-innovacion/conv-2020-1-apoyo-inv-ante-covid-19/\"
      target=\"_blank\">call with a health framing</a>, a call dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/index.php/el-conacyt/convocatorias-y-resultados-conacyt/convocatorias-programa-de-apoyos-para-las-actividades-cientificas-tecnologicas-y-de-innovacion/conv-acceso-universal-c-ante-covid-19\"
      target=\"_blank\">universal access</a><u> to knowledge</u>. This call aims to
      fund the development of public science communication to be used during the COVID-19
      pandemic, in order to improve social appropriation of knowledge. The call funds
      contents for various forms of science education ranging from infographics to
      performing arts and music, especially on problems such as domestic violence,
      addictions, sexual health and lifestyle habits that may be under stress during
      the pandemic.</p><h3>More debate is needed on funding priorities </h3><p>In
      the last 20 years, pandemic outbreaks have been followed by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3552831\"
      target=\"_blank\">sudden surges in targeted funding</a>. During these funding
      surges, there has been rather <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733318301707?casa_token=L2LYMWoaSV8AAAAA:Ns22PmRGl3Ut01btSj1aeW854qT-nj8kKyCKSg5R_42RX8fcJyaQIdixjEgm1yx23AvLkxNADk8\"
      target=\"_blank\">limited systematic thinking about the research priorities</a>
      in the face of urgency. Given the breadth of the COVID-19 crisis, the funding
      research reaction has been extremely fast and large. Since social life has been
      disrupted in many diverse ways and sectors, a variety of research agendas are
      relevant to understand and address consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>This
      preliminary analysis has shown that most research calls on COVID-19 are framed
      in terms of quick health responses aimed at technical biomedical solutions (drugs,
      vaccines and diagnostics) and studies on epidemiology and healthcare policies.
      \ We have also found some funding calls with a substantial budget for projects
      on broader public health issues such as risk communication, misinformation and
      stigmatisation. A few agencies have also provided funding to study and respond
      to the broader consequences of COVID-19, such as through science communication
      programmes. </p><p>In spite of the diversity of research options observed, the
      overall funding landscape seems strongly focussed on biomedical approaches.
      Yet, the relative investment that other options need is seldom discussed in
      public. This is a shame since priority setting in public R&D is likely to benefit
      from more openness. </p><p>This week, the <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\"
      target=\"_blank\">Nuffield Bioethics Council</a> published critical considerations
      regarding the use of expertise for COVID-19 policies. We believe that they apply
      to calls for funding as well. In particular, funding decisions might improve
      by showing the goals and ethical considerations behind the calls, by engaging
      with wider expertise and stakeholders, and by thus broadening the range of perspectives
      gathered.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Andr\xE9

      2015 and 2017, we were interns at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies

      \                                               <p>Through our master\u2019s
      programme <a href=\"http://www.marihe.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">MARIHE</a>&nbsp;(Master
      in Research and Innovation in Higher Education), we were supported by the staff
      members at <a href=\"https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/tampere-university\">Tampere
      University</a> in the selection of internship hosts, but we were also encouraged
      to suggest our own internship hosts around the world. Since several interesting
      research topics for our master\u2019s studies were carried out in Leiden, such
      as innovation studies, evaluation studies, and altmetrics, we came to choose
      and apply at CWTS.</p><p>What did we gain from the internship? It provided the
      opportunity to get to know an international research environment, and its rigorous
      yet informal training finally led us to work in research. Since both internships
      took place a few years ago during our master\u2019s studies, we are able to
      reflect on their effects. At that time, we were able to prepare parts of our
      master\u2019s thesis at CWTS, namely on the <a href=\"https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/101653\"
      target=\"_blank\">use of altmetrics in research funding</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/104125\"
      target=\"_blank\">Chinese PhDs in the Netherlands</a>. </p><p>We were exposed
      to an international research environment with support from senior researchers.
      We were introduced to many experts in the field via our colleagues at CWTS and
      we&nbsp;attended a few workshops, conferences, and other events relevant to
      our research. For example, the launch event of the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/bibliometrics-the-leiden-manifesto-for-research-metrics-1.17351\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics</a> at Leiden University

      all around the world and made long-lasting contacts via the internship.&nbsp;Colleagues
      at CWTS come from a wide diversity of countries, and the visiting researchers
      that came to&nbsp;CWTS throughout the year were - just to name of few -&nbsp;from
      Brazil, China, Chile, France, Iran, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey.&nbsp;We
      were introduced to several research projects, in-house databases and have had
      the opportunity to present and publish research, but were also given full autonomy
      to conduct our own master\u2019s thesis research.</p><p>An internship at CWTS

      crucial to the academic success of Tung Tung as she travelled all across the
      Netherlands (from Maastricht to Groningen) to speak to PhD coordinators and
      Chinese PhD candidates. Grischa received valuable feedback on mixed-methods
      research from Dr. Ingeborg Meijer, and was able to learn SQL with the help of
      <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/rodrigo-costas\" target=\"_blank\">Dr.
      Rodrigo Costas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/zohreh-zahedi\"
      target=\"_blank\">Dr. Zohreh Zahedi</a>. This learning provided several new
      opportunities to collect, structure, and analyse research data. We both received
      support in carrying out literature reviews, building a research design and a
      theoretical framework, and on how to choose research methods. All staff members
      of CWTS were very approachable and supportive. Furthermore, it was possible
      to publish research carried out at CWTS together with supervisors. </p><p>Looking
      back at our internships in Leiden, we believe they have had long-lasting effects
      on our careers. We learned how to conduct research responsibly and gained knowledge
      and skills that we needed to flourish. Furthermore, the possibility to talk
      to colleagues at any time and to get advice on any topic made this experience
      even more enriching.&nbsp;After the internship,&nbsp;Grischa continues to be
      a visiting researcher at CWTS while being a research assistant at <a href=\"https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/institutes/leibniz-institutes-all-lists/tib-leibniz-information-centre-for-science-and-technology.html\"

      unfolds, <a href=\"https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/broadening-the-perspective-on-covid-19\">researchers
      from all disciplines are coming together</a> to contribute their expertise.
      The <a href=\"https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research\">COVID-19
      Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)</a>&nbsp;is a growing, weekly-updated dataset
      of COVID-19 publications, capturing new as well as past research on \u201CCOVID-19
      and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.\u201D
      The reason to release this dataset is \u201Cto mobilize researchers to apply
      recent advances in natural language processing to generate new insights in support
      of the fight against this infectious disease.\u201D The initiative is a partnership
      of several institutions including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown
      University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research,
      the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, and Unpaywall.
      CORD-19 is released together with <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge\"
      target=\"_blank\">a set of challenges hosted by Kaggle</a>, mainly focused on
      automatically extracting structured and actionable information from such a large
      set of publications. The release of CORD-19 is a call for action directed towards
      the natural language processing, machine learning, and related research communities.
      This call has been taken up. For example, the ACL conference has announced an
      emergency <a href=\"https://www.nlpcovid19workshop.org\" target=\"_blank\">NLP
      COVID-19 workshop</a>, and a <a href=\"https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit\" target=\"_blank\">TREC-COVID

      over 47,000 articles, of which about 36,000 are equipped with full text, as
      recorded on April 4, 2020. Before the SARS outbreak in 2003, there were only
      few publications on the subject. The number of publications steadily increased
      in the years afterwards. In 2020 it reaches a peak, with thousands of publications
      in the first few months alone.</p><div style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"><figure

      the term occurs. The proximity of two terms in the map indicates how strongly
      related the two terms are, based on how frequently they co-occur. The closer
      two terms are located to each other, the stronger they are related. The map
      shows a clear divide between biologically focused topics in the left part of
      the map and clinically focused topics and health research in the right part.
      In the visualization of the map, presented below, the colour of a term reflects
      the average publication year of the publications in which the term occurs.</p><p></p><figure><iframe

      also the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3aijpV3\" target=\"_blank\">interactive term

      clusters. The largest cluster (top-left) mainly contains publications on coronaviruses
      and their molecular biology. The second-largest cluster (top-right) focuses
      on molecular biology and immunology. The third-largest cluster (bottom-left)
      represents research on influenza and related viruses. Finally, the fourth-largest
      cluster (bottom-right) contains publications on coronavirus outbreaks, their
      clinical features and epidemiological impact. These areas of research are interrelated,
      yet also contain specialised information, highlighting distinct research topics
      within CORD-19: coronaviruses, molecular biology research on viruses, public
      health and epidemics, other viruses (such as influenza) and other related topics
      (immunology, diagnosing, trials and testing).</p><p>We also analysed CORD-19
      publications using <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Altmetric</a>
      data, with the aim of exploring the reception of these publications on social
      media. Overall 60% of the publications in CORD-19 have received some mention
      in Altmetric, and for publications from 2020, this is the case for more than
      80%. Twitter is the leading Altmetric source for CORD-19 publications, especially
      in 2020. As shown below, CORD-19 publications mentioned on Twitter can be found
      mainly in the right part of the term map, focused mostly on the epidemics and
      clinical characteristics of the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/twitterattention.png\"

      attention of CORD-19 publications (see also the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3aijpV3\"
      target=\"_blank\">interactive term map</a>).</p><p>Our most important finding
      is that CORD-19 contains research not only on COVID-19 and coronaviruses but
      on viruses in general. In fact, only approximately 11,500 of the 47,000 CORD-19
      publications include coronavirus-related terms in their title or abstract. While
      we fully endorse the initiative that led to CORD-19, it is important to be aware
      of the relatively broad content of the dataset. In addition, there also seems
      to be research on coronaviruses that is missing in CORD-19. We were able to
      identify almost 5,000 publications in the <a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Web of Science</a>\r\nthat are not included in CORD-19 even
      though they explicitly mention  coronaviruses or related terms. Many of these
      publications can even be found in PubMed, but are nonetheless not included in
      the CORD-19 dataset.</p><p>In this blog post, we just started to scratch the
      surface of the potential of the CORD-19 dataset. There are many open scientometric
      challenges on this dataset, and on COVID-19 and coronavirus research more broadly.
      For example, there is a need for a more comprehensive and multidisciplinary
      map of COVID-19-related research, going beyond biomedical research. CORD-19
      also provides a virtuous example of open data sharing, and the scientometric
      community can contribute by creating and maintaining additional datasets on
      COVID-19 research. Furthermore, we showed that there is a lot of social media
      attention for COVID-19 research, which calls for more advanced analytics on
      the reception of this research in social media . Understanding the mechanics
      behind the online dissemination of COVID-19 research can inform science communication
      strategies, and provide valuable advice to experts and governments during the
      current and future pandemics.<br></p><h3>Related content</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.046144v1\"

      the number of postdoc researchers grows, studies in the Netherlands reveal that
      they experience high stress levels. This post discusses mental health and the
      main stressors: a lack of academic career prospects, publication and grant pressure,
      work-life imbalance and lack of institutional support.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Academic organisations have
      changed substantially in recent decades in terms of their tasks, structure and
      culture due to increased internationalisation, lower government influence and
      funding, and larger influence from external stakeholders. Like other public
      organisations, universities are increasingly financed in an output-oriented
      manner, and therefore emphasis on performance has grown. The altered financial
      structure of universities has changed employee relationships extensively and
      at different levels. Because of these developments, the number of postdoc researchers
      is growing. Postdocs are highly educated professionals with a doctorate, contributing
      directly to the primary process of the university, particularly research output,
      but with no long-term perspectives and little opportunity to obtain a tenured
      contract.</p><h3>Studies on postdocs in the Netherlands</h3><p>The purpose of
      our research is\r\n to understand how, in the context of labour market instability,
      \r\npostdoctoral researchers experience their working conditions and their \r\nprospects
      and opportunities, in relation to their wellbeing. In a first \r\nstudy (2015),
      we found that nearly all postdocs (85%) wanted to stay in \r\nacademia, but
      less than 3% were offered a tenure track position. The \r\npostdoc population
      is substantial and growing; the average duration of \r\npostdocs\u2019 employment
      is approaching the length of the doctorate \r\ntrajectory. In a follow-up study
      (2019), we conducted a survey among \r\npostdocs from eight Dutch universities.
      A sample of 676 postdocs, 51% \r\nmale, 48% female and 1% gender neutral, responded.
      The average age of \r\nthe respondents was 34 years. Forty-six percent had Dutch
      nationality, \r\nand 54% were from different countries. The postdocs worked
      in different \r\nfields: natural sciences (32%), social sciences and humanities
      (30%), \r\nmedical and health sciences (21%), engineering and technology (17%).
      The\r\n average postdoc duration was 31 months.</p><h3>Job satisfaction</h3><p>Postdocs
      were generally quite satisfied with their \r\nresearch, their colleagues and
      their superiors. However, they were \r\ngenerally unhappy about their academic
      career prospects and the support \r\nthey received from their organisation.
      Respondents think that their \r\nchances of acquiring a stable job in academia
      in the near future is very\r\n small, and they mention the shortage of available
      positions and \r\ndependence on insecure external research funding as the most
      important \r\nworries.</p><h3>Training and career preparations</h3><p>Sixty
      percent of the postdocs \r\nparticipated in several training modules or courses,
      mainly orientated \r\non academia, such as grant writing, learning foreign languages
      and \r\nteaching. However, 40% had not yet participated in any training course
      \r\nat all. Postdocs are aware that networks are critical in preparation for\r\n
      the labour market; half of the respondents are actively networking in \r\nand
      outside the university. However, only one in three postdocs spent \r\ntime during
      their postdoc position further developing additional \r\ntransferable skills
      in order to expand their eligibility for career \r\noptions beyond research.
      Even fewer postdocs (13%) developed some degree\r\n of management experience,
      such as being a member of a research council or board. Interestingly, nearly
      \r\nhalf of the postdocs did not feel encouraged by their supervisor to \r\nfollow
      any additional training.</p><h3>Mental health</h3><p>To measure the postdocs\u2019
      mental health, we used the \r\nGeneral Health Questionnaire-12. This is a validated
      and widely used \r\nscreening instrument to identify psychological distress
      and the risk of a\r\n common psychiatric disorder. Experiencing four or more
      symptoms in the \r\nquestionnaire indicates risk. Thirty-nine percent of the
      postdocs \r\nsurveyed were at risk of developing serious mental health challenges,
      \r\nwhich can lead to anxiety and depression. The most frequently reported \r\nissues
      were: feeling under constant strain (47%), concentration problems\r\n (35%),
      and sleeping problems (33%). Experiencing lack of career \r\nprospects in academia,
      publication and grant pressure, work-life \r\nimbalance and feelings of lack
      of career support from supervisors and/or\r\n their organisation, negatively
      impact the mental health of postdocs.</p><h3>Call for action</h3><p>It is urgent
      that universities take postdocs more \r\nseriously into account within their
      current employment organisation. \r\nBelow are recommendations that should be
      adopted by the sector and \r\nuniversities.</p><ol><li>Postdocs require more
      formalised visibility that can be \r\naccomplished through their recognition
      as a separate staff category in \r\nthe Dutch national classification system
      of functions within \r\nuniversities.</li><li>It is important to raise awareness
      among various stakeholders \r\nconcerning the complexity of the postdocs\u2019
      position, since they must \r\ncombine a variety of tasks and responsibilities
      with insecure career \r\nprospects. Maintaining this precarious balance causes
      considerable \r\nstress.</li><li>Universities should foster more support for
      postdocs by \r\ndeveloping appropriate, focused, and pragmatic human resources
      policies.\r\n Examples of instruments include:<ol><li>Launching a postdoc community
      or \r\nnetwork, as has been done by <a href=\"https://www.ugent.be/en/work/mobility-career/postdoc-community\"
      target=\"_blank\">Ghent University</a>, consequently improving \r\nthe contacts
      among the postdocs more actively.</li><li>Providing career guidance by designing
      training modules for the \r\npersonal and professional development of postdocs,
      including mentorship \r\nprograms. Encourage supervisors to discuss career preparation
      activities\r\n with their postdocs.</li><li>Establishing contacts with organisations
      that employ (former) \r\npostdocs or are interested in doing so in the future.
      This way, postdocs\r\n will be encouraged to reflect on their future prospects
      and career \r\npaths, either in academia or outside the university.</li><li>Diversifying
      and vitalising career paths of postdocs in co-creation with postdocs themselves.</li></ol></li></ol><p>The
      results of the mental health questionnaire call for action: \r\nuniversities
      need to take the initiative to prevent mental health \r\nchallenges, to increase
      wellbeing and to offer adequate support to \r\npostdocs who are already experiencing
      challenges. Of importance is, \r\namong other steps, the training of supervisors
      to recognize mental \r\nhealth issues, to increase awareness of the importance
      of mental health,\r\n to build resilience and to decrease stigma on mental health
      challenges \r\nin academia.</p><h3>Note</h3><p>This blog was first published

      the pandemic has led many to first seek biomedical and epidemiological expertise,
      we should be careful not to overlook inputs from different scientific fields
      that could provide important insights in the current crisis. Here are some early
      academic responses you might have missed.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Many scholars at CWTS are
      now working hard, as they are elsewhere, to make some meaningful and helpful
      contribution in the current crisis. Being neither biomedical specialists, nor
      specifically engaged in topics related to disease or epidemics, a Science and
      Technology Studies research center like CWTS might not be the most logical of
      places to start doing Covid-19 related research projects. Surprisingly, however,
      a host of quite different but promising ideas are actually being developed by
      many CWTS researchers as we speak. These projects are very diverse, envisioned
      for either the short or long term, with some more scientometrics-based while
      others rely on qualitative research methods, and all variably focused on looking
      at the past, present, and/or future of funding, literature and research relevant
      to Covid-19 and its multidimensional contexts. I hope that more of them will
      soon follow my example and share with you all the (very!) interesting stuff
      they have already uncovered.</p><p>In the meantime, however, a plethora of other
      institutes and disciplinary communities - just as far removed as we are from
      the typical biomedical and epidemiological research and literature that many
      now turn to in these trying times - are already way ahead of us, and have already
      started building academic responses, providing meaningful commentaries, and
      compiling relevant syllabi and literature lists. Our own small project, part
      of an ad hoc Covid-19 research group brought to life by <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/contributors/ismael-r\xE0fols\"
      target=\"_blank\">Ismael R\xE1fols</a> entitled \u2018Broadening the Perspective\u2019,
      is meant to gather some of this literature about Covid-19 - or&nbsp;more generally
      the relevant literature on epidemics, the interaction between crises and socio-cultural
      inequalities, social distancing, loneliness and so forth \u2013 that originates
      outside of the expected biomedical and epidemiological fields, and which stems
      from areas that are usually not included in a first selection of relevant expertise
      when responding to this type of crisis.</p><p>This latter selection criterium
      is, as I am well aware, a vague one. However, the point is exactly that: to
      look to places where things might indeed become a little vague and seek out
      the scientific literature that our scientometric sisters and brothers might
      not find as easily when first scouring the landscape for Covid-19 relevant literature
      and knowledge. To see where and how others - in fields in the social sciences
      and humanities (SSH) for example - might provide potentially crucial and valuable
      responses that could otherwise be overlooked by those not connected to these
      fields.</p><p>This idea of ours appeared to be not only a reasonable one, it
      was in fact (of course!) already being done. Indeed, it didn\u2019t take long
      for us to find (in our immediate circles no less) ever-expanding syllabi and
      literature lists being created at high speeds in a lot of different areas. Rather
      than providing a broader perspective on issues and knowledges related to Covid-19
      ourselves, we are still very much trying to play catch-up and getting some perspective
      on this seemingly vast and expanding network of files, fora and lists that are
      already doing much of that work for us.</p><p>This blog post is in many ways
      simply meant to be another link in that network as it is coming into being:
      providing readers with some links to the work of others, who can in turn provide
      you with more interesting links to more interesting work of others. However,
      it is also to force ourselves (as was rightly suggested by a <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/contributors/msc\"
      target=\"_blank\">blog editor</a>) to maybe step outside of our collective comfort
      zones and automated academic responses, which often drive us to try and work
      towards some sort of finished project or end product before sharing our thoughts,
      and instead communicate in the here and now about what we\u2019re seeing. Thus,
      what I present below is both a list under development of an already amazing
      amount of links to Covid-19 responses, compiled literature lists and more, all
      stemming from various corners of academia, and my own initial and brief notes
      on their content, written while I have been searching for and looking through
      all of this as we try to \u2018broaden the perspective\u2019 on Covid-19, its
      related crisis (crises) and possible responses.</p><p>The list starts with several
      links to syllabi and literature lists made and continuously updated by collectives
      of academics working in different areas of the social sciences or humanities,
      which each provide enormously rich lists of sources relevant to the social and
      cultural aspects of disease and epidemics in often unexpected ways. Some prominent
      themes here include plagues and epidemics of the past; the role of expertise
      in governance and society; misinformation and media; psychological strain and
      mental health; social distancing and solidarity; COVID-19 as \u2018syndemic\u2019;
      relations with economics, biopolitics, capitalism and neoliberalism; the Risk
      Society; \u2018outbreak narratives\u2019; comorbidity and social inequalities,
      ableism and gender relations as co-determinant in disease spread and burden,
      and much, much more.</p><p><span class=\"caption\">List 1.&nbsp;Continuously

      next to these collections of old and recent relevant literature, there is also
      a host of more direct academic responses to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although
      our dominant infrastructures of communication through peer-reviewed journals
      prove very ill equipped to move at the speed of a virus, academics from all
      across the spectrum have sought to respond and share knowledge through opinion
      pieces, blogs, curated forum discussions and so on. My list therefore also includes
      both a set of curated collections of academic forum posts, blogs and essays
      (see list 2), mostly centered around a specific discipline or theme, as well
      as a more extensive list of individual contributions I have gathered and selected
      myself (see list 3). This latter list also includes things like short essays,
      individual blogposts and contributions to some more popular science journals,
      but excludes (with maybe one or two exceptions) everything published in more
      regular news media outlets (which means I may have missed some very valuable
      contributions made by scholars in newspapers and the like). Moreover, the selection
      is unquestionably subjective, and probably relies more heavily on sociological
      and anthropological contributions than on those from any other fields due to
      my own disciplinary backgrounds. Nevertheless, I am still very happy that it
      actually includes some singular contributions from fields as diverse as economics,
      psychology, classical studies, literary studies, history, art, art history,
      philosophy, theology, journalism and communication, and environmental studies.
      Though each contribution is thus coupled to some notes that I hope might guide
      you in choosing things of interest to you, I have ordered all of them chronologically
      (unless it entails a direct response or follow-up) rather than according to
      something like discipline or theme. This is primarily due to the practical issues
      of maintaining such strict classifications here, but at the same time I\u2019m
      hoping it might also arouse some curiosity, entice some readers into investigating
      something unexpected, or \u2018broaden someone\u2019s perspective\u2019 as they
      move through the lists.</p><p><span class=\"caption\">List 2.&nbsp;Themed or

      finally coming to my last (highly tentative) list, an important note: All of
      what you see here is built on the hard work of others (as academia generally
      is) and they deserve all the credit. They have on the whole been sharp and quick
      to respond in variable meaningful ways in what will undoubtedly also have been
      hard times for them, as it has been for the rest of us. All I hope to have added
      here for now is to share some of this relevant and compelling literature with
      those that may not have come across it yet. It is in no way meant to be comprehensive
      nor complete; you will undoubtedly disagree with my decisions on the usefulness
      or relevance of what I have in- or excluded; what is included is without any
      doubt extremely biased as it has been collected via mostly personal and disciplinary
      networks (and many disciplines so far still lack any representation); and much
      of it may very well become outdated in a week\u2019s time (though I doubt it!).
      However, rather than presenting the final conclusions on what SSH can say about
      Covid-19, this blog post is meant as a tiny contribution in linking thoughts
      and ideas to people, and as such I hope very much you will be joining me in
      doing the linking. So please: look through it, add and recommend more, criticize
      me for all the important things I\u2019ve obviously overlooked, but by all means
      also share it with those that may find it useful!&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"caption\">List

      does not guarantee a closer engagement between science and society at large,
      which it is the aim of Open Science (OS). In this post I reflect on a previous
      case study (<a href=\"http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/1/Chavarro%20Boh\xF3rquez%2C%20Diego%20Andr\xE9s.pdf\">Chavarro

      reinterpreted here to show how OA could be enhanced to increase its social impact.
      I also reflect on some challenges that the social impact of OA pose to science
      policy<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The need for alternative
      publication formats</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read\">The
      Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> understands OA as \u201Cworld-wide electronic
      distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and
      unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and
      other curious minds\u201D. Many initiatives \u2013 such as OA databases and
      institutional repositories \u2013 provide access to this peer-reviewed literature,
      mainly to research articles.</p><p>However, it is well-known that research articles
      are written in technical language that is not \u201Caccessible\u201D to everyone.
      In many cases, these articles are too technical for the people who could benefit
      the most from the research, such as farmers and other stakeholders. If we take
      into account that a lot of the academic literature is published in English,
      even if those stakeholders had free access to the papers they would face a big
      linguistic barrier to use that knowledge.</p><p>Such is the case of bud rot
      disease research. This disease affects the African oil palm, which is grown
      in countries in the equatorial belt such as Colombia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,
      and Nigeria. It is a large-scale crop that provides employment comparable to
      crops such as soybeans. Due to its economic importance, diseases that affect
      the plant have large consequences for employment. For this reason researchers
      on bud rot need to make sure that their findings reach people outside academia.</p><p>Bud
      rot kills the plant completely and leaves it unproductive. One of the main problems
      is that there is uncertainty about the cause of the disease. In Colombia, researchers
      at Cenipalma \u2013 a research institute for the study of Palm \u2013 found
      evidence that bud rot is caused by a type of mould called <em>phytophtora palmivora</em>.</p><p>An
      analysis of this research on the causes of the disease by Cenipalma\u2019s researchers
      showed that it was first published as briefs for farmers instead of academic
      publications. The following figure shows this team published results about bud
      rot early as a brief and it was only later that they published in OA and later
      to paywall journals.</p><p></p><p></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/figure_1_diego_chavarro.png\"
      alt=\"Figure 1 diego chavarro\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Chronological publication
      of findings on the causes of bud rot disease by Cenipalma\u2019s researchers.
      The arrows show flux of citations. Head of arrow indicates citing source.</figcaption></figure><p>When
      asked about the reasons why the results were published initially as briefs,
      a researcher said that their priority is <em>\u201Ccontributing to the improvement
      of farmers' quality of life\u201D</em>. Another researcher said:</p><p> An interviewee
      deepened in the explanation for their choice of publication media:</p><p>Therefore,
      in this case the researchers published briefs because of their proximity to
      the readership they wanted to reach and also because they do not have the pressure
      to publish in high-impact journals. They chose an accessible \u2013 in the sense
      of non-formal scientific communication \u2013 format to ensure use of their
      knowledge beyond academia.  </p><p><strong>Some policy challenges</strong></p><p>The
      case of bud rot disease shows some demands of researchers from Open Access (OA)
      in an age of Open Science (OS). <strong>Basically, researchers need venues to
      publish research that can be accessed, understood, and used by stakeholders
      beyond academia. </strong>The case indicates that OA \u2013 understood as access
      to peer-reviewed literature \u2013 is necessary but not sufficient to improve
      the use of scientific knowledge in society, which is an aim of OS. OS, then,
      poses important communication challenges.</p><p>These challenges extend to public
      policy for OA. Although many public institutions promote free availability of
      research papers,  this promotion is based on a generic understanding of the
      readers. Basically, OA policies assume that the readers of scientific research
      are scientists with the same capabilities and interests as those who publish
      the papers. This assumption is incorrect, because from an OS perspective the
      readership of scientific research includes not only scientists, but also people
      in governments, companies, and other social groups \u2013 as shown by the case
      in this post. It also overlooks the imbalances that exist within the global
      scientific community, in which some countries concentrate high capabilities
      and resources while others lie at the periphery in many fields.</p><p>For instance,
      researchers in Colombian universities will face barriers to reproduce OA results
      and methodologies published by researchers in the pharmaceutical industry in
      the USA and Germany because they lack key equipment, reagents, proximity to
      suppliers, etc. Therefore, scientific capabilities are not uniform across regions.</p><p>Readership
      and disparities within the scientific community point out the need to develop
      a more comprehensive approach to OA. If OA policies are to contribute to OS,
      they need to explicitly support the production of information for different
      types of readers (scientists and non-scientists), ensure that research on relevant
      subjects find suitable publication venues, and complement OA policy with support
      for infrastructure, international collaboration, and capabilities development.
      Otherwise the benefits of OA for many countries, especially those with low investment
      on science, technology, and innovation, will be yet another unfulfilled dream.</p><p>From
      the point of view of journal promotion, the cases show the need to identify
      and foster communication channels and local journals that are underestimated
      by current research evaluation systems (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2990653\">Chavarro,
      </a><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2990653\">R\xE0fols</a><a
      href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2990653\">, & Tang
      2018</a>). Given that these systems are mainly based on standardized \u2013
      as opposed to diverse \u2013 ways of valuing contributions to knowledge, OS
      can be hindered, contradicting stated governmental intentions to support it.
      Therefore, if OS is to be fostered, research evaluation systems should be transformed
      to be in agreement with these intended policies.</p><p>A way to support the
      development of journals and alternative communication channels that contribute
      to OS is by better understanding in which ways they can contribute to the economy,
      the environment, and social issues. This requires research on the communicative
      functions of science that go beyond academic prestige and scientific impact,
      especially in the applied and social sciences. For instance, neglected diseases
      is a subject of clear importance for many countries in which fostering new communication
      functions is needed. Therefore, regions such as Latin America could allocate

      can think of other demands related to the above: diversity of languages, gender,

      of scientific communication goes in the direction of OS, and provides a way
      to reinterpret OA from a business model for academic diffusion to an integral
      mode of knowledge production and communication.  </p><p><span class=\"caption\"><sup>1</sup>

      attending a workshop on virtual meetings in academia, our author Carole de Bordes
      would not have expected how relevant this topic would soon be. This blog post
      gives insights into some solutions for more sustainable conferencing and collaboration
      from today\u2019s perspective.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>At CWTS, many researchers
      travel around the world to attend conferences, meet with relevant stakeholders,
      give lectures and/or provide trainings. But what are the costs of all these
      travels? There are many reasons to avoid flying and to facilitate virtual conferencing,
      including climate change, work pressure, and seeking to include a diverse audience.
      Well, in addition to that, we can add the rapid spread of a pandemic for several
      weeks now\u2026</p><p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> of February, I followed \u2013
      physically \u2013 a workshop at the <a href=\"https://plnt.nl/en/event/edtech-for-sustainability-designing-conferencing-to-go-digital-2/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Leiden Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> (organized
      in partnership with Leiden University) on virtual meetings and conferences.
      This fruitful event was organized as a Design Thinking afternoon where participants
      met and interacted to come up with solutions for sustainable (digital) events.
      One must say: what a bizarre coincidence to attend such a workshop just a few
      weeks before the COVID-19 crisis really hit the Netherlands \u2013 implying
      social distancing and remote working. </p><p>In this blog post, I will present
      the most relevant outcomes of the workshop for our institute and will follow
      up with a short discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our daily
      (new) routines at CWTS. </p><p>Before attending this workshop, I set two main
      goals for myself:</p><ul><li>To learn&nbsp;from best practices to help in convincing
      my colleagues to organize conferences and meetings in a sustainable way, including
      flying less;</li><li>To be able to provide&nbsp;input on possible improvements
      of the available technology for virtual conferencing and remote working.</li></ul><ul></ul><p>In
      the workshop, we discussed the use of tech-solutions as well as non-tech solutions
      concerning three different cases.&nbsp;</p><p>1. If you cannot or do not want
      to attend a conference (or meeting) physically, a few options are available:</p><ul><li>
      \        Attending the meeting virtually by using a digital tool such as Skype
      for Business, Microsoft Teams meeting, etc.</li><li>         Organizing and/or
      attending \u201Chub meetings\u201D: instead of travelling to the other side
      of the world, you can set a hub in your region to avoid flying and to enjoy
      the benefits of meeting physically with other people.</li><li>         Using
      and piloting a telepresence robot: the chance to try and \"beam\" yourself into
      a distant robotic body is an exciting idea. However, would you get the same
      experience as being there physically? Considering that most interactions between
      people occur during informal moments such as coffee breaks, the robot would
      hardly be able to replace you!</li></ul><p>2. If you decide to organize a digital
      meeting yourself, one important step to take is to define some rules of engagement
      for the people who participate virtually. It is important to communicate in
      advance how to access the meeting and to make sure that everyone has the digital
      tool available on his computer. Then, you need to decide: <em>Who will chair
      the meeting? Who will take notes?</em> You also need to make sure that virtual
      attendees are able to participate, for example by using a chat option. You need
      to ask people to mute themselves to prevent sound disruptions unless you have
      agreed before starting the meeting that participants can contribute to the discussion
      by asking questions at any time. Such rules seem to be implicit, but they are
      necessary for the smooth running of the meeting. Additionally, some tips were
      suggested by the audience to keep people online and awake for a full day of
      conference:</p><ul><li>With the \u201Ccarrot\u201D incentive, you get something
      if you stay until the end of the day. </li><li>Everyone gets a \u201Cbuddy\u201D
      to check on regularly. This enhances interaction and accountability.</li><li>Being
      creative during lunch or coffee breaks. For example, someone could organize
      a live Spanish cooking class (i.e., from a Spanish participant) to virtually
      share a tapas lunch.</li></ul><p>One-third of the workshop participants attended
      virtually. Like that, we got live experience in what it means to have 16 people
      connected and being able to interact with us. Personally, I found it impressive
      and well organized but also distractive\u2026 My focus was mostly on the chat
      appearing on the right side of the screen instead of the speech given by the
      lecturer. </p><p>3. If you wish to attend a conference (or meeting) in person
      or plan to organize an event yourself, you might want to find sustainable solutions
      to limit your carbon footprint. To think further about this, participants were
      divided into groups (with all the virtual participants forming one single group)
      and asked to discuss and come up with a list of tips. Below are a few examples:</p><ul><li>
      \        Travelling by train instead of plane if possible.</li><li>Selecting
      a venue that already supports sustainable practices.</li><li>Choosing a catering
      supplier that offers a meat-free diet, uses reusable eco coffee cups made from
      a sustainable material like bamboo, offers tap water in jars instead of plastic
      bottles, uses seasonal and/or local products, etc.</li><li>         Asking participants
      in advance if they would like a full portion or half portion for the meals to
      avoid food waste.</li><li>         Handing out reusable goodie bags.</li></ul><p>All
      in all, this workshop was a very enriching experience for me. I learned a lot
      and more importantly, it made me realize that moving towards virtual conferences
      and meetings is not only an option anymore but a necessity. Virtual meetings
      are powerful tools to ensure organizational continuity in emergency situations.
      </p><p>In the time of the COVID-19 crisis, more and more countries around the
      world take extreme measures to prevent the spread of the virus. It results in
      universities, public administration, and private companies being closed. The
      \u201Cordinary\u201D practices of our daily work routines have changed considerably.
      We have to rethink how we structure our work, how we can be creative when sustaining
      productive interactions with colleagues through alternative channels and at
      the same time even keep up-to-date with research related to the current crisis.
      To do so, CWTS has been developing new ways of communication and working strategies
      over the past weeks: </p><ul><li>Use of a new platform \u201CMicrosoft Teams\u201D
      to exchange information.</li><li>Meetings are replaced by virtual meetings including
      a virtual plenary meeting every week with all employees.</li><li>Coffee chat
      every day at 10h and Friday afternoon drinks at 16h via Microsoft Teams.</li><li>Weekly
      email updates regarding the current working situation and the measures by the
      university.</li><li>Formation of project groups investigating research on COVID-19
      to bundle efforts and ideas. </li></ul><p>To make sure that our remote work
      is being done in an efficient way, our managerial and ICT teams have been working
      amazingly hard. If we look back at these past weeks, we can be proud of our
      new way of working, with all the efforts, challenges and opportunities that
      come with it. </p><p>Even though I believe that virtual meetings can never entirely
      replace face-to-face meetings, there is hope that things can change and that
      our daily work practices can contribute to a more sustainable world! And maybe,
      in the end, this current experience will have made us <a href=\"https://leidenanthropologyblog.nl/articles/should-we-return-to-normal\"
      target=\"_blank\">rethink the \u2018normalcy\u2019</a> we are so used to.</p>\n\n

      scholarly knowledge is communicated \u2013 using natural language, data in tables
      and images as digital PDFs \u2013 severely limits the extent to which machines
      can help us in searching, exploring and exploiting scholarly knowledge. In the
      age of modern information infrastructures and digitalization, it is unsatisfactory
      to continue presenting scholarly knowledge solely as text-based documents. To
      address this, the <a href=\"https://www.tib.eu/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

      for the production of machine-actionable representations of as much scholarly
      knowledge published in the scholarly literature as possible.<br /></p><p>Thanks
      to the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
      Data Principles</a>, machine-actionability of research data has been receiving
      considerable attention. Research Infrastructures have attained a high degree
      of professionalism in regards to implementing ICT best practices in data curation
      and publication of analysis-ready data. I am thinking in particular of those
      on the <a href=\"https://www.esfri.eu/esfri-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">ESFRI Roadmap</a> such as the <a href=\"http://icos-ri.eu\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Integrated Carbon Observation System</a> (ICOS)
      and the <a href=\"https://www.actris.eu/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">European Research Infrastructure for the observation of Aerosol,
      Clouds and Trace Gases</a> (ACTRIS) but also comparable continental-scale infrastructure
      outside Europe such as the <a href=\"https://www.neonscience.org/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US National Ecological Observatory Network</a> (NEON)
      and infrastructure in Social Sciences and (Digital) Humanities and other non-STEM
      disciplines.</p><p>Data published by Research Infrastructures typically conform
      to community standards in syntax (format) and increasingly semantics, as community-agreed
      terminology is used to describe the meaning of data. Also, data access is no
      longer only available through a download link but increasingly supported programmatically
      via a Web-based API<sup>1</sup>. The result is dramatically increased machine-actionability
      of data published by Research Infrastructures: given a Persistent Identifier,
      such as a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), machines can directly access data,
      load them into data analysis environments, and even perform some data integration
      tasks, say convert data to a common unit of measurement.</p><p>The same cannot
      be said for the scholarly information and knowledge (possibly derived from primary
      data published by Research Infrastructures) published in the scholarly literature.
      Take for instance a statistical hypothesis test with input \u2018dataset\u2019
      and output \u2018p-value\u2019 reported as result in a scholarly article as
      text and supported by a figure. Such information is hardly FAIR for machines.
      Indeed, machines cannot easily find and access this information, let alone read
      and process it. Since it materializes as a PDF document, scholarly knowledge
      is not machine interoperable and reusable.</p><p>What if scholarly knowledge
      communicated in the scholarly literature would be FAIR, also for machines? What
      if the global scholarly knowledge base would be more than a repository of digital
      documents? How would this change the global access to as well as the reuse of
      scholarly knowledge?</p><p>We invite the scholarly communication, information
      science and related research communities to contribute to the vision and the
      ORKG, specifically, and help to shape the future of scholarly communication.

      are happy to announce that, as of today, the Platform for Responsible Editorial
      Policies (PREP) is available via www.responsiblejournals.org.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p><strong>What
      is PREP?<br /></strong>PREP is an online platform contributing to the responsible
      organisation of editorial procedures by scholarly journals. It facilitates journal
      editors to <a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/becometransparent/shareyourinformation\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">become transparent</a> about their
      editorial procedures, advises journal editors and publishers on potential improvements
      of their peer review procedures, and presents integrated information about the
      variety of review procedures currently in use. PREP also maintains a <a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/database/search\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">database</a> of journals\u2019
      current peer review formats and provides information and tools for journals
      to use journal metrics in a responsible way.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/prep_launch_1.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><em>Screenshot of a part of PREP\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/database/statistics\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>statistics page</em></a><em>
      showing percentages of the level of anonymity of reviewers of journals in PREP.</em></p><p><strong>Why
      do we need PREP?<br /></strong>The editorial assessment of journal submissions
      and the embedding of peer review in this assessment is becoming increasingly
      complex and diverse. Some journals are experimenting with radically new ways
      to judge whether manuscripts are fit for publication, such as mega journals
      abandoning importance or expected impact as a selection criterion. Other journals
      are moving beyond the idea that manuscripts reporting on research projects should
      constitute the nexus for assessment. Traditionally, peer review takes place
      between submission and publication of a manuscript. However, recently, two new
      forms of peer review timing have emerged; post-publication review, and pre-submission,
      in the form of registered reports.</p><p>The arrival of these innovations in
      an already diverse set of practices of peer review and editorial selection means
      we can no longer assume that authors, readers and reviewers simply know how
      editorial assessment operates. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00500-y\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A recent call</a> for more transparency
      of peer review procedures underlines the relevance of PREP, since PREP wants
      to contribute to editorial transparency by making information available on how
      journals organise the assessment of submissions. PREP also wants to help journal
      editors to document and make transparent their own assessment procedures. In
      addition, PREP wants to provide better knowledge of whether and how the various
      forms of editorial assessment contribute to improvements in the research publication
      system. To achieve these goals, PREP provides a database, support to clarify
      journals\u2019 editorial assessment, and an overview of evidence of strengths
      and weaknesses for various forms of peer review and other editorial assessment
      procedures.</p><p><strong>Database<br /></strong>First and foremost, PREP provides
      insight into specific journals\u2019 peer review procedures in the form of a
      <a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/database/search\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">database</a> based on a dozen questions. The answers
      to these questions characterise the editorial procedures of a journal, including
      the type of peer review used. This includes the <em>anonymity</em> level of
      authors and reviewers, whether <em>digital tools</em> such as plagiarism scanners
      are used, or the <em>timing </em>of peer review in the research and publication
      process. PREP displays which journals are using which procedures and presents
      aggregate statistics of their occurrence across journals. The answers of 353
      journals to the dozen questions on their editorial procedures form the start
      of the openly accessible editorial procedures database.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/prep_launch_2.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><em>Screenshot of PREP\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/database/search\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>database</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The
      twelve questions on the journals\u2019 editorial practices concern:</p><ul><li>Timing
      of the review process in the publication process</li><li>Selection criteria</li><li>Type
      of reviewers</li><li>Author anonymity</li><li>Reviewer anonymity</li><li>Accessibility
      of review reports</li><li>Interaction between actors</li><li>The extent to which
      the review tasks are structured </li><li>Statistical review</li><li>The extent
      to which reviews from external sources are used</li><li>Digital tools</li><li>Facilitation
      of reader commentary as a form of post-publication review</li></ul><p><strong>Become
      transparent<br /></strong>PREP invites editors to provide the relevant information
      for their journals and thereby include them in the database. With this information,
      editors can facilitate transparency of review procedures and contribute to open
      science. Based on the answers to the twelve questions, PREP will include tailored
      suggestions for potential improvements to editorial procedures, including issues
      particularly relevant to the journal\u2019s research area (such as the specialised
      review of statistics, if relevant).</p><p>PREP also suggests possible improvements
      on the journal\u2019s transparency of peer review procedures and editorial policies
      such as policies on corrections and retractions, in line with the <a href=\"https://www.ru.nl/science/isis/research/transparency-declaration/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>transparency declaration</em></a>.
      To further help journals to become transparent about their editorial policies,
      PREP generates textual material that can be used on a journal\u2019s webpage
      to foster transparency about its peer review procedures.</p><p><strong>Information
      about peer review<br /></strong>With so many different shapes and flavours in
      editorial procedures, it might by now be difficult for journal editors to get
      a good and comprehensive overview of the possibilities for their editorial process.
      To address this, PREP provides web-friendly information about <a href=\"https://www.responsiblejournals.org/information/peerreviewpolicies\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">different review procedures</a>.
      It explains the difference between various procedures, e.g. single-, and double-blind
      procedures, open review, or registered reports, including the rationale for
      their development and the evidence-base for their effectiveness in the literature.
      This information including infographics is freely accessible and can thus be
      used for information, training, and educational purposes.</p><p>With these features,
      PREP aims to contribute to more responsible journal management and to open science.
      By supporting authors, reviewers and editors in obtaining information about
      the editorial process of academic journals, it addresses well-known issues with
      one of science\u2019s central institutions. By facilitating journal editors
      and publishers to transparently share their review procedures and by providing
      suggestions on alternative review options, it additionally aims to support some
      of the key stakeholders in academic publishing. This should ultimately lead
      to more open and responsible publishing.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/prep_launch_3.png\"

      to the need for a platform where researchers and stakeholders working on PIDs
      can gather and exchange ideas. </p><p>The welcome speech on the first day was
      accompanied by Salvador Sobral\u2019s Eurovision winning song Amar Pelos Dois,
      played live on stage with a guitar. This lovely treat was followed by the organizing
      board lighting an Olympic torch while Eternal Flame by The Bangles played in
      the background. That torch stayed lit in the main conference hall throughout
      the event as a light-hearted symbol of the festival. </p><p>The first keynote
      address, given by Maria Fernanda Rollo, provided us with valuable insight on
      the use of persistent IDs within the education system of Portugal. Parallel
      sessions continued to reflect the lively spirit of the festival. To give a couple
      of examples, it was a pleasure to follow the FAIRytale presentation of Stephanie
      van de Sandt with delightful drawings, interactive multiple-choice questions
      and captivating narratives. Gaelle Bequet\u2019s presentation featured a jazz
      quiz and the audience had to guess the musician and name of the track. The <a
      href=\"https://ror.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research
      Organization Registry (ROR)</a> team wore lion masks as they organized a group
      drawing activity for the audience. </p><p>In the second half of the first day,
      the presentation of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)</a>
      FAIR1 Working Group, part of the European Open Science Cloud Governance, was
      quite insightful as they are developing a policy concerning the use of PIDs
      to support <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FAIR research</a>. In the second keynote of the
      day, Beth Plale, from the National Science Foundation, talked about persistent
      IDs in relation to open science. The day ended with a lively reception, a group
      photo and a quiz. </p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/group-photo_200313_112248.jpg\"
      alt=\"Group photo\"></figure><p>On the second day, morning presentations focused
      more on methodologies and tools specifically designed for data harmonization,
      while the afternoon presentations included more group activities, interactive
      participation and a party attitude. In the morning, I attended the presentation
      of Richard Wynne, who introduced the tool Rescognito which concentrates on researcher
      recognition and the presentation of Tommi Suominen, who showed us PID examples
      and methodologies from the Finnish Research Information Hub. Both were quite
      insightful and informative. </p><p>The last keynote of the festival, given by
      Kathryn Kaiser, lifted the post-lunch mood of the audience. Kaiser threw a glittery
      unicorn beach ball into the audience and we played with it until everyone touched
      it. <br /></p><p>The keynote, with its unique sense of humour we don\u2019t
      usually see at conferences, came to an end with a couple of volunteers dancing
      on stage: a Librarian, Publisher, Repository, Funder and, last but not least,
      Science.</p><p>In the end, it was the Funder that won and the prize was going
      home with the unicorn beach ball! </p><p>After the keynote, we listened to the
      history and the future of the DOI from Jonathan Clark in yet another entertaining
      presentation. Afternoon presentations did not lose any momentum and the audience
      was as energetic as the first morning. Two more interesting presentations followed
      in the parallel sessions I attended. Mohammed Hosseini presented the browser
      plug-in he is developing, MyCites. This plug-in confirms or rejects the accuracy
      of citations, making the process more transparent and easier to handle in the
      case of a large number of citations. Presented by Josh Brown and our CWTS colleague
      Clifford Tatum, the presentation about the SURF Infrastructure ID was very promising
      in linking together three different PIDs. Making use of ORCID, Crossref\u2019s
      Grant ID, and ARDC\u2019s Research Activity ID (RAiD), this PID aims to provide
      a more efficient and accurate evaluation of infrastructures that are used.</p><p>Just
      like the welcome speech, the closing remark was accompanied by music. The organizers
      were still full of energy and happy about organizing such a successful event.
      We participated in giving feedback to the organizing team and voting for the
      location of the next festival. Amsterdam was among the cities that received
      the highest number of votes. Who knows what the future holds for us?</p><p>PIDapalooza
      was a very different conference experience for me and probably for most people
      who participated for the first time. It was a gathering where serious topics
      were discussed but we also had so much fun. With my blog post, I would also
      like to congratulate the organizing team for organizing such an awesome event
      and I look forward to seeing many such successful editions!</p><p>Note: I would
      like to thank Ludo Waltman and Clara Calero Medina for letting me represent
      CWTS in Lisbon.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Zeynep

      this year, representatives of nine university networks met at the Sorbonne to
      issue a declaration for the promotion of Open Data. But what, exactly, is Open
      Data, and how does it relate to the larger Open Science discussion?</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Walking
      through the halls of Sorbonne University last month, I find an announcement
      on a wall that would catch the eye of anyone interested in Open Science (OS):
      it was the <a href=\"http://www.ub.edu/ire/en/sorbonne-declaration-on-research-data-rights/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sorbonne Declaration on Research
      Data Rights</a>. Signed at this very university a few weeks ago, the Declaration
      was published on January 28 at the <a href=\"https://www.leru.org/news/data-summit-in-paris\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LERU website</a>, and it is an
      important document to promote Open Data. But what exactly is Open Data?</p><p>When
      we talk about Open Science, most people think about Open Access (OA). This is
      probably the most discussed dimension of OS within the academic community. Not
      everyone knows that there is much more to OS, especially if you consider the
      five schools of thought proposed by <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-00026-8_2\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fetcher and Friesike (2013).</a>
      From this perspective, OA is part of the Democratic School, one that calls for
      equality in the distribution and access of knowledge. Even though Open Data
      also exists in the same school, it can relate to other distinct and important
      ones:</p><ol><li>Pragmatic school: scientists working together, and sharing
      their research data, can be more efficient in the creation of knowledge;</li><li>Infrastructure
      School: efficient research depends on proper tools and applications that, for
      instance, can make data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable);</li><li>Measurement
      School: access to research data can be a pivotal part of peer-review and other
      types of evaluation to guarantee the quality of science and its reproducibility.</li></ol><p>With
      all of these Open Data perspectives in mind, we can see the Sorbonne Declaration
      as a necessary call to action directed towards the international research community,
      funding bodies, and governments. The authors, from nine University networks<sup>1</sup>
      (representing over 160 institutions worldwide), deliver an unequivocal message:
      everyone should be talking about sharing research data and, more than that,
      it\u2019s time for people to put their money where their mouths are. In other
      words, the signatory universities declare their willingness to share their research
      data, and that they are committed to work for that to happen. But, it also says
      that this cannot happen successfully unless every other player in the game can
      deliver on their parts as well.</p><p>Thinking of all that from the CWTS perspective,
      our centre is currently developing its own Open Science policy, and our team
      has had the chance to discuss concerns and desires quite in line with those
      expressed by the Sorbonne Declaration. From the fruitful debate I have been
      involved over the past months, I can think of some critical challenges to make
      Open Data a reality and, for now, I want to share two of them for reflection
      and discussion:</p><ol><li>It takes time to open a data set and to document
      it properly. Will universities and funders acknowledge the time researchers
      dedicate to that activity in future rewards and incentives schemes?</li><li>A
      researcher that makes \u201Cfresh data\u201D available to the community helps
      accelerate scientific discoveries, as more people can work on the data at the
      same time. Will the sharing of such data be adequately rewarded to compensate
      for possible opportunity losses (since someone else may use your data to investigate
      and publish about something you had planned to do but did not have the time
      for)?</li></ol><p>So, what is your opinion? What do you think it would take
      to make Open Data a reality? Do you believe the Sorbonne Declaration might be
      an important step to further the debate?<br /></p><p><span class=\"caption\"><sup>1</sup>

      University hosted the Gender Inequalities in Science workshop in October 2019
      - organized by CWTS and Elsevier\u2019s International Center for the Study of
      Research - where researchers from around the world discussed the gender gap
      in science and possible ways to counter this problem.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>The Gender Inequalities in
      Science workshop took place at Leiden University on 7th-8th October 2019, organized
      jointly by <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/\">CWTS</a> and Elsevier\u2019s <a
      href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/icsr\">International Center for the Study of
      Research (ICSR)</a>. For two days, researchers from different research institutions,
      universities and science stakeholders discussed issues concerning gender in
      science from diverse perspectives and contexts. The workshop started with a
      reflection from Ludo Waltman about the much-needed diversity in science and
      <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2w2c4&amp;title=indicators-for-social-good\">the
      inclusion of a gender indicator in the Leiden Ranking</a>. He also underlined
      how controversial and challenging gender in science can be as a topic of scholarly
      discussion. The workshop included presentations from various backgrounds, followed
      by discussions starting with discussants who introduced some questions to the
      presenters for a constructive and lively debate.</p><h3><strong>Looking beyond
      publication counts</strong></h3><p>During the workshop, studies that focus on
      important themes such as citation gap, distribution of researchers, leadership,
      career trajectories and collaboration were presented from the perspective of
      bibliometrics and gender.</p><p>The first question that was raised concerned
      the notion of gender bias in citations. Jens Peter Andersen and Jesper Schneider
      showed some studies supporting and rejecting this idea. In their <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/45374\">paper</a>,
      they identified the gender of all authors in biomedical fields and performed
      a robust statistical analysis showing small differences in citations in favor
      of male researchers. However, they claim that this difference is of little or
      no significance due to the extensive overlap in the distribution of citations.
      There are also other factors that play a role, such as the circulation of a
      few highly cited papers, women being deliberately less cited, men self-citing
      more, the tendency of gender-based topic specialization and women engaging more
      in interdisciplinary research that statistically shows fewer citations. On top
      of all these factors, prestige undoubtedly attracts more citations. Men are
      usually more established in their fields and are at more prestigious positions
      compared to women of the same age group. These are some of the implicit and
      under-researched biases that publication counts may not directly show.</p><p>Looking
      at career trajectories and time trends between 1996 and 2018, Hanjo Boekhout
      and Inge van der Weijden identified the gender of their researchers based on
      their first names and countries of origin in order to understand the coverage
      of female authors in science, their dropout rate and career development per
      country and per field. Their study showed that while women\u2019s career development
      is slower and men have a higher probability of staying in academia, there is
      also a gradual trend toward broader gender parity. This trend is also supported
      by the analysis published in <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/resource-library/gender-report-2020\">Elsevier\u2019s
      global gender report</a>, presented by Holly Falk-Krzesinski. In line with the
      tenets of Horizon 2020, Elsevier\u2019s report seeks to answer the demand of
      data to help close gender disparity in science. Even though gender parity is
      on the rise, the report shows that there is still a wide gender gap in science
      in many countries.</p><p>Presentations led to some suggestions for methodological
      changes, such as moving the focus from a paper-based approach to a researcher-based
      approach to have a better understanding of researcher performance. Different
      coverage of fields in databases and large differences between field citation
      behaviors were highlighted. In addition to quantitative methodological challenges,
      there were also concerns about certain dimensions, such as broader societal
      impact of gender equity, which could not be captured through citation studies.
      </p><p>It was also discussed that in applied fields, such as nursing and clinical
      areas, papers written by women have higher download rates. This could be explained
      by teaching activity which does not always translate into publication/citation
      data. Qualitative methods were proposed to understand the reason why women do
      more teaching while men concentrate more on pure research. Some ideas on women
      being less competitive and more connected to societal outcomes were also put
      forward at this point.</p><p>Seeing that clinical and non-academic research
      outputs are not distinguished in databases and are not equally valued in career
      trajectories, redefining the concept of \u201Cbeing an academic\u201D was proposed
      as a theoretical starting point. Discussions continued on the necessity of employing
      robustness analyses to check for validity and being meticulous about the interpretation
      and dissemination of these results.</p><p>A very interesting question was raised
      about rejected papers. Holly Falk-Krzesinski answered that at this moment there
      isn\u2019t much information available about rejected papers as Elsevier doesn\u2019t
      capture the gender of the authors at the point of entering their system -to
      avoid bias- but Elsevier is trying to get gender data at the phase of article
      submission.</p><p>Lidwien Poorthuis from the <a href=\"https://www.lnvh.nl/\">Dutch
      Network of Women Professors</a><sup><a href=\"#_ftn1\"><u><u>[1]</u></u></a></sup>,
      and Margot Schel along with Alexandra Vennekens, from Rathenau Institute, presented
      some findings in the context of Dutch academia. It was concerning to hear that
      the Netherlands has the lowest proportion of female researchers in academia
      within Europe, even when half of the PhD candidates in the Netherlands are women.
      Even though the numbers are gradually improving, women still receive less salary
      despite the results being adjusted by position and age. <a href=\"https://www.rathenau.nl/en/science-figures/personnel/women-science/research-grants-stepping-stone-women-their-scientific\">Regarding
      research grants, </a>female academics also report less access to academic and
      financial resources when compared to their male counterparts. Researchers from
      the Rathenau Institute also expressed their worries about the lack of transparency
      and data to thoroughly monitor the career development of female researchers
      in the Netherlands.</p><p>Yifang Ma discussed <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00091-3\">studies</a>
      showing that women receive fewer and less prestigious prizes; however, they
      are represented well in awards for advocacy and teaching. Numbers also show
      that the application rate of women is lower than that of men. When female academics
      do apply, it is shown that they often receive as many awards as their male counterparts.
      On the other hand, there is no research based on textual analysis that would
      show whether women ask for less funding than men. More qualitative research
      is needed in order to understand why women do not apply for grants as much as
      men do. </p><h3><strong>Demographic examples from Norway, China, and Brazil</strong></h3><p>Some
      of the presentations in the workshop were based on the context of Dutch academia;
      therefore, having information on the contexts of Norway, China, and Brazil offered
      a welcome opportunity for comparison. The presentations showed that the phenomenon
      of leaky pipeline, which refers to the decrease in women\u2019s presence at
      higher levels of academia, is observed in both Norway and China. The Norwegian
      project, led by Dag Aksnes, aimed at getting quantitative data on productivity,
      citation impact, networking, international collaboration, parental or sick leave,
      to understand factors that can explain disparities, making use of bibliometric
      databases, national statistics, and staff registers. The Chinese project, led
      by Lin Zhang, on the other hand, focused on careers and contexts that influence
      researcher development, such as the hierarchical model of the Chinese higher
      education system and cultural pressure concerning maternity. In both countries,
      demographic factors, such as the age of entry into academia, were suggested
      to explain the imbalance as the highest positions at the moment are occupied
      by academics who had received their PhD degrees in the 80s and 90s when there
      were fewer women in academia at large. </p><p>In Andr\xE9 Brasil\u2019s presentation,
      the context of Brazil stands as a good example among the others, as policy has
      a strong influence on gender equity in academia. In Brazil, public research
      is conducted at universities, where people are hired through a national selection
      process. This selection process is considered to be unbiased and everyone at
      the same professional level receives the same salary across the country. Even
      though there are more women in academia compared to many other countries, the
      high concentration of male academics at higher levels is still a trend. This
      difference was also explained by demographic reasons. One interesting note to
      mention is that in Brazil women receive more grants than men (60%) and these
      grants are not only related to research but also teaching.</p><h3><strong>Starting
      a family as a limitation on women</strong></h3><p>An interpretation of the ages
      and dropout periods of female researchers could point to the idea that they
      may be taking breaks in their careers in order to take care of their children.
      This particular cost of parenting as a factor that affects gender disparity
      in science was introduced in Gemma Derrick\u2019s presentation. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/models-of-parenting-and-its-effect-on-academic-productivity(7b016fd3-bbe5-4be7-9323-7412b49c6aad).html\">According
      to the survey 'Models of parenting and its effect on academic productivity'</a>,
      which collected data on parenting practices, the number of publications by researchers
      of both genders decreases in the event of having children. Parental leave, both
      maternal and paternal, is aimed as a facility to ease the burden of parenting;
      however, it is also considered within implicit bias against female researchers.
      The possibility of women taking parental leave decreases their likelihood of
      getting hired for certain positions. In some countries, as in the Netherlands,
      men do not get as much parental leave, which systematically pushes the parental
      leave burden and bias toward female researchers. On the other hand, women are
      also criticized for using parental leave as free time for writing more articles
      or grant proposals. Still, there is no doubt that parenting delays the careers
      of researchers, but especially the careers of women.</p><h3><strong>Difference
      or bias?</strong></h3><p>One of the questions that were raised was whether there
      was a real difference or bias in terms of gender disparity. Alessandro Strumia
      introduced this question in his presentation about gender bias in the field
      of physics. He presented a bibliometric study showing no significant differences
      between genders in giving (self-)citations, hiring rates and timing, career
      breaks, and abandonment rates in this field. He suggested some controversial
      interpretations and possible explanations, which were criticized during the
      following discussion. Strumia emphasized the value of large-scale data analysis,
      and he seemed to dismiss political, sociological or psychological approaches
      to the interpretation of his results. His approach was to explain differences
      using the idea of higher male variability as well as ideas about essentialist
      tendencies on diversification of interests and attitudes. Strumia mentioned
      political ideology behind positive discrimination in academia, but he did not
      seem open to suggestions on the usefulness of feminist theory for understanding
      of gender differences in science, although the audience pointed to its critical
      importance.</p><h3><strong>Why gender? Diversity to improve science</strong></h3><p>One
      of the approaches commonly employed to fight gender disparity is positive discrimination
      in hiring and grant distribution practices. However, this approach can sometimes
      be perceived as a way to diminish the merits of women who receive privileges
      from such discrimination. On the other hand, merely increasing the number of
      female researchers would fall short in the struggle against gender disparity.
      A more comprehensive change would be needed for sustainable gender equity in
      science. If scrutinizing and improving the system is not a priority, adding
      more female researchers into the same mix would not create lasting change. On
      this point, Margot Schel and Ingeborg Meijer advocated for changing the approaches
      typically associated with male-dominant environments. Qualitative studies of
      early career grant receivers (Meijer and van der Weijden, 2016) reveal that
      women are less interested in focusing their careers only on the race for publications
      and grants applications. Instead, they concentrate more on teaching, public
      outreach, policy writing, and academic practices that advance their career in
      a much broader sense. Discussants also underlined the idea that a redefinition
      of excellence would be a step in the right direction. The shortcomings of bibliometrics
      alone in determining the root of gender issues point to the importance of collaboration
      with other fields and disciplines. </p><p>The final presentation by Holly Falk-Krzesinski
      focused on how publishers can influence policy to promote diversity and change
      in science. The relevance of this change can be seen in a Lancet study which
      shows that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32995-7/fulltext\">\u201C[d]iversification
      in the scientific workforce and in the research populations\u2014from cell lines,
      to rodents, to humans\u2014is essential to produce the most rigorous and effective
      medical research\". </a>In line with this study, Elsevier provides data to shed
      light on gender disparity and boost gender diversity in scholarly communications.
      In 2015, Elsevier started to study the diversity of conference panels, concentrating
      on the gender bias in the formation of panel members. Elsevier started to emphasize
      the importance of increasing the presence of women in panels, not only as chairs
      or moderators but also as researchers. In the end, Falk-Krzesinski underlined
      the importance of collecting data with an awareness of the consequences and
      implications of such data. The role publishers and editors have in this process
      is also very central to the system of science and responsible research, as these
      crucial actors can implement policies to include more variety of perspectives
      and research populations in science.</p><h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3><p>At
      the end of each day, small groups were created in the concept of the World Caf\xE9,
      where participants discussed questions proposed by organizers, based on the
      research presented, wrapping up the themes of the day in an interactive way.

      day concentrated on methodology for studying diversity. A major challenge identified
      during this discussion was the difficulty of getting comparable data, which
      may also include largely hidden pieces of information such as rejection and
      dropout data from funders and publishers. Other challenges included determining
      which dimensions to measure, finding suitable indicators and the interpretations
      of the final data. At the heart of all the challenges also lied the cultural,
      traditional, biological and societal background concerns regarding gender disparity.
      Cross-sectional approaches, mixed methods, and text analyses were suggested
      as attempts to overcome these challenges. More research into integrating perspectives
      from the disciplines of ethics and feminist theory was also among the suggestions.</p><figure><img

      alt=\"Second photo Zeynep post\"></figure><p>On the second day, the questions
      focused on how research could contribute to developing evidence-based policies
      to increase gender diversity in science. Increasing the number of female applicants/employees
      by quota to increase diversity, providing equal treatment and opportunities,
      and giving female researchers continuous support to maintain their valuable
      contribution to science were among the propositions of this discussion. On both
      days the discussions peaked around the limitations to measure implicit biases
      against women in science, which are by far the most challenging to get reliable
      data on.</p><p>Gender Inequalities in Science workshop was a fruitful gathering

      September we organised the first research retreat at CWTS. Away from our normal
      workplace and usual thinking patterns we spent two days full of pitches, workshops,
      presentations, and fun of course. One special element of the research retreat
      was the so-called &quot;quackathon&quot;.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>\"Welcome to the quackathon!\".
      That is how we invited researchers from the CWTS to an afternoon workshop during
      our yearly first research retreat. But what on earth was that supposed to mean?
      The reference to a hackathon is fairly obvious. In a hackathon, programmers
      come together to jointly work on a computer problem and try to solve it during
      the meeting. We have programmers at our centre. But we have also researchers
      studying scientific research and its relation to society \u2013 both qualitatively
      and quantitatively. </p><p>In the previous months, while preparing our research
      retreat, we discussed the possibility of doing something around the theme of
      research methods. We did not want yet another abstract discussion about the
      respective merits and pitfalls of qualitative and quantitative research. Neither
      did we want a sterile exercise with clearly defined questions. What we aimed
      for was to let people actively collaborate on a relatively open research problem
      that had to be 'solved' at the end of the meeting. That is how the quackathon
      was born. </p><p>By the way: a quack is also an imposter who does things under
      the pretence of science \u2013 like the alchemist of earlier days. We distance
      ourselves fully from any negative connotations. But why not find out where a
      little methodological alchemy could lead us? </p><p>Organising the quackathon
      required some preparatory work. We needed a theme that was broad enough to speak
      to people with different backgrounds and interests, we had to find qualitative
      and quantitative research material to explore during the event, and we would
      have to provide some guidance on possible research questions. </p><p>Thematically,
      we decided to focus on displacements in science. Goal displacement springs to
      mind here (an organization might start with one goal but find itself pursuing
      another later on). But we could just as well speak of linguistic displacement
      in cases where it was once common to write in one language but where another
      language now dominates. Or of methodological displacements when there are shifts
      in the way certain scientific objects \u2013 say, 'oceans' or 'the economy'
      \u2013 are studied. </p><p>Preparing the material was an iterative process.
      We selected some qualitative material on economics on the one hand and ocean
      science on the other hand. In an interview setting, for instance, a policy-oriented
      economist reflected on the way politicians used economic knowledge and on the
      public engagement of economists. In another example, a marine biologist reflected
      on the place of impact factors and the distribution of prestige in his field.
      To complement the interview excerpts we collected bibliometric data of the two
      fields. We prepared some science maps, providing an overview of various characteristics,
      highlighting for example what topics were researched by a certain institution,
      or what topics were published in high-impact journals (see the visualization
      below for an example). We also just provided the tabular data, allowing for
      more quantitative analyses. And we went back to the qualitative data: should
      we perhaps add more to clarify the perspective of the interviewees? </p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/VosViewer_200203_103735.jpg\"
      alt=\"Vos Viewer\"></figure><p><strong><br /></strong></p><h3><strong>Visualization
      of publications in economics</strong><strong>with different citation scores</strong></h3><p>We
      split up all participants in four teams, each of which had an even mix of quantitative
      and qualitative scholars. We then asked participants: what can you do on the
      spot \u2013 discuss, code, analyse, count, calculate, model \u2013 with the
      provided material? How would you design a new research project in which qualitative
      and quantitative methods feed back into one another? What have you learned along
      the way in terms of your own limits and the insights you gained from others?
      Each team freely pursued their own interests and ideas. Some came up with ideas
      of how to use quantitative results to direct future interviews. Others constructed
      interactive visualizations or even wrote a <a href=\"https://www.andrebrasil.net/blog/quackaton-QKZ3189\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blog post</a> on the spot. There
      were even a few cases of digital ethnography taking off.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Group-3_200203_103829.png\"
      alt=\"Group 3\"></figure><p>The interview excerpt with the marine biologists
      gave enough food for thought: Was taxonomy indeed on the demise? Was mathematised
      science more highly valued? The bibliometric data did not provide any definitive
      insights, and most teams quickly learned that some of the data was heavily biased
      by selective data gathering. Searching further, one team found online discussion
      forums about scientific career prospects in marine biology, where people were
      worried about ending up in a job where the of fish was all there was to it.
      And it was acknowledged that a more scientifically rewarding career required
      \"someone who can write code, who is great with stats, or who is handy at signal
      processing.\" Though the evidence was (naturally) inconclusive it was possible
      to tentatively carve out relations between quantitative and qualitative findings
      (see the poster to the left).<br /></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Poster_200203_103853.png\"
      alt=\"Poster\"></figure><p>The policy-oriented economist suggested in the interview
      that national knowledge about the economy was floundering. The bibliometric
      record showed that authors seemed to discuss their own countries more frequently.
      At the same time, the number of different countries mentioned only increased,
      suggesting a broader orientation, instead of a narrower focus on for example
      the US economy. Zimbabwe and Venezuela were for example frequently mentioned,
      possibly because of their economic predicaments. </p><p>Did the quackathon lead
      to transformative new insights? Did it integrate all of our approaches and are
      we now on a joint path towards studying science? No. However, nor do we consider
      this a failure of the exercise. Bridging the quantitative-qualitative divide
      is not a matter of resolving all our differences and finding that one unique
      pathway to enlightenment. Both approaches should remain viable and valid scientific
      methods of inquiry in their own right. However, we can enrich our understanding
      and sharpen our thinking by regularly exchanging our views, contrasting our
      evidence and confronting our own assumptions. Our first quackathon was successful
      in opening this discussion. And we are confident that quackathon 2.0 will play
      a part in keeping it going. </p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Vincent

      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>I
      love quantitative research, because it gives me the feeling that I understand
      what I am doing and I can explain it clearly to anyone. On the other hand, I
      like qualitative research just as much as cats like water. Just thinking about
      analyzing a round of interviews gives me a headache. My mind imagines a scene
      of researchers arguing over the meaning of the words in the interview. What
      a nightmare! But I believe that these fears are unjustified, and I just need
      to read more qualitative research to get familiar with it. An opportunity for
      such a reading came from my colleague <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/thomasfranssen\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thomas Franssen</a>, who is far
      more acquainted with qualitative research. </p><p>Thomas and I argued about
      whether the university rankings producers are responsible over how the public
      uses these rankings (he said yes and I said no). To support his point, he suggested
      me to read the social science paper <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1086/517897\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rankings and Reactivity: How Public
      Measures Recreate Social Worlds</a>, which just happens to contain 14,000 words,
      no figures or tables, and results based on interviews. When I realized this,
      I closed my eyes, grabbed the arms of my chair tight and let go a long sigh
      of frustration. After silently cursing the authors, and the world in general,
      I recalled that I was about to read a qualitative paper. - \u201CAfter all,
      let\u2019s make this a learning experience!\u201D - I thought. I will now narrate
      my experience of reading this paper, but if you want to know what I took away
      from the paper, read my other post <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/university-rankings-misuse\">here</a>.
      </p><p>First of all, I refused to read all 14,000 words of the paper, so I searched
      on the internet for reading strategies and found a video course series on study
      skills from the YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crash Course</a>. As a footnote,
      I was happily surprised to see that the teacher of the course was Thomas Frank,
      a YouTuber that I had been following since the last year. What a small world!
      Anyhow, I followed the course and learned three tricks to read less and understand
      more: </p><ul><li>Have a purpose: The course suggested to know beforehand what
      you want to know from the paper, so I read the abstract of the paper and got
      interested in a method they mentioned. - \u201CMaybe I could apply this method
      in my own data\u201D - I wondered. I had imagined that the method would measure
      something, but, to my disgrace, the method analyzed the interviews with students.
      - \u201CI will never understand social sciences\u201D - I lamented, dishearten,
      and stand up for a glass of water. </li><li>Read the subtitles: The course suggested
      skimming the subtitles to get an idea of the structure of the paper. To my happy
      surprise, the authors had taken extra care in writing good subtitles, and I
      understood clearly which parts of the paper I could skip. </li><li>Discard paragraphs:
      The course suggested reading the first and last sentence of a paragraph before
      committing to read the full paragraph. Using this technique, I realized that
      about two thirds of the paragraphs that I didn\u2019t skip yet were about context.
      I mean, I know that context is important, but two thirds? Later, a colleague
      told me that this volume of context is common in social sciences when introducing
      a new idea. - \u201DThis is so different from the papers I usually read\u201D
      - I grumbled, and then read the other third of the paragraphs. </li></ul><p>After
      reading the paper I made a scheme of ideas based on the subtitles of the paragraph,
      and finally understood what was the paper all about. -\u201DHey, this wasn\u2019t
      that hard!\u201D - I thought, swell with pride, and wrote to Thomas about my
      impressions on the paper. I guess, the first step is always the hardest. </p>\n\n

      rankings are frequently misused by the public, but is it their fault or the
      fault of the ranking creators? Join me as I discover a paper that could answer
      this question.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>Some
      universities love to boast about their positions in university rankings, almost
      as if they were part of a football championship. However, these rankings were
      never intended to be used this way. This is common knowledge within the science
      and technology studies community, but the causes are open for debate. For example,
      who is to blame for the misuse? Are the producers of the rankings guilty of
      negligence or are the consumers of the rankings guilty of a long shot mentality?
      I was just debating this issue with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/thomasfranssen\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thomas Franssen</a>, who argued
      that the producers have a responsibility in how their rankings are used while
      I argued that they have not. To support his argument, he suggested me to read
      the paper <em><a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1086/517897\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rankings and Reactivity: How Public Measures Recreate
      Social Worlds</a></em>. In my other blog post called <em><a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/quantitative-researcher-reads-qualitative-paper\">Juan
      reads a paper part 2: The experience</a></em>, I described my experience of
      reading this paper but now I will give a short overview of my impressions after
      reading it because I believe that this paper is quite relevant for anyone interested
      in the misuse of university rankings.</p><p>The paper proposes to frame the
      misuse of rankings through the concept of <em>Reactivity, </em>which, in the
      field of sociology, means the phenomenon that happens when the measurement of
      an object of study also changes that object. I believe that <em>Reactivity </em>is
      useful for thinking about the consequences of misusing a ranking. The paper
      identified two mechanisms for <em>Reactivity </em>to manifest:</p><ul><li><em>Self</em><em>\u2010</em><em>fulfilling
      prophecy</em>: A false assessment about the university makes that assessment
      to become true. This mechanism can happen in four ways:<ul><li><em>The Effects
      of Rankings on External Audiences</em>: The students think that the university
      is good, therefore good students go to the university, and therefore the university
      becomes good.</li><li><em>The Influences of Prior Rankings on Survey Responses</em>:
      The evaluators of a university know that the university was evaluated positively
      in the past, so in the absence of relevant knowledge they evaluate it positively
      again.</li><li><em>Distributing Resources by Ranking</em>: Positively evaluated
      universities receive more money, therefore they become better universities.</li><li><em>Realizing
      Embedded Assumptions</em>: The universities want to perform better in rankings,
      therefore they focus on improving the attributes that the ranking measures.</li></ul></li><li><em>Commensuration</em>:
      An assessment about universities changes how the public assesses universities.
      This mechanism can happen in three ways:<ul><li><em>Simplifying Information</em>:
      The ranking measures few attributes of the universities, therefore the public
      thinks that only these attributes matter.</li><li><em>Commensuration Unites
      and Distinguishes Relations</em>: The ranking includes different types of universities,
      even though the public might think that these universities are of the same type.
      For example, if you make a ranking of law schools, the users of the ranking
      would naturally think that the schools are comparable, when in reality they
      have totally different focuses (e.g. penal, business).</li><li><em>Commensuration
      Invites Reflection on What Numbers Represent</em>: The attributes that the ranking
      measures are supposed to represent something that they don't actually represent.
      For example, number of papers published is supposed to represent productivity,
      but it ignores other forms of productivity (more information on this example
      can be found in this other <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2r253.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paper</a> published by our institute).</li></ul></li></ul><p>With
      these new concepts I could think and express myself more clearly on the misuse
      of university rankings. Now I have a new position on my debate with Thomas:
      I believe that the producers of rankings are responsible of <em>Simplifying
      Information</em>, and if they make more rankings that measure different attributes
      of the universities then the people will make their own judgments about which
      university is better according to the attributes they value the most. For example,
      I am currently working with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/rodrigocostas\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rodrigo Costas</a> on a paper
      about analyzing the researchers of universities (i.e. their workforce), as in
      how much the researchers of a university collaborate with each other or how
      much the university production depends on its most productive researchers. We
      expect that these new perspectives will provide more contextualized insights
      on how universities perform.</p><p>My take away message for you is to remember
      the concept of <em>Reactivity:</em> the next time you think about university
      rankings, it will give you a clearer vision and you might be more critical.<br

      as a Java web app but deserves a separate blog post due to its complexity.)</p><h3>Local
      Citation Network</h3><p>Let's say I'm currently writing a paper on genetics
      and have exported my current sources (58 in total) with my reference manager
      of choice (Zotero) as a BibTeX file (RIS, JSON, etc. also work). Then, I've
      opened <a href=\"https://timwoelfle.github.io/Local-Citation-Network/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Local Citation Network</a> and scanned this text
      file for DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers, a unique identifier for papers),
      instructing the web app to retrieve the reference lists of these input articles
      from Microsoft Academic and to construct their citation network. The papers
      are ordered by year from top (newer) to bottom (older) and the edges / arrows
      indicate citations. The locally most-cited papers have the largest node diameter.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/wolfle11.png\" alt=\"\" /></figure><p><br
      />The currently highlighted paper by Westra et al. from 2013 got the most citations
      from the remaining 57 input articles (7 in total, all of them above \u2013 this
      number is called \u201Cin\u2013degree\u201D) and cites two older input papers
      below. However, you'll notice it cites a third, star\u2013shaped article by
      Hindorff et al. from 2009: This is a suggested article, a highly cited paper
      not yet among the set of input articles. </p><p>In the overview tables of input
      and suggested articles you can read the abstracts and sort or filter by title,
      abstract, author, year and journal. The co\u2013authorship network (not shown)
      helps to identify the most influential authors among the current articles. You
      can also open the list of global citations in Microsoft Academic or the complete
      reference list of a paper in a new tab in Local Citation Network itself, creating
      a new citation network for them.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/wolfle21.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>This brings us to the second mode of operation
      for Local Citation Network: Instead of scanning a text file for DOIs, you can
      supply a single DOI (which can easily be found in the small print of most scientific
      publications) and have the web app treat it as a \u201Csource article\u201D,
      constructing the citation network based on all of its references. This way you
      can get a quick overview of the scientific literature used by a single paper.</p><h3>Citation
      Gecko</h3><p>The second web app I'd like to introduce is similar in spirit but
      different in implementation: <a href=\"http://citationgecko.com/\">Citation
      Gecko</a> by Barney Walker. It is older than my Local Citation Network and to
      be honest, if I had known it, I wouldn't have seen any need to create something
      myself. Be that as it may, now there are two open source web apps that complement
      each other very well! I'll briefly walk you through Citation Gecko and then
      I'll highlight the differences and strengths of each of the two.</p><p>Citation
      Gecko has a more incremental approach: You start with a few \u201Cseed papers\u201D
      (5 or 6 are recommended) and then the web app includes all of their references
      and even global citations in the citation network, obtained from Crossref and
      OpenCitations. Including global citations has the advantage that you can also
      identify papers newer than all of your seed papers, making it bidirectional
      in time. Next, you can add any recommended paper to your set of seed papers,
      incrementally increasing the size of your network.</p><p>To stick with my example\u2013paper
      on genetics, I've imported a BibTeX file containing the 6 most important papers
      from my 58 input articles in Citation Gecko. These seed articles are highlighted
      in yellow and the node size of the grey recommended articles depends on how
      many seed articles they cite / are cited by. Again, the article \u201CSystematic
      identification of trans eQTLs as putative drivers of known disease associations\u201D
      by Westra et al. from 2013 is highlighted. It only cites one other seed article
      (the dark yellow node from 2010), the highlighted dark grey articles above it
      are all recommended because they cite it and the two highlighted dark grey articles
      below it are recommended because they are cited by it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/wolfle31.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><br />In fact, all articles referenced by the seed papers
      or referencing them are recommended and you can scroll for a long time in all
      directions in the timeline view. If this is too tedious, you can also switch
      to a pure network view (where the gecko has got its name from). Here you have
      to decide whether you want the edges to represent incoming or outgoing citations.
      Below is my genetics example and as you can see, the number of global incoming
      citations can be quite huge with seminal papers (as visible by the big point\u2013clouds
      around the seed papers). The most interesting recommended papers are now the
      ones in between, citing more than one of the seed papers. These papers can potentially
      be added to the pool of seed papers, incrementally increasing the network size.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/wolfle41.png\" alt=\"\" /></figure><h3><br
      /></h3><h3><br /></h3><h3>Comparison</h3><p>Local Citation Network and Citation
      Gecko each have unique strengths that potentially make them interesting to researchers.
      Given that Citation Gecko starts with a small number of seed articles and quickly
      gives hundreds of recommendations, I would recommend using it at the beginning
      of the literature discovery process. Local Citation Network on the other hand
      prefers much larger input lists and only gives a few recommendations. I would
      thus recommend it more at the end of the literature discovery process or to
      gain a quick overview of the reference list of an already published paper.</p><p><a

      publications to research fields can be a challenge. While the demarcation of
      fields can be supported by algorithms, labeling fields properly requires to
      know what holds them together. I investigated this problem and discovered interesting
      reasons for publications to form a research field.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>I recently visited CWTS to
      discuss and present my PhD project, which is about the algorithmic classification
      of research publications. My previous experiences when working with this topic
      and the discussions during my week at CWTS led me to further consider the question
      about what holds a research field together.</p><p>In my work as a bibliometric
      analyst researchers frequently ask our bibliometric group for analyses within
      some particular field of research. The complexity of identifying the publications
      that belong to a research field is a problem rarely considered by the user.
      Sometimes the publications are relatively easy to identify, for example when
      corresponding well to a Medical subject heading. But even in those cases, the
      user may perceive the field differently than what is expressed by the retrieved
      set of publications. </p><p>If we look into the fantastic tree of terms provided
      by the <a href=\"https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">Medical subject headings (MeSH)</a>, we find terms expressing different
      properties of a publication. Some branches contain terms that correspond to
      what we would perceive as research disciplines, e.g. <em>Philosophy</em> or
      <em>Psycholinguistics</em> while other branches include physical objects, such
      as chemicals or medication. There is also a branch for geographic locations,
      one for <em>Diseases</em> and another for <em>Phenomena and processes</em>.
      MeSH terms are manually assigned to publications and are mainly created to improve
      search systems, rather than categorizing research publications. Publications
      can be categorized by combining MeSH terms, however, this requires preconception
      of the research category since not all combinations are meaningful.<br /></p><figure><img

      alt=\"Map of science peter\"><figcaption>The image shows a map of science based
      on 28 million publications and their citation relations. 234 disciplines are
      shown. The image is for illustrative purposes only. Certain data included herein

      creating classifications based on citation networks, classes are obtained based
      on the formal communication taking place in the form of citations. Thereby,
      such classifications reflect the formal communication practices of the research
      society, rather than the organizational division of research into disciplines.
      In this case, no preconceptions of research categories are needed. It is not
      an easy task to understand what holds together the different classes created
      by such classification, not the least since the publication set can be very
      large (currently we cluster about 28 million publications at Karolinska Institutet
      where I work).</p><p>To this point I can at least conclude two things from my
      experiences: First, the kind of properties that hold together a research field
      differ from field to field, and second, research fields are formed by a combination
      of properties. I will give three examples:</p><ol><li>Some years ago we studied
      the research field of nanocellulose materials at my former workplace at KTH
      Royal Institute of Technology. Nanocellulose can be used to create strong, thin
      materials from natural fibers or bacteria. We could identify three sub-fields
      within the field, all of which focused on different methods to obtain nanocellulose.
      In this case, the research field is defined by <strong><em>different methodologies</em></strong>.</li><li>In
      a study of mine and minerals research, also at KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
      we noticed that fields were centered around the <strong><em>combination of geographic
      locations and topical properties</em></strong>. This is not very surprising
      since the geography is of importance for mineral extraction. Also within the
      medical field, I have found research fields that focus on particular geographic
      areas, for example, the primary care in Mexico.</li><li>Third, a research field
      may also reflect the <strong><em>combination of diseases and treatments</em></strong>.
      A single treatment may be applied to several diseases. For example, hydroxyurea
      is a medication that is used to treat several different conditions, among others,
      sickle cell disease and cervical cancer. Both cases of application can be identified
      as distinct research fields. Interestingly, even a different kind of combination
      is possible: another field identified focuses on the causal relation between
      hydroxyurea and leg ulcers.</li></ol><p>In my current work, I improve methods
      for labelling algorithmically obtained publication classes. This work actualizes
      what defines a research field, and how a field can be described. The examples
      above show that a combination of several terms is sometimes necessary to describe
      a research field accurately. Further, different kinds of properties may hold
      a field together and this must also be expressed by class labels.</p><p>Of course,
      a perfect classification will never be obtained. On the contrary, I believe
      that the availability of different classifications and different methods to
      delineate research is useful when answering different questions about research
      activities. Algorithmic classification gives some information about what kind
      of properties form a research field, at least if we have proper labels that
      make it possible to interpret the contents of classes. I hope to further contribute
      to this problem of labelling classes with my ongoing PhD research.<br /></p>\n\n

      a recent talk at a Crossref meeting, Ludo Waltman spoke about open citations
      and made three recommendations to Crossref.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <p>Last week I had the pleasure
      of participating in <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crossref-live19-have-your-say-tickets-60251255126\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crossref LIVE19</a> and of giving
      a short flash talk on \u2018the value of Crossref\u2019. Crossref LIVE19 took
      place in Amsterdam and was attended by over 100 participants, many of them representing
      scholarly publishers and other Crossref member organizations. I was invited
      to give my perspective as a science studies researcher making use of the metadata
      that Crossref collects for research articles and other scholarly outputs.</p><h3><strong>Open
      citations</strong></h3><p>As I emphasized in <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/LudoWaltman/crossref-live19-researcher-and-metadata-user-view\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my talk</a>, the scholarly community
      should be extremely grateful to Crossref and many publishers for the efforts
      they have made over the past years to increase the open availability of metadata
      of scholarly publications, especially data on the references included in publications.
      Thanks to all publishers that have joined the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Initiative for Open Citations
      (I4OC)</a>, about 60% of all citations in Crossref have become openly available.
      This can be increased in the direction of 100% if Elsevier, ACS, and IEEE, the
      only large publishers that do not yet support I4OC, decide to join as well.
      The photo below shows how I4OC has enabled me to carry a network of hundreds
      of millions of open citations inside my gown. Thanks a lot to Crossref and all
      publishers participating in I4OC for making this possible!</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/gown.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>Although this was not part of the formal
      program, various Crossref LIVE participants informally asked me about the ongoing
      negotiations between the Dutch universities and Elsevier. According to a <a
      href=\"https://www.scienceguide.nl/2019/11/leaked-document-on-elsevier-negotiations-sparks-controversy/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent news article</a>, a combined
      deal is being discussed in the Netherlands for open access publishing in Elsevier
      journals and for pilot projects with Elsevier software tools for managing scholarly
      metadata. Crossref LIVE participants told me, rightfully I believe, that it
      would be ironic if Elsevier\u2019s reluctance to join I4OC is \u2018rewarded\u2019
      with such a deal. A serious commitment by Elsevier to open science would require
      not only support for open access publishing but also support for open citations.</p><p>After
      celebrating the impressive steps that have been taken in increasing the open
      availability of scholarly metadata, I used the rest of my talk to make the following
      three recommendations to Crossref:</p><h3><strong>Recommendation 1: Make sure
      your basic infrastructure works well</strong></h3><p>Crossref\u2019s basic infrastructure
      sometimes suffers from significant technical problems. Earlier this year, it
      was discovered that millions of references <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/underreporting-of-matched-references-in-crossref-metadata/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">had not been properly linked</a>
      to cited publications. (In the meantime, this problem has been fixed.) More
      recently, Crossref\u2019s metadata API faced technical challenges causing the
      <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/4y45gj63jsp4\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">title search feature</a> to be disabled. This for
      instance affects users of the <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VOSviewer software</a>, who are no longer able to
      search for publications in Crossref based on their title. Given the severity
      of these technical problems, my first recommendation to Crossref is to put additional
      effort into improving the stability and reliability of its basic infrastructure.</p><h3><strong>Recommendation
      2: Work together with publishers to increase completeness of metadata</strong></h3><p>My
      second recommendation to Crossref is to actively engage with publishers to increase
      the completeness of scholarly metadata. To illustrate why this is important,
      I focused on abstracts of publications. Statistics kindly provided to me by
      <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-6560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">Bianca Kramer</a> reveal that of all journal articles in Crossref
      in the period 2016\u20132018, just 15% has an abstract (see the figure below).
      Many publishers do not yet deposit abstracts in Crossref. Interestingly, for
      the same set of journal articles, it turns out that 61% has an abstract in the
      <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lens</a>
      (which relies strongly on data from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft Academic</a>). This
      suggests that, if publishers do not deposit metadata in Crossref, the data will
      become available anyway, but without publishers being able to guarantee the
      quality of the data.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/kramer.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><h3><strong>Recommendation 3: Participate in initiatives
      for improving and enriching metadata, and develop fair models for funding and
      sustaining such initiatives</strong></h3><p>In my third recommendation, I encourage
      Crossref to participate in collaborative projects and initiatives focused on
      improving and enriching scholarly metadata, such as <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ORCID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.project-freya.eu/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FREYA</a>, and <a href=\"https://ror.community/\">ROR</a>.
      In my talk, I discussed ROR (Research Organization Registry) in more detail.
      The aim of ROR is to create identifiers for research organizations, similar
      to the way ORCID offers identifiers for researchers. ROR is a challenging but
      extremely important project. It may for instance help to increase the transparency
      of university rankings and to spur innovation in the design of these rankings.
      CWTS is committed to actively contribute to ROR, and hopefully other organizations
      will offer support as well, for instance by contributing to ROR\u2019s <a href=\"https://ror.org/blog/2019-11-13-ror-fundraising-update/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fundraising campaign</a>. At the
      end of Crossref LIVE19, it was great to see that there is a lot of interest
      in ROR. In fact, when the Crossref LIVE participants were asked to vote for
      different priorities for Crossref, ROR ended up as the single most important
      priority.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/ror.jpg\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>While ROR and other similar infrastructure
      projects are of clear importance, they also raise complex questions about the
      best way of organizing governance, funding, and sustainability of such projects.
      Crossref is <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/annual-report-factfile-2018-19.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">largely funded by publishers</a>
      that pay membership and content registration fees. However, publishers are not
      necessarily the main beneficiaries of projects such as ROR. It seems fair to
      expect the main beneficiaries (e.g., research analytics providers, research
      funders, and research institutions) to contribute more to the funding and sustainability
      of these projects. In return, they should then also be involved in the governance
      of these projects. Organizing funding for infrastructure projects such as ROR
      represents a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3454688\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">collective action problem</a> in which a large number
      of stakeholders need to jointly take their responsibility to contribute.</p><h3><strong>Science
      studies research</strong></h3><p>This was the first time I attended Crossref
      LIVE. For me this provided a great opportunity to meet the Crossref community.
      I am thankful to Crossref for the invitation to give a talk and to share my
      perspective as a science studies researcher. Crossref has a lot to offer to
      science studies research. Hopefully the science studies field will increasingly
      engage with Crossref and its members and benefit from their important work.</p>\n\n

      other diseases, such as Ischaemic heart diseases and Hepatitis C.</p><figure><img

      this blog post we have highlighted some features of the new tool. Additional
      analyses, including the evolution of Big pharma\u2019s clinical versus non-clinical
      research, the country of location of both Big pharma companies as well as their
      research partners, or the list of companies with the highest number of publications
      devoted to specific selected diseases can be found in the CWTS\u2019 Big Pharma
      website.</p><h3><strong>Pharma companies included in the website</strong></h3><p>The
      interactive website includes 23 of the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide,
      which are among the main private investors in R&amp;D. In 2017/18, this small
      group of companies invested almost \u20AC100bn in R&amp;D. This amount represents
      roughly 70% of the total R&amp;D investment by the almost 400 companies in the
      <a href=\"https://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/2018-eu-industrial-rd-investment-scoreboard\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2018 EU Industrial R&amp;D Investment
      Scoreboard</a> integrating the pharma/biotech sector.</p><h3><strong>Underlying
      data and sources</strong></h3><p>Publications were obtained from the CWTS in-house
      version of the Web of Science (WoS) for the period 1995-2016. The assignment
      of publications to companies was done considering its complete corporate structure
      (structure as of 2017, recent mergers are not yet incorporated). By doing so,
      we considered not only those publications produced by the parent companies,
      but also those produced by any of their subsidiaries. The corporate structures
      were identified combining information of merger and acquisitions from various
      sources, including Bureau van Dijk\u2019s Orbis and several websites. </p><p>We
      have considered a number of disease groups and specific diseases within these
      groups, in order to get some insights on the therapeutic areas of activity for
      these companies. We selected diseases and disease groups considered by the World
      Health Organisation (WHO) in the global burden of disease estimates 2000-2015
      <a href=\"https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country_2000_2015/en\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(WHO, 2017)</a>. The WHO lists
      diseases accompanied by the corresponding codes of the International Classification
      of Diseases (ICD-10). We then identified the MeSH terms that best correspond
      to each of these ICD-10 codes, so that for each specific disease we were able
      to find the relevant scientific publications through MEDLINE.</p><h3><strong>Limitations
      and next steps</strong></h3><p>While acknowledging that many R&amp;D developments
      in the private sector cannot be captured through scientific publications, we
      believe the analysis of this type of information provides some relevant insights
      on the research undertaken by Big pharma, on their research focus and on their
      research partners. For a more extensive description of the limitations associated
      to the use of scientific publications as a proxy of R&amp;D developments in
      the pharmaceutical industry, see Section 2 in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1306/1306.0947.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">R\xE0fols et al. (2014)</a>.</p><p>This
      sector-specific website is a first step for CWTS in offering information on
      private R&amp;D developments. In the coming months we will offer new insights
      on private R&amp;D, by covering companies from different sectors.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/bigpharma\"

      Which stakeholders are involved and what examples exist on a national and international
      level? In this post, Grischa Fraumann reports on the Impact of Science conference
      from 5 until 7 June 2019 in Berlin.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t
      \                                               <h3><strong>The conference</strong></h3><p>The
      impact of science is discussed in different formats and venues nowadays, and
      an example that stands out is the Impact of Science conference that was organised
      by the Network for Advancing and Evaluating the Societal Impact of Science (<a
      href=\"https://aesisnet.com/\">AESIS Network</a>). The importance of impact
      of science becomes obvious, by taking into account, that this conference has
      been held six times before coming to Berlin. </p><p>The conference offered plenary
      sessions and several parallel sessions with a smaller number of participants,
      such as those on international collaboration (chaired by Beverley Damonse) and
      social media (chaired by Tamika Heiden, Knowledge Translation Australia and
      Ger Hanley, Write Fund, Ireland). Over two hundred fifty conference participants
      from more than thirty countries came from a wide range of institutions: researchers
      in several academic disciplines from research institutes and universities; representatives
      from public foundations, research funders, librarians, publishers, representatives
      from industry and governmental institutions. </p><p>What I liked about the Impact
      of Science conference was the fact that examples from Europe were accompanied
      by many non-European examples, such as initiatives in: Australia, Canada, Egypt,
      Japan, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and the US. For example, the presentations
      covered case studies in the South African (by Beverley Damonse, South Africa's
      National Research Foundation, NRF), American (by Toby Smith, Association of
      American Universities, AAU) and Australian (by Sarah Howard, Australian Research
      Council, ARC) science systems.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/ios_panel_picture.jpg\"

      about some impactful presentations</strong></h3><p>Sarah Foxen (UK Parliament)
      discussed <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/research-impact-at-the-uk-parliament/knowledge-exchange-at-uk-parliament/\">knowledge
      exchange</a> within the Parliament, a project that brings together researchers
      and policy makers. A related initiative was presented by Susanne Baltes (Citizen-Centred-Government,
      Federal Chancellery of Germany), who leads studies on <a href=\"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/wirksam-regieren-with-citizens-for-citizens\">evidence-based
      policy making</a> together with citizens in Germany so that policies are designed
      more aligned with the needs of citizens. Volker Meyer-Guckel (Stifterverband)
      presented an approach on <a href=\"https://www.zbw-mediatalk.eu/2019/02/neue-studie-des-stifterverbandes-was-gewinnen-wir-durch-open-science-und-open-innovation/\">Strategic
      Openness</a>. Research impact tools, such as <a href=\"https://www.researchfish.net/\">Researchfish</a>,
      were discussed in several sessions. Vera Hazelwood (Researchfish) mentioned
      that Researchfish initially started as an initiative by the UK\u2019s Medical
      Research Council, and is now used by several research funders around the world
      to track the impact of funded research. Ongoing projects funded by the EU Framework
      Programme for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020, were also presented, such
      as <a href=\"http://www.data4impact.eu/\">Data4Impact</a> by Vilius Stan\u010Diauskas
      (Public Policy and Management Institute, PPMI). The consortium\u2019s members
      plan to use big data to assess the societal impact of EU and national research
      projects that relate to health, demographic change and wellbeing.</p><p>The
      conference also included the opinions of funders, such as Wolfgang Rohe (Stiftung
      Mercator), who looked at the impact of funded projects through case studies
      on successful interactions with policy makers, among others. This formed part
      of a broader session reflecting on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which
      was chaired by Paul Wouters (Leiden University). Research funders, such as the
      German Research Foundation (DFG), also took part in other sessions. Roland A.
      Fischer (DFG), for example, described DFG\u2019s position on research funding
      as a focus on excellence without impact as an assessment criterion. Discipline-specific
      examples formed part of a presentation by James Wilsdon (University of Sheffield)
      on social sciences and humanities. In the same panel, Richard van de Sanden
      (Eindhoven University of Technology) presented an <a href=\"https://www.knaw.nl/en/news/news/consider-networks-and-users-when-assessing-impact-of-research?set_language=en\">advisory
      report</a>by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) on how
      impact is assessed within the Dutch science system. </p><p>Some challenging
      topics were also discussed, such as blockchain for science, technology and innovation
      funding by Luc Soete (Maastricht University). Additionally, the role of open
      access in generating impact was mentioned several times during the conference
      and was also addressed in a separate session on \u2018Open Science and Governance\u2019,
      which was chaired by Benedikt Fecher (Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet
      and Society, HIIG) and Hans de Jonge (Dutch Research Council, NWO). Some sessions
      were held in a workshop format, and recommendations were formulated for the
      panel at the end. The audience was asked to rank the recommendations in a wrap-up
      session. The best recommendation was from the \u2018Understanding Impact\u2019
      session by Dietmar Harhoff (Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition),
      Wiljan van den Akker (Utrecht University), Isabel Roessler (Centre for Higher
      Education, CHE) and Toby Smith. The recommendation is: \u2018Speak the language
      of the group that you want to reach\u2019.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/small-group.jpg\"

      Torres Photography // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Reflecting
      on the conference</strong></h3><p>What can we learn from such a conference?
      While conducting a research internship at the Centre for Science and Technology
      Studies (CWTS), Leiden University, in 2015, I first heard about AESIS. It is
      interesting to see, how the network has developed over time. To sum up, the
      Impact of Science conference was an educating event where delegates could get
      an overview on current opinions on the concept of impact in the German science
      system and best practices on an international level, as well as network with
      peers. It remains to be seen how the impact of science in Germany and internationally
      is evaluated in future, but the topic is definitely on the agenda. </p><p>The
      final discussion was chaired by Luc Soete and the panellists were Matthias Graf
      von Kielmansegg (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF), Dietmar
      Harhoff, Sarah Howard and Paul Wouters. For the German science system, it was
      suggested during the concluding discussion that Germany finds its own way to
      experiment with an approach that reflects the characteristics of the national
      and regional system(s) of Germany. At the same time, there are also many critical
      opinions on this kind of new assessment criterion, and differences between types
      of higher education institutions and academic disciplines need to be taken into
      account. How researchers engage with the wider society is an area that should
      be investigated; for example, in case studies on open science. This is a solution
      that could gain momentum.</p><p>During the panel discussions, questions were
      also raised about the limits of impact assessments; for example, by David Kaldewey
      (University of Bonn). In that vein, Gabi Lombardo (European Alliance for Social
      Sciences and Humanities, EASSH) mentioned that researchers are also impacted
      the other way around; for example, by policies. This might also be related to
      academic research that generates negative impact, a concept known as <a href=\"https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/65230/STI2018_paper_201.pdf?sequence=1\">Grimpact</a>
      that was introduced at the 23rd International Conference on Science and Technology
      Indicators (STI) 2018 in Leiden. The statement \u2018science is an endless frontier\u2019,
      referenced during the conference by Paul Wouters, goes back to a 1945 <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm\">report</a>
      by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). I believe that this principle of
      science is still valid today, and it will hopefully remain so in the future.
      Reflecting on the conference, I would recommend to everybody with an interest
      in the impact of science to attend next time if possible.</p><p>Acknowledgement:

      things is hard, but labeling groups of things is harder! At CWTS we automatically
      group publications and label them with an algorithm, but these labels can be
      puzzling for human minds. In this post, I find out how the same group of publications
      can have the labels &quot;queer theory&quot; and &quot;home&quot;.</summary><content
      type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t                                                <p>This
      week, as I was browsing the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/information/fields\">CWTS
      fields of science (as used for the Leiden Ranking)</a>, just for fun, I found
      a field with the following labels:</p><ul><li><em>Feminism</em></li><li><em>Politic</em></li><li><em>Queer
      theory</em></li><li><em>Space</em></li><li><em>Home</em></li></ul><p>There is
      something weird with these labels, I thought. <em>Feminism</em><em>,</em><em>Politic</em>
      and <em>Queer theory</em> have nothing to do with <em>Space</em> and <em>Home</em>.
      You see, the CWTS science fields are created by an algorithm that clusters papers
      that cite each other. To label the fields, the algorithm uses the most representative
      terms from the titles and abstracts of these papers. The details for this process
      are explained in <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.22748\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Waltman &amp; Van Eck (2012)</a>. The question is,
      then, why did the algorithm use these labels in particular?</p><p>To discover
      the reason, I knew I had to read the papers of this field. But the field contains
      4154 papers! I didn\u2019t feel like reading them all, so I tried other approaches.</p><p>My
      first approach was to get the most frequent journals of the papers, which were:</p><ul><li><em>GLQ-A
      Journal of lesbian and gay studies</em></li><li><em>Sexualities</em></li><li><em>Journal
      of homosexuality</em></li><li><em>Gender place and culture</em></li><li><em>Journal
      of the history of sexuality</em></li></ul><p>Okay, I thought again: this field
      is about sexuality. But then why does it have the labels <em>Space</em> and
      <em>Home</em>?</p><p>My second approach was to get the titles of the most cited
      papers, and there I saw that the label <em>Space</em> actually refers to <em>Queer
      space</em>. Now the only mystery left was the word <em>Home</em>. </p><p>My
      third approach was to search for the titles and abstract that contained the
      word <em>Home</em>, and there I saw that many of the papers are on queer sexuality
      at home.</p><p>I did it, I solved the mystery! But still I was left with an
      uneasy feeling about the labels. Clearly, the topic of the field was queer sexuality,
      but the labels were so confusing! I dream of a day when the algorithm will be
      smart enough to create unambiguous labels. Until then, I will have to take every
      label with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Juan

      and made openly available for <a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/scientometric-research/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research purposes</a>, is a prominent
      example. Other examples are Crossref and OpenCitations, which provide data that
      is fully open. The launch of Microsoft Academic in 2016 also represents a significant
      development. In this blog post, we discuss the data made available by <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft Academic</a> and we
      show how the most recent version of our <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VOSviewer software</a> can be
      used to create science maps based on this data.</p><h3>\tMicrosoft Academic</h3><p>\tLike
      Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic combines data obtained from scholarly publishers
      with data retrieved by indexing web pages. However, unlike Google Scholar, Microsoft
      Academic makes its data available at a large scale, both through an API and
      through the Microsoft Azure platform. Moreover, the data is released under an
      <a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ODC-BY open data license</a>, which allows the data
      to be used under minimal restrictions. Microsoft Academic data is for instance
      used by the <a href=\"https://www.lens.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">Lens</a>, an increasingly popular website for searching and analyzing
      scholarly literature and patents.</p><p>\tAt the moment, the bibliometric community
      has only a limited knowledge of the coverage of Microsoft Academic and of the
      completeness and accuracy of its data. A <a href=\"https://harzing.com/download/newkids.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study</a> by Anne-Wil Harzing
      published earlier this year reports that in the field of business and economics
      Microsoft Academic has a larger coverage than Web of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions.
      Likewise, a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/750075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">recent study</a> by a research team at Curtin University finds that
      Microsoft Academic outperforms Web of Science and Scopus in terms of coverage.
      However, this study also reports that Microsoft Academic has less complete affiliation
      data. Other issues with the quality of Microsoft Academic data have also been
      reported, for instance related to incorrect publication years or incorrect journal
      names (e.g., see this <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/LudoWaltman/open-citations-next-steps\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent presentation</a> by one
      of us).</p><p>\tAt CWTS, we are currently working on a large-scale comparison
      of the coverage of bibliometric data sources, including also Microsoft Academic.
      Our colleague <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/people/martijn-visser\">Martijn
      Visser</a> has developed an algorithm for matching publications in Microsoft
      Academic with the corresponding publications in Scopus. Provisional results
      for the period 2014\u20132017 show that Microsoft Academic covers a much larger
      number of publications than Scopus (see the figure below). However, Scopus also
      covers a substantial number of publications that seem to be missing in Microsoft
      Academic. We also found that for some content covered by Microsoft Academic
      and not by Scopus the scholarly nature can be questioned. Microsoft Academic
      for instance covers wedding reports like <a href=\"https://www.studioboda.com/blog/en/wedding-valencia-alexandra-pablo/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this one</a>.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/acadscopus1.png\" alt=\"\"
      /></figure><h3>\tMapping science</h3><p>\tBecause we see Microsoft Academic
      as a promising data source for bibliometric analysis, we now offer support for
      Microsoft Academic data in our <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VOSviewer software</a> for creating and visualizing
      bibliometric maps of science. In the most recent version of the software, maps
      of science can be created based on data from Microsoft Academic. After obtaining
      an <a href=\"https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"
      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">API key</a>, users of VOSviewer are able to query
      Microsoft Academic. Data is retrieved through the Microsoft Academic API. An
      important feature of this API is its speed. The API of Microsoft Academic is
      much faster than the APIs of many other data sources.</p><p>\tVOSviewer\u2019s
      support for Microsoft Academic data was used in a recent <a href=\"https://www.vosviewer.com/downloads/Workshop_material_ISSI2019.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VOSviewer tutorial</a> organized
      as part of the workshop <a href=\"http://ludowaltman.nl/open_citations_workshop/open_citations_workshop_flyer.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Open Citations: Opportunities
      and Ongoing Developments</a> at the ISSI2019 conference in Rome. In this tutorial,
      participants for instance used Microsoft Academic data to create the following
      term co-occurrence map based on titles and abstracts of publications in <em>Journal
      of Informetrics</em>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/6bf55519d2a27f7fe1b15f5b2b3e360c_large.png\"
      alt=\"6bf55519d2a27f7fe1b15f5b2b3e360c large\"></figure><p>Participants also
      created a map of the citation network of publications in <em>Journal of Informetrics</em>.</p><figure><img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/9ead031e5874028f09c7f4b6335999f5_large.png\"
      alt=\"9ead031e5874028f09c7f4b6335999f5 large\"></figure><p>\tInterestingly,
      the above two maps cannot be created based on data from Crossref, another open
      data source supported by VOSviewer. Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Journal of
      Informetrics</em>, does not make abstracts available in Crossref, while abstracts
      of publications in Elsevier journals are made available in Microsoft Academic.
      Likewise, Elsevier is unwilling to support the <a href=\"https://i4oc.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Initiative for Open Citations</a>,
      and reference lists of publications in Elsevier journals are therefore not made
      openly available in Crossref. Microsoft Academic does make these reference lists
      available. This illustrates some of the advantages of Microsoft Academic over
      other open data sources.</p><p>\tFor further illustrations of science maps created
      using VOSviewer based on data from Microsoft Academic, we refer to a <a href=\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2019/09/the-rise-of-new-citation-indexes-and_5.html\"

      Tay.</p><h3>\tNext steps</h3><p>\tOver the past few years, we have invested
      considerable effort in extending the range of bibliometric data sources supported
      by VOSviewer. The software now offers support for all major data sources. Next
      steps in the development of VOSviewer include opening the source code of the
      software and releasing a web-based edition of the software.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Nees

      all diseases receive equal research attention across the globe. This phenomenon,

      factors perpetuating these inequalities.</summary><content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[\n\t\t\t\t

      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research efforts in health are
      well known to have unequal distributions</a>: there is much more research on
      diseases more prevalent in rich countries than in diseases more prevalent in
      poorer countries. Why is this imbalance so persistent in spite of <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP67423.html\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">initiatives to support health
      research in the global south</a>? In a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3459230\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new working paper</a>, we provide
      evidence of three drivers of this inequality: the high concentration of research
      in the global north, the similarity of disease focus between public research
      and big pharma, and the higher visibility (in terms of citations) of diseases
      more prevalent in rich countries. Our analysis shows that a systematic underinvestment
      in research concerns not only diseases such as malaria, mainly affecting developing
      countries, but also diseases with a major burden in high and upper middle income
      countries such as depression or stroke.</p><h3>\tComparing disease burden with
      research efforts</h3><p>\tHow is science responding to pressing and diverse
      health needs at the global level? One way to think about this response is to
      compare the burden caused by a disease with the amount of research conducted
      on that disease. First, we estimate <a href=\"https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country_2000_2015/en/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the burden of a disease in a given
      country using so-called DALYs</a> (Disability Adjusted Life Years) for 2010.
      DALYs account for the years of life that a person loses due to death or disability.
      Second, the amount of research on a given topic can be proxied using publication
      data (2010-14), as illustrated for instance by the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/rori/fundinglandscape/?map=biomed\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web-based tool for the visualisation
      of research funding landscapes</a> made available by the newly established <a
      href=\"http://researchonresearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research
      on Research Institute (RoRI)</a>.</p><p>\tCombining these sources, <a href=\"https://observatoriosociallacaixa.org/en/-/responde-la-investigacion-a-las-necesidades-de-salud\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one can contrast the amount of
      research with the disease burden</a>. To make this comparison, we classified
      diseases into five categories depending on whether their burden is smaller or
      larger in High Income Countries (HICs) or in Lower and Middle Income Countries
      (LMICs). As shown in Table 1, these categories go from Type 1a (diseases more
      prevalent in HICs, such as pancreas cancer or multiple sclerosis) to Type 1b
      (equally prevalent), to Type 1c (a bit more prevalent in LMICs) to Type 2 and
      3 (much more burden in LMICs, such as malaria or tuberculosis).</p><p></p><p><strong><br

      increase for diseases with higher burden in the global north</h3><p>\tIn analysing
      the proportion of publications in relation to the disease burden in global terms,
      we find that, in relative terms, there is ten times more research on Type 1a
      diseases than on Type 3 diseases. In fact, relative research efforts decrease
      steadily for diseases with less burden in the global north (see Figure 1). Even
      the diseases with highest burden in middle income countries (Types 1b and 1c)
      receive two to three-fold less attention than Type 1a diseases.</p><p>\tSurprisingly,
      the relative efforts for different types of diseases follow the same pattern
      for public research as for research published and financed by big pharmaceutical
      companies (orange and brown bars in Figure 1). Pharma R&amp;D is assumed to
      respond to market demands, which are generally much higher for diseases affecting
      people in the global north. Since public research is expected to respond to
      health needs rather than market demands, one could not anticipate a priori this
      high degree of concordance. This finding supports the view that <a href=\"https://www.matteringpress.org/books/ghost-managed-medicine\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public and big pharma research
      are strongly coupled</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/figure1_191030_143544.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 1: Research effort relative
      to disease burden (% Publications / % DALYs) per disease type, for all research
      compared to research published or funded by big pharma\t </span></p><p><br /></p><p></p><h3>\tThe
      geographic distribution of research efforts is highly uneven</h3><p>\tImbalances
      in research attention to global health needs can also be partly explained by
      the high concentration of research in high income countries (79%, see Figure
      2) and the fact that research tends to follow national priorities. When we compare
      research efforts by countries to their own disease burden (see Figure 3), we
      see that high and upper middle income countries are carrying out more research
      on diseases prevalent in lower income countries (Type 3) than would be expected
      according to their own current needs (in Types 1a, 1b and 1c). Nevertheless,
      this bit of \u2018solidarity\u2019 is not enough to compensate for the tiny
      amount of health research (4%) carried out in lower and lower middle countries
      in comparison to their disease burden (64%).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/figure2_191030_143748.png\"

      to disease burden (% Publications / % DALYs) per disease type and country income
      level</span></p><h3>The influence of system\u2019s incentives</h3><p>\tIt also
      worth noticing that in upper middle countries there is a relative 50% over-investment
      in Type 1a diseases as well as a relative under-investment in research for the
      diseases that affect them the most, i.e. Type 1b and Type 1c diseases, including
      for example depression and stroke (see Figure 3). This observation suggests
      that in upper middle income countries there might exist incentives, in terms
      of funding or academic rewards, for researchers to publish on Type 1a diseases.</p><p>\tWe
      checked incentives, first, in terms of publication in prestigious journals (in
      top quartile impact), but did not find a bias. However, as shown in Figure 4,
      we observed that in upper and lower middle income countries publications have
      a decreasing citation impact as they move from Type 1a to Type 1c to Type 3.
      This pattern deserves further analysis, as it may relate to publication incentives:
      it might be related to the influence on agenda setting of scientific communities
      based in the global north, or to national evaluation systems reliant on international
      bibliometric criteria.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/figure4_191030_144956.png\"
      alt=\"\" /></figure><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 4: Citation impact by
      disease type by country income level (without international collaboration)</span></p><h3>\tRethinking
      priority setting in health research</h3><p>\tIn summary, the findings of this
      analysis show that there is relative underinvestment not only for disease most
      prevalent in lower income countries (that is for <a href=\"https://gfinder.policycuresresearch.org/\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u2018neglected\u2019 diseases</a>)
      but also in high and upper middle countries for diseases such as stroke and
      depression, which have a similar burden across country income levels.</p><p>\tTo
      correct these pervasive imbalances observed, it is necessary to make investments
      (or lack thereof) in health R&amp;D more visible, as done for example by the
      <a href=\"https://www.who.int/research-observatory/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">Observatory of Global Health R&amp;D</a>. Yet it is also necessary
      to <a href=\"https://cspo.org/legacy/library/100915F1AN_lib_SarewitzPielkeNe.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more resolutely and strategically
      re-orient research</a> towards public health outcomes.</p>\n\n                                                    ]]></content><author><name>Ismael

      "### **A value-led perspective on Open Science**\n\nIn 2021, UNESCO approved
      its [Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949){target=\"_blank\"}\n(OS).
      By signing this recommendation, 193 countries made a commitment to\nsupport
      the development of OS with a vision of [science as a global\npublic\ngood](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/){target=\"_blank\"}.\u00a0\n\nAccording
      to this vision, science is only genuinely \"open\" when it\nembraces some core
      values and principles, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThese include transparency,
      reproducibility and integrity, as generally\nclaimed in OS frameworks, but also
      equity, fairness, diversity and\ninclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute
      to collective benefits,\nwhich are less often invoked in OS policies.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Fig1_2024-01-31-174243_bmfx.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"40420\"

      by the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###
      **Findings of the Outlook: more Open Science, but unevenly distributed**\n\nTwo
      years after the signature of the OS Recommendation, the [UNESCO OS\nOutlook](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\naccording
      to this value-led perspective.\n\n[*(Note that the UNESCO OS Outlook will be
      introduced by Dr. Tiffany\nStraza in a\u00a0CWTS webinar [on 2^nd^ February,
      2024, 15:00-16.15\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\"_blank\"}).*]{.caption}[]{.caption}\n\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards\"open\" (i.e.\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\npublications is quickly increasing;
      the Outlook shows evidence of more\nsharing of datasets, software and educational
      resources; and an increase\nin participatory approaches to science.\n\nThere
      are, however, two downsides to this growth. First, OS has\nprogressed faster
      in rich countries and organisations. This is no\nsurprise: the transition towards
      OS requires significant financial and\nhuman resources; therefore wealthy countries
      and organisations are in an\nadvantageous position to adopt OS.\n\nHowever,
      this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the types\nof OS to develop.
      For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown\nvia the adoption of
      gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\nfor organisations), although
      diamond and green OA provide more\naffordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in\nresources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as
      Eastern\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond OA
      (as\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models of\nOA
      has led to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of\npublications.\n\n<figure

      by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that monitoring efforts\nhave mainly focused on
      scientific outputs (primarily in scientific\npublications, and secondly\u00a0on
      datasets, software and hardware), but much\nless on OS processes, outcomes or
      values. This means that there are too\nfew monitoring efforts on axes of open
      science such as the use of\ncollective infrastructures, participatory activities
      or dialogues with\nother knowledge systems; and little empirical evidence on
      the alignment\nof OS progress with values and principles.\n\nThe dangers of
      this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on\nprocesses and values)
      is the so-called [''streetlight\neffect''](https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm){target=\"_blank\"}:
      that\npolicy attention focuses on those activities that can be monitored,\n[leaving

      conduct open science in ways that are not visible to traditional\nscientific
      indicators. Such bias is particularly problematic because OS\nas dialogue and
      participation is key to help [aligning research with\nsocietal problems and\nchallenges](https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      **Opening up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices**\n\nIn
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress,\nbut that
      this progress is uneven in two senses: it is concentrated in\nthe rich organisations
      and countries, and it appears to be focused\n(according to current monitoring
      tools) more on the internal scientific\noutputs than on knowledge creation and
      exchange with societal\nstakeholders.\n\nThese findings deserve some reflection
      in relation to current OS\npolicies.\n\nIn terms of monitoring, new [frameworks
      are\nneeded](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      are more comprehensive, more pluralistic and which include value\nconsiderations.
      In particular, [we have proposed that approaches to\nassess OS](https://osf.io/4vgq5){target=\"_blank\"}
      should aim to address\nall aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out the
      battery of OS\nactivities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements);\nsecond,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible\nOS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or\ngreen? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third [contextualising the description\nof\nOS](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n(e.g.
      high energy physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural\nIndia require
      different types of OS).\n\nIn terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring
      on inclusiveness and\ncollective benefits is crucial, because science has historically\nexcluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued\nby scholars such

      also equity, fairness, diversity and\\ninclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute

      **A value-led perspective on Open Science**\\n\\nIn 2021, UNESCO approved its
      [Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(OS).
      By signing this recommendation, 193 countries made a commitment to\\nsupport
      the development of OS with a vision of [science as a global\\npublic\\ngood](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\_\\n\\nAccording
      to this vision, science is only genuinely \\\"open\\\" when it\\nembraces some
      core values and principles, as illustrated in Figure 1.\\nThese include transparency,
      reproducibility and integrity, as generally\\nclaimed in OS frameworks, but
      also equity, fairness, diversity and\\ninclusiveness, and a commitment to contribute
      to collective benefits,\\nwhich are less often invoked in OS policies.\\n\\n<figure

      **Findings of the Outlook: more Open Science, but unevenly distributed**\\n\\nTwo
      years after the signature of the OS Recommendation, the [UNESCO OS\\nOutlook](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000387324){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      the first (pilot) global monitoring exercise on the progress of OS\\naccording
      to this value-led perspective.\\n\\n[*(Note that the UNESCO OS Outlook will
      be introduced by Dr. Tiffany\\nStraza in a\_CWTS webinar [on 2^nd^ February,
      2024, 15:00-16.15\\nCET](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/announcements?article=n-t2q234&title=status-and-trends-in-open-science-open-to-what-and-for-whom-the-unesco-os-outlook){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).*]{.caption}[]{.caption}\\n\\nThe
      good news is that there is a strong trend towards\\\"open\\\" (i.e.\\naccessible)
      scientific outputs: the share of Open Access (OA)\\npublications is quickly
      increasing; the Outlook shows evidence of more\\nsharing of datasets, software
      and educational resources; and an increase\\nin participatory approaches to
      science.\\n\\nThere are, however, two downsides to this growth. First, OS has\\nprogressed
      faster in rich countries and organisations. This is no\\nsurprise: the transition
      towards OS requires significant financial and\\nhuman resources; therefore wealthy
      countries and organisations are in an\\nadvantageous position to adopt OS.\\n\\nHowever,
      this inequality also reflects choices made regarding the types\\nof OS to develop.
      For example, as shown in Figure 2, OA has mainly grown\\nvia the adoption of
      gold and hybrid OA models (with substantial costs\\nfor organisations), although
      diamond and green OA provide more\\naffordable and more equitable alternatives.
      Given differences in\\nresources and distinct publishing traditions, OA in Western
      countries\\nhas advanced via gold and hybrid models, whereas regions such as
      Eastern\\nEurope and Latin America have kept a substantial share of diamond
      OA (as\\nshown in Figure 3). In short, the expansion of gold and hybrid models
      of\\nOA has led to territorial inequality in the visibility and prestige of\\npublications.\\n\\n<figure

      Open Science Outlook</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second gap
      found by the UNESCO OS Outlook is that monitoring efforts\\nhave mainly focused
      on scientific outputs (primarily in scientific\\npublications, and secondly\_on
      datasets, software and hardware), but much\\nless on OS processes, outcomes
      or values. This means that there are too\\nfew monitoring efforts on axes of
      open science such as the use of\\ncollective infrastructures, participatory
      activities or dialogues with\\nother knowledge systems; and little empirical
      evidence on the alignment\\nof OS progress with values and principles.\\n\\nThe
      dangers of this uneven monitoring (a focus on outputs but not on\\nprocesses
      and values) is the so-called ['streetlight\\neffect'](https://bid.ub.edu/en/40/molas.htm){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:
      that\\npolicy attention focuses on those activities that can be monitored,\\n[leaving
      behind the\\ndisciplines](https://doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvv038){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npractices,
      [topics and\\nterritories](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/11/28/journal-based-research-assessments-marginalise-regions-like-latin-america-and-the-issues-most-relevant-to-them/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwhich
      conduct open science in ways that are not visible to traditional\\nscientific
      indicators. Such bias is particularly problematic because OS\\nas dialogue and
      participation is key to help [aligning research with\\nsocietal problems and\\nchallenges](https://steps-centre.org/blog/to-meet-the-sustainable-development-goals-we-must-transform-innovation/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      **Opening up the monitoring of Open Science: more activities, more voices**\\n\\nIn
      summary, the UNESCO OS Outlook highlights that OS is making progress,\\nbut
      that this progress is uneven in two senses: it is concentrated in\\nthe rich
      organisations and countries, and it appears to be focused\\n(according to current
      monitoring tools) more on the internal scientific\\noutputs than on knowledge
      creation and exchange with societal\\nstakeholders.\\n\\nThese findings deserve
      some reflection in relation to current OS\\npolicies.\\n\\nIn terms of monitoring,
      new [frameworks are\\nneeded](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      are more comprehensive, more pluralistic and which include value\\nconsiderations.
      In particular, [we have proposed that approaches to\\nassess OS](https://osf.io/4vgq5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      should aim to address\\nall aspects and values of OS: first, broadening out
      the battery of OS\\nactivities captured (from outputs/papers to processes/engagements);\\nsecond,
      opening up the monitoring to consider the diversity of possible\\nOS trajectories
      (which directions align with stated values? gold or\\ngreen? FAIR or CARE datasets?);
      third [contextualising the description\\nof\\nOS](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(e.g.
      high energy physics in Tokyo and applied agriculture in rural\\nIndia require
      different types of OS).\\n\\nIn terms of inequalities, an explicit monitoring
      on inclusiveness and\\ncollective benefits is crucial, because science has historically\\nexcluded
      some social groups (e.g. women and non-Westerners), as argued\\nby scholars
      such as [Sandra\\nHarding](https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1983/Sciences-from-BelowFeminisms-Postcolonialities-and){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,
      current research systems tend to produce, in relative terms, more\\nbenefits
      for the richer countries (e.g. in the field of [health\\nresearch](https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-00560-6){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nand

      Shanghai Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World\nUniversities
      (ARWU), was launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of\nCWTS at the time, sounded
      the alarm about the [problematic way in which\nthe ranking uses bibliometric\ndata](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\"_blank\"},
      for\ninstance in attributing publications to universities. In response to the\nShanghai
      Ranking, CWTS decided to launch the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      aiming to\ndemonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric data for comparing\nuniversities.
      While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same visibility\nas the Shanghai,
      THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation\nfor offering a robust,
      high-quality approach for comparing universities\nin terms of bibliometric parameters.\n\nToday,
      after almost two decades, the Leiden Ranking is going to take an\nambitious
      next step in improving bibliometric approaches for comparing\nuniversities.
      The [Open Edition of the Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      launched\ntoday by CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of\nbibliometric
      indicators: the lack of transparency of these indicators\ndue to their dependence
      on proprietary data. Together with the [Curtin\nOpen Knowledge Initiative\n(COKI)](https://openknowledge.community/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [Sesame Open\nScience](https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, CWTS has\nrebuilt
      the Leiden Ranking, making it fully transparent by working\nexclusively with
      open data and open source algorithms. Until now, the\nLeiden Ranking has always
      been based on data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      a proprietary data\nsource owned by Clarivate. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      uses data\nfrom [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, a fully
      open\ndata source created by OurResearch. To the best of our knowledge, the\nLeiden
      Ranking Open Edition is the first fully transparent university\nranking.\n\nThe
      importance of transparency of university rankings is widely\nrecognized. CWTS
      emphasizes the need to be transparent in [its ten rules\nfor ranking\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\"_blank\"}.\nTransparency
      also features prominently in the [criteria for fair and\nresponsible university\nrankings](https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\ndeveloped
      by the International Network of Research Management Societies\n(INORMS). These
      criteria were used in the [rethinking the rankings\ninitiative](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      transparency and openness are key elements in the [strategy\nfor culture change
      regarding university\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general,\nthe [UNESCO
      Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546){target=\"_blank\"}
      highlights\nthe need for \"open bibliometrics and scientometrics systems\".
      In a\nsimilar vein, the [Agreement on Reforming Research\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/){target=\"_blank\"}\nstresses
      the importance of \"independence and transparency of the data,\ninfrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\".\n\n### **How did we create
      the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking Open Edition aims to
      reproduce the traditional Leiden\nRanking as closely as possible, focusing on
      the [Leiden Ranking\n2023](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      was published in June last year. The Open Edition includes the same\n1411 universities
      that are also included in the Leiden Ranking 2023.\nInstead of proprietary data
      from Web of Science, the Open Edition uses\nopen data from OpenAlex. This data
      is harvested by OpenAlex from a\n[variety of\nsources](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview){target=\"_blank\"},\nincluding
      [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"},
      and the\nwebsites of publishers. The Open Edition is based on the [OpenAlex\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden
      Ranking Open\nEdition. We now discuss the different steps in this process.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tHy1PdjuQuLYS4xgQBtRL_vGkbfkfjP4MJxc8PDR3Ji_uHkaxSIWvR7okJ4aaxcoJnhj37sf_6OHphInlgRJfO7JhR57zNxHKxcAFA7Kx0ccdCupskFQSIHakH1Yqga5rMfwUGxn3retA5GrROG_PZQ\"\ndata-image=\"swcrdj3xmsq4\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"351\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Summary of the process
      of creating the Leiden\nRanking Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n**Core
      publications**\n\nWeb of Science and OpenAlex differ in their coverage of the
      scientific\nliterature. Most publications covered by Web of Science are also
      covered\nby OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications that Web of Science\ndoes
      not cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses on so-called core\npublications,
      which are identified based on a [number of\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      Open Edition also has a focus on core publications, identified based\non [similar\ncriteria](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nHowever,
      because of coverage differences between Web of Science and\nOpenAlex, the set
      of core publications considered in the Open Edition\ndiffers from the set of
      core publications considered in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking. This is discussed
      in more detail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n**Publication
      classification**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed algorithmic classification
      of\npublications into research areas. This classification is used to assign\npublications
      to main fields and to calculate normalized citation impact\nindicators. For
      the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of\npublications based on
      OpenAlex data. [This blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications){target=\"_blank\"}\nprovides
      more details.\n\n**CWTS organization registry**\n\nOpenAlex uses [ROR (Research
      Organization Registry)\nidentifiers](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"} for
      organizations, while\nthe Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal CWTS
      organization\nidentifiers. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization\nregistry
      by matching CWTS organization identifiers to ROR identifiers.\nThis was done
      for the 1411 universities included in the Open Edition and\nfor the [affiliated
      organizations linked to these\nuniversities](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAdditional
      links between universities and affiliated organizations were\nobtained from
      the ROR organization registry. Links between universities\nand their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on\nthe website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\"\ndata-image=\"uwb2iwqsd0wv\"

      of\npublications. We linked publications to universities by connecting ROR\nidentifiers
      obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers of\nuniversities and their affiliated
      organizations in the CWTS organization\nregistry. In [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}\nthe
      CWTS team presents a comparison between the approach for linking\npublications
      to universities used in the traditional Leiden Ranking and\nthe approach used
      in the Open Edition.\n\n**Indicators**\n\nThe Open Edition includes the same
      bibliometric indicators as the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking, except for [indicators
      of gender\ndiversity](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThese
      indicators are somewhat more challenging to produce using OpenAlex\ndata because
      OpenAlex does not make a distinction between first and last\nnames of authors.
      This distinction is important for algorithmic gender\ninference. At the moment
      gender diversity indicators are therefore not\nincluded in the Open Edition.
      We may add them in the future.\n\n### **How to access the data and software**\n\nThe
      data used to create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is [openly\navailable in\nZenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113){target=\"_blank\"}
      under\na [CC0 public domain\ndedication](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      data can also be [accessed through Google\nBigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\"_blank\"}\n(to
      run queries you need to have a BigQuery account and your own\nproject). Universities
      may for instance use the data to check whether\npublications have been correctly
      attributed to them. Performing such\nchecks is not possible in the case of the
      traditional Leiden Ranking,\nsince this ranking is based on proprietary data
      that cannot be shared\nopenly.\n\nThe source code of the software used to create
      the Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition is [openly available in\nGitHub](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nunder
      an MIT license. A Microsoft SQL Server database system was used to\nperform
      the data processing and the calculations. The source code\ntherefore consists
      mostly of SQL scripts.**  \n**\n\n### **How to compare the Open Edition with
      the traditional Leiden Ranking**\n\nTo what extent does the Open Edition provide
      results that are similar to\nthose provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking?
      To address this\nquestion, we have created an [interactive\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      which the values of the indicators in the two editions of the Leiden\nRanking
      can be easily compared.\n\nThe interactive dashboard can for instance be used
      to explore the\ncorrelation between the number of publications of a university
      in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3), or\nthe
      correlation between a university''s proportion of highly cited\npublications
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking (see Figure 4).  \n  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GNdAIHrl957GDdRDrD6fzTA8W-MHOBg_HeLyxOv9KpzoXVTVH0BuYhlkOWefvSzX038JqIOoOe9f_qy4WI-BUWTCXt5D0Ji7XzriBYYKWCjLz0CNxZuj_oeIJwWPtW6NHveE8SlaW2Zg8PgGB4rZOF8\"\ndata-image=\"v8py2m93129e\"

      general, we consider the correlations between indicator values in the\ntwo editions
      of the Leiden Ranking to be quite strong. However, for some\nuniversities there
      are large differences between the two editions of the\nLeiden Ranking. In many
      cases this is probably due to differences in the\npublications attributed to
      a university. This issue is analyzed in more\ndetail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      **What is next?**\n\nAt the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still
      of an\nexperimental nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful\nexercise
      for our organizations (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and\nOurResearch). We
      also expect to learn a lot from the feedback we hope to\nreceive from users
      of the Open Edition. Based on the lessons learned, we\nwill make further improvements
      to the Open Edition. Within one or two\nyears, we expect the Open Edition to
      be fully mature and to offer a full\nreplacement for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking.\n\nWhile our organisations are making further improvements to the Leiden\nRanking
      Open Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates of\nthe traditional
      Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next\none or two years,
      we expect the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open\nEdition to co-exist.
      In the somewhat longer term, CWTS will make a [full\ntransition to open research\ninformation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWithin
      the next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS,\nincluding
      those in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.\n\nThe transition of
      the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader\ndiscussions about openness
      of research information, responsible use of\nbibliometric indicators, and reform
      of research assessment. Critical\nreflection on the value of university rankings
      should be part of these\nimportant discussions.  \n\n### **How to get in touch**  {#how-to-get-in-touch}\n\nWould
      you like to know more about the Leiden Ranking Open Edition? CWTS\nis organizing

      the Shanghai Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World\nUniversities
      (ARWU), was launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of\nCWTS at the time, sounded
      the alarm about the [problematic way in which\nthe ranking uses bibliometric\ndata](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\"_blank\"},
      for\ninstance in attributing publications to universities. In response to the\nShanghai
      Ranking, CWTS decided to launch the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      aiming to\ndemonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric data for comparing\nuniversities.
      While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same visibility\nas the Shanghai,
      THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation\nfor offering a robust,
      high-quality approach for comparing universities\nin terms of bibliometric parameters.\n\nToday,
      after almost two decades, the Leiden Ranking is going to take an\nambitious
      next step in improving bibliometric approaches for comparing\nuniversities.
      The [Open Edition of the Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      launched\ntoday by CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of\nbibliometric
      indicators: the lack of transparency of these indicators\ndue to their dependence
      on proprietary data. Together with the [Curtin\nOpen Knowledge Initiative\n(COKI)](https://openknowledge.community/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [Sesame Open\nScience](https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, CWTS has\nrebuilt
      the Leiden Ranking, making it fully transparent by working\nexclusively with
      open data and open source algorithms. Until now, the\nLeiden Ranking has always
      been based on data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      a proprietary data\nsource owned by Clarivate. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      uses data\nfrom [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, a fully
      open\ndata source created by OurResearch. To the best of our knowledge, the\nLeiden
      Ranking Open Edition is the first fully transparent university\nranking.\n\nThe
      importance of transparency of university rankings is widely\nrecognized. CWTS
      emphasizes the need to be transparent in [its ten rules\nfor ranking\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\"_blank\"}.\nTransparency
      also features prominently in the [criteria for fair and\nresponsible university\nrankings](https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\ndeveloped
      by the International Network of Research Management Societies\n(INORMS). These
      criteria were used in the [rethinking the rankings\ninitiative](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      transparency and openness are key elements in the [strategy\nfor culture change
      regarding university\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general,\nthe [UNESCO
      Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546){target=\"_blank\"}
      highlights\nthe need for \"open bibliometrics and scientometrics systems\".
      In a\nsimilar vein, the [Agreement on Reforming Research\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/){target=\"_blank\"}\nstresses
      the importance of \"independence and transparency of the data,\ninfrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\".\n\n### **How did we create
      the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking Open Edition aims to
      reproduce the traditional Leiden\nRanking as closely as possible, focusing on
      the [Leiden Ranking\n2023](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      was published in June last year. The Open Edition includes the same\n1411 universities
      that are also included in the Leiden Ranking 2023.\nInstead of proprietary data
      from Web of Science, the Open Edition uses\nopen data from OpenAlex. This data
      is harvested by OpenAlex from a\n[variety of\nsources](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview){target=\"_blank\"},\nincluding
      [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"},
      and the\nwebsites of publishers. The Open Edition is based on the [OpenAlex\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden
      Ranking Open\nEdition. We now discuss the different steps in this process.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tHy1PdjuQuLYS4xgQBtRL_vGkbfkfjP4MJxc8PDR3Ji_uHkaxSIWvR7okJ4aaxcoJnhj37sf_6OHphInlgRJfO7JhR57zNxHKxcAFA7Kx0ccdCupskFQSIHakH1Yqga5rMfwUGxn3retA5GrROG_PZQ\"\ndata-image=\"swcrdj3xmsq4\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"351\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Summary of the process
      of creating the Leiden\nRanking Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n**Core
      publications**\n\nWeb of Science and OpenAlex differ in their coverage of the
      scientific\nliterature. Most publications covered by Web of Science are also
      covered\nby OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications that Web of Science\ndoes
      not cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses on so-called core\npublications,
      which are identified based on a [number of\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      Open Edition also has a focus on core publications, identified based\non [similar\ncriteria](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nHowever,
      because of coverage differences between Web of Science and\nOpenAlex, the set
      of core publications considered in the Open Edition\ndiffers from the set of
      core publications considered in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking. This is discussed
      in more detail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n**Publication
      classification**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed algorithmic classification
      of\npublications into research areas. This classification is used to assign\npublications
      to main fields and to calculate normalized citation impact\nindicators. For
      the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of\npublications based on
      OpenAlex data. [This blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications){target=\"_blank\"}\nprovides
      more details.\n\n**CWTS organization registry**\n\nOpenAlex uses [ROR (Research
      Organization Registry)\nidentifiers](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"} for
      organizations, while\nthe Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal CWTS
      organization\nidentifiers. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization\nregistry
      by matching CWTS organization identifiers to ROR identifiers.\nThis was done
      for the 1411 universities included in the Open Edition and\nfor the [affiliated
      organizations linked to these\nuniversities](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAdditional
      links between universities and affiliated organizations were\nobtained from
      the ROR organization registry. Links between universities\nand their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on\nthe website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\"\ndata-image=\"uwb2iwqsd0wv\"

      Amsterdam and its\naffiliated organisations.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**  \nPublication-university
      links**\n\nOpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for the affiliations of authors
      of\npublications. We linked publications to universities by connecting ROR\nidentifiers
      obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers of\nuniversities and their affiliated
      organizations in the CWTS organization\nregistry. In [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}\nthe
      CWTS team presents a comparison between the approach for linking\npublications
      to universities used in the traditional Leiden Ranking and\nthe approach used
      in the Open Edition.\n\n**Indicators**\n\nThe Open Edition includes the same
      bibliometric indicators as the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking, except for [indicators
      of gender\ndiversity](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThese
      indicators are somewhat more challenging to produce using OpenAlex\ndata because
      OpenAlex does not make a distinction between first and last\nnames of authors.
      This distinction is important for algorithmic gender\ninference. At the moment
      gender diversity indicators are therefore not\nincluded in the Open Edition.
      We may add them in the future.\n\n### **How to access the data and software**\n\nThe
      data used to create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is [openly\navailable in\nZenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113){target=\"_blank\"}
      under\na [CC0 public domain\ndedication](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      data can also be [accessed through Google\nBigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\"_blank\"}\n(to
      run queries you need to have a BigQuery account and your own\nproject). Universities
      may for instance use the data to check whether\npublications have been correctly
      attributed to them. Performing such\nchecks is not possible in the case of the
      traditional Leiden Ranking,\nsince this ranking is based on proprietary data
      that cannot be shared\nopenly.\n\nThe source code of the software used to create
      the Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition is [openly available in\nGitHub](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nunder
      an MIT license. A Microsoft SQL Server database system was used to\nperform
      the data processing and the calculations. The source code\ntherefore consists
      mostly of SQL scripts.**  \n**\n\n### **How to compare the Open Edition with
      the traditional Leiden Ranking**\n\nTo what extent does the Open Edition provide
      results that are similar to\nthose provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking?
      To address this\nquestion, we have created an [interactive\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      which the values of the indicators in the two editions of the Leiden\nRanking
      can be easily compared.\n\nThe interactive dashboard can for instance be used
      to explore the\ncorrelation between the number of publications of a university
      in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3), or\nthe
      correlation between a university''s proportion of highly cited\npublications
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking (see Figure 4).  \n  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GNdAIHrl957GDdRDrD6fzTA8W-MHOBg_HeLyxOv9KpzoXVTVH0BuYhlkOWefvSzX038JqIOoOe9f_qy4WI-BUWTCXt5D0Ji7XzriBYYKWCjLz0CNxZuj_oeIJwWPtW6NHveE8SlaW2Zg8PgGB4rZOF8\"\ndata-image=\"v8py2m93129e\"

      Leiden Ranking\nand in the Open Edition (fractional counting).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nIn
      general, we consider the correlations between indicator values in the\ntwo editions
      of the Leiden Ranking to be quite strong. However, for some\nuniversities there
      are large differences between the two editions of the\nLeiden Ranking. In many
      cases this is probably due to differences in the\npublications attributed to
      a university. This issue is analyzed in more\ndetail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      **What is next?**\n\nAt the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still
      of an\nexperimental nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful\nexercise
      for our organizations (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and\nOurResearch). We
      also expect to learn a lot from the feedback we hope to\nreceive from users
      of the Open Edition. Based on the lessons learned, we\nwill make further improvements
      to the Open Edition. Within one or two\nyears, we expect the Open Edition to
      be fully mature and to offer a full\nreplacement for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking.\n\nWhile our organisations are making further improvements to the Leiden\nRanking
      Open Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates of\nthe traditional
      Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next\none or two years,
      we expect the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open\nEdition to co-exist.
      In the somewhat longer term, CWTS will make a [full\ntransition to open research\ninformation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWithin
      the next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS,\nincluding
      those in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.\n\nThe transition of
      the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader\ndiscussions about openness
      of research information, responsible use of\nbibliometric indicators, and reform
      of research assessment. Critical\nreflection on the value of university rankings
      should be part of these\nimportant discussions.  \n\n### **How to get in touch**  {#how-to-get-in-touch}\n\nWould
      you like to know more about the Leiden Ranking Open Edition? CWTS\nis organizing

      the Shanghai Ranking, also known as the Academic Ranking of World\nUniversities
      (ARWU), was launched in 2003, Ton van Raan, director of\nCWTS at the time, sounded
      the alarm about the [problematic way in which\nthe ranking uses bibliometric\ndata](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\"_blank\"},
      for\ninstance in attributing publications to universities. In response to the\nShanghai
      Ranking, CWTS decided to launch the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      aiming to\ndemonstrate more appropriate ways to use bibliometric data for comparing\nuniversities.
      While the Leiden Ranking did not gain the same visibility\nas the Shanghai,
      THE, and QS rankings, it developed a strong reputation\nfor offering a robust,
      high-quality approach for comparing universities\nin terms of bibliometric parameters.\n\nToday,
      after almost two decades, the Leiden Ranking is going to take an\nambitious
      next step in improving bibliometric approaches for comparing\nuniversities.
      The [Open Edition of the Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      launched\ntoday by CWTS, addresses one of the most challenging problems of\nbibliometric
      indicators: the lack of transparency of these indicators\ndue to their dependence
      on proprietary data. Together with the [Curtin\nOpen Knowledge Initiative\n(COKI)](https://openknowledge.community/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [Sesame Open\nScience](https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, CWTS has\nrebuilt
      the Leiden Ranking, making it fully transparent by working\nexclusively with
      open data and open source algorithms. Until now, the\nLeiden Ranking has always
      been based on data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      a proprietary data\nsource owned by Clarivate. The Leiden Ranking Open Edition
      uses data\nfrom [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, a fully
      open\ndata source created by OurResearch. To the best of our knowledge, the\nLeiden
      Ranking Open Edition is the first fully transparent university\nranking.\n\nThe
      importance of transparency of university rankings is widely\nrecognized. CWTS
      emphasizes the need to be transparent in [its ten rules\nfor ranking\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\"_blank\"}.\nTransparency
      also features prominently in the [criteria for fair and\nresponsible university\nrankings](https://inorms.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principles-for-fair-and-responsible-university-assessment-v5.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\ndeveloped
      by the International Network of Research Management Societies\n(INORMS). These
      criteria were used in the [rethinking the rankings\ninitiative](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      transparency and openness are key elements in the [strategy\nfor culture change
      regarding university\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/ranking-the-university){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      is currently being implemented in the Netherlands. More in general,\nthe [UNESCO
      Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546){target=\"_blank\"}
      highlights\nthe need for \"open bibliometrics and scientometrics systems\".
      In a\nsimilar vein, the [Agreement on Reforming Research\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/){target=\"_blank\"}\nstresses
      the importance of \"independence and transparency of the data,\ninfrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment\".\n\n### **How did we create
      the Leiden Ranking Open Edition?**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking Open Edition aims to
      reproduce the traditional Leiden\nRanking as closely as possible, focusing on
      the [Leiden Ranking\n2023](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      was published in June last year. The Open Edition includes the same\n1411 universities
      that are also included in the Leiden Ranking 2023.\nInstead of proprietary data
      from Web of Science, the Open Edition uses\nopen data from OpenAlex. This data
      is harvested by OpenAlex from a\n[variety of\nsources](https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/entities-overview){target=\"_blank\"},\nincluding
      [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"},
      and the\nwebsites of publishers. The Open Edition is based on the [OpenAlex\nsnapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of creating the Leiden
      Ranking Open\nEdition. We now discuss the different steps in this process.\n\n<figure
      style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tHy1PdjuQuLYS4xgQBtRL_vGkbfkfjP4MJxc8PDR3Ji_uHkaxSIWvR7okJ4aaxcoJnhj37sf_6OHphInlgRJfO7JhR57zNxHKxcAFA7Kx0ccdCupskFQSIHakH1Yqga5rMfwUGxn3retA5GrROG_PZQ\"\ndata-image=\"swcrdj3xmsq4\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"351\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Summary of the process
      of creating the Leiden\nRanking Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n**Core
      publications**\n\nWeb of Science and OpenAlex differ in their coverage of the
      scientific\nliterature. Most publications covered by Web of Science are also
      covered\nby OpenAlex, but OpenAlex covers many publications that Web of Science\ndoes
      not cover. The traditional Leiden Ranking focuses on so-called core\npublications,
      which are identified based on a [number of\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      Open Edition also has a focus on core publications, identified based\non [similar\ncriteria](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nHowever,
      because of coverage differences between Web of Science and\nOpenAlex, the set
      of core publications considered in the Open Edition\ndiffers from the set of
      core publications considered in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking. This is discussed
      in more detail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n**Publication
      classification**\n\nThe Leiden Ranking relies on a detailed algorithmic classification
      of\npublications into research areas. This classification is used to assign\npublications
      to main fields and to calculate normalized citation impact\nindicators. For
      the Open Edition, CWTS created a new classification of\npublications based on
      OpenAlex data. [This blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications){target=\"_blank\"}\nprovides
      more details.\n\n**CWTS organization registry**\n\nOpenAlex uses [ROR (Research
      Organization Registry)\nidentifiers](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"} for
      organizations, while\nthe Leiden Ranking has traditionally used internal CWTS
      organization\nidentifiers. For the Open Edition, CWTS created a new organization\nregistry
      by matching CWTS organization identifiers to ROR identifiers.\nThis was done
      for the 1411 universities included in the Open Edition and\nfor the [affiliated
      organizations linked to these\nuniversities](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAdditional
      links between universities and affiliated organizations were\nobtained from
      the ROR organization registry. Links between universities\nand their affiliated
      organizations are presented in a transparent way on\nthe website of the Open
      Edition (see Figure 2).  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VjpSp7dpbdBJKP1aRBdINJ4IzoRdB0W9i1Nyb8ZTbyiT_avm6-892DopQpVUKpwoInEXPBI-NVW7rrW9y-5yKLSlIpv7S68l6xfrYUn87rwcPpM0oHcsi8IeWgyjFEUO5H8UqirPzjgMqpbF4Pcec9A\"\ndata-image=\"uwb2iwqsd0wv\"

      of the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition showing the links between University of
      Amsterdam and its\naffiliated organisations.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**  \nPublication-university
      links**\n\nOpenAlex provides ROR identifiers for the affiliations of authors
      of\npublications. We linked publications to universities by connecting ROR\nidentifiers
      obtained from OpenAlex to the ROR identifiers of\nuniversities and their affiliated
      organizations in the CWTS organization\nregistry. In [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}\nthe
      CWTS team presents a comparison between the approach for linking\npublications
      to universities used in the traditional Leiden Ranking and\nthe approach used
      in the Open Edition.\n\n**Indicators**\n\nThe Open Edition includes the same
      bibliometric indicators as the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking, except for [indicators
      of gender\ndiversity](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#gender-indicators){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThese
      indicators are somewhat more challenging to produce using OpenAlex\ndata because
      OpenAlex does not make a distinction between first and last\nnames of authors.
      This distinction is important for algorithmic gender\ninference. At the moment
      gender diversity indicators are therefore not\nincluded in the Open Edition.
      We may add them in the future.\n\n### **How to access the data and software**\n\nThe
      data used to create the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is [openly\navailable in\nZenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579113){target=\"_blank\"}
      under\na [CC0 public domain\ndedication](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      data can also be [accessed through Google\nBigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1scwts-leiden!2sleiden_ranking_open_edition_2023){target=\"_blank\"}\n(to
      run queries you need to have a BigQuery account and your own\nproject). Universities
      may for instance use the data to check whether\npublications have been correctly
      attributed to them. Performing such\nchecks is not possible in the case of the
      traditional Leiden Ranking,\nsince this ranking is based on proprietary data
      that cannot be shared\nopenly.\n\nThe source code of the software used to create
      the Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition is [openly available in\nGitHub](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/CWTS-Leiden-Ranking-Open-Edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nunder
      an MIT license. A Microsoft SQL Server database system was used to\nperform
      the data processing and the calculations. The source code\ntherefore consists
      mostly of SQL scripts.**  \n**\n\n### **How to compare the Open Edition with
      the traditional Leiden Ranking**\n\nTo what extent does the Open Edition provide
      results that are similar to\nthose provided by the traditional Leiden Ranking?
      To address this\nquestion, we have created an [interactive\ndashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODg0YWM2MzEtMmVlNS00NzEyLWE2YjMtMTIxM2Y3ZjMxYTJkIiwidCI6ImNhMmE3Zjc2LWRiZDctNGVjMC05MTA4LTZiM2Q1MjRmYjdjOCIsImMiOjh9){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      which the values of the indicators in the two editions of the Leiden\nRanking
      can be easily compared.\n\nThe interactive dashboard can for instance be used
      to explore the\ncorrelation between the number of publications of a university
      in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking and in the Open Edition (see Figure 3), or\nthe
      correlation between a university''s proportion of highly cited\npublications
      in the two editions of the Leiden Ranking (see Figure 4).  \n  \n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GNdAIHrl957GDdRDrD6fzTA8W-MHOBg_HeLyxOv9KpzoXVTVH0BuYhlkOWefvSzX038JqIOoOe9f_qy4WI-BUWTCXt5D0Ji7XzriBYYKWCjLz0CNxZuj_oeIJwWPtW6NHveE8SlaW2Zg8PgGB4rZOF8\"\ndata-image=\"v8py2m93129e\"

      general, we consider the correlations between indicator values in the\ntwo editions
      of the Leiden Ranking to be quite strong. However, for some\nuniversities there
      are large differences between the two editions of the\nLeiden Ranking. In many
      cases this is probably due to differences in the\npublications attributed to
      a university. This issue is analyzed in more\ndetail in [this blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/opening-up-the-cwts-leiden-ranking-toward-a-decentralized-and-open-model-for-data-curation){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      **What is next?**\n\nAt the moment the Leiden Ranking Open Edition is still
      of an\nexperimental nature. Building the ranking was an incredibly useful\nexercise
      for our organizations (CWTS, COKI, Sesame Open Science, and\nOurResearch). We
      also expect to learn a lot from the feedback we hope to\nreceive from users
      of the Open Edition. Based on the lessons learned, we\nwill make further improvements
      to the Open Edition. Within one or two\nyears, we expect the Open Edition to
      be fully mature and to offer a full\nreplacement for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking.\n\nWhile our organisations are making further improvements to the Leiden\nRanking
      Open Edition, CWTS will continue to release annual updates of\nthe traditional
      Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data. In the next\none or two years,
      we expect the traditional Leiden Ranking and the Open\nEdition to co-exist.
      In the somewhat longer term, CWTS will make a [full\ntransition to open research\ninformation](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWithin
      the next few years, all bibliometric indicators produced by CWTS,\nincluding
      those in the Leiden Ranking, will be based on open data.\n\nThe transition of
      the Leiden Ranking toward open data fits into broader\ndiscussions about openness
      of research information, responsible use of\nbibliometric indicators, and reform
      of research assessment. Critical\nreflection on the value of university rankings
      should be part of these\nimportant discussions.  \n\n### **How to get in touch**  {#how-to-get-in-touch}\n\nWould

      the transparency of university rankings is widely\nrecognized, for instance
      in the [ten rules for ranking\nuniversities](https://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1368350){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      we published in 2017, in the work done by the [INORMS Research\nEvaluation Working\nGroup](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      also in a [recent report by a Dutch expert group on university\nrankings](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/publications/Ranking_the_university_ENG.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n(co-authored
      by one of us). It is therefore not surprising that the\n[announcement of the
      Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      2023 got [considerable\nattention](https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-universities-2023-9-leiden-rankings-to-add-open-source-version-in-2024/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      triggered lots of highly supportive responses.\n\nThe announcement also led
      to questions about the quality of the data\nused in the [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      in particular\nthe affiliation data for linking publications to universities.
      In this\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\nreleased\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\n\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\n\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"325\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 3. Percentage of publications
      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge

      Open Edition of the CWTS Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-cwts-leiden-ranking-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      2023 got [considerable\nattention](https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-universities-2023-9-leiden-rankings-to-add-open-source-version-in-2024/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      triggered lots of highly supportive responses.\n\nThe announcement also led
      to questions about the quality of the data\nused in the [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      in particular\nthe affiliation data for linking publications to universities.
      In this\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\nreleased\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\n\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\n\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"

      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge
      Initiative (COKI),\nSesame Open Science, OurResearch, SIRIS Academic, and Sorbonne\nUniversity

      2023 got [considerable\nattention](https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-universities-2023-9-leiden-rankings-to-add-open-source-version-in-2024/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      triggered lots of highly supportive responses.\n\nThe announcement also led
      to questions about the quality of the data\nused in the [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      in particular\nthe affiliation data for linking publications to universities.
      In this\npost, we address these questions by distinguishing between two models\nfor
      curating affiliation data: the centralized and closed model and the\ndecentralized
      and open model. While the traditional Leiden Ranking\nrelies primarily on the
      centralized and closed model, the [Open Edition\nreleased\ntoday](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"}\nrepresents
      a movement toward the decentralized and open model.\n\n### **The centralized
      and closed model for data curation**\n\nIn the centralized and closed model,
      a central actor in the system takes\nresponsibility for data curation. The data
      is closed. It can be accessed\nonly by selected users, who typically need to
      pay to get access.\n\nThe [traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on\nclosed data from [Web of\nScience](https://webofscience.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a mostly\ncentralized approach to curating affiliation data. While some
      basic data\ncuration (standardizing affiliation strings) is performed by Web
      of\nScience, the bulk of the work is done by CWTS (determining which\nstandardized
      affiliation strings refer to the same ''unified\norganizations''). Because Web
      of Science data is closed, CWTS is unable\nto share the curated data. This means
      there is no easy way for\nuniversities to check the quality of the data.\n\n###
      **The decentralized and open model for data curation**\n\nIn the decentralized
      and open model, data curation takes place in a\ndecentralized way. Different
      actors in the system take responsibility\nfor different parts of the data curation
      process. All data is fully\nopen, which facilitates collaboration between the
      different actors.\n\nThe [Leiden Ranking Open\nEdition](https://open.leidenranking.com){target=\"_blank\"},
      based on open\ndata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      takes a\nmostly decentralized approach to curating affiliation data.\nContributions
      to the data curation process are made by a number of\ndifferent actors:\n\n-
      The [Research Organization Registry\n  (ROR)](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      provides ROR IDs for\n  research organizations.\n- Publishers deposit publication
      metadata, including author\n  affiliations, to\n  [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n  [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n- Crossref
      and PubMed make publication metadata, including author\n  affiliations, openly
      available.\n- OpenAlex ingests author affiliations from Crossref and PubMed.
      It\n  performs web scraping to obtain missing author affiliations. It then\n  uses
      a [machine learning\n  algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppbKRVtyneWc7Hjpo8TOm57YLGx1C2Oo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112616748913247881031&rtpof=true&sd=true){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      map affiliation strings to ROR IDs.\n- CWTS maps ROR IDs to ''unified organizations''.
      For instance, the ROR\n  IDs of Leiden University\n  ([https://ror.org/027bh9e22](https://ror.org/027bh9e22){target=\"_blank\"})\n  and
      Leiden University Medical Center\n  ([https://ror.org/05xvt9f17](https://ror.org/05xvt9f17){target=\"_blank\"})\n  are
      both mapped to Leiden University, since the Leiden Ranking\n  considers Leiden
      University Medical Center to be part of Leiden\n  University.\n\nThe above actors
      all share data openly. This enables research\norganizations to check the quality
      of the data and to contribute to the\ndata curation process by reporting data
      quality problems to the relevant\nactors (e.g., ROR, OpenAlex, or CWTS).\n\n###
      **How much difference does it make?**\n\nOver the past months, many people have
      asked us to what extent results\nobtained from the data curation approach taken
      in the Leiden Ranking\nOpen Edition are different from results obtained from
      the data curation\napproach of the traditional Leiden Ranking. To answer this
      question, we\nmatch publications in OpenAlex and Web of Science based on DOIs
      and we\nthen use this matching to compare the results obtained using the two\ndata
      curation approaches. Our focus is on publications from the period\n2018-2021.\n\nWe
      first compare the overall set of publications included in the\ntraditional Leiden
      Ranking to the overall set of publications included\nin the Open Edition. The
      traditional Leiden Ranking includes all\npublications in Web of Science that
      are indexed in the Science Citation\nIndex, the Social Sciences Citation Index,
      or the Arts & Humanities\nCitation Index, that are classified as research article
      or review\narticle, and that meet a [number of additional\ncriteria](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      the OpenEdition includes all publications in OpenAlex that are\nclassified as
      article or book chapter, that have affiliation and\nreference metadata (for
      some publications this metadata is missing in\nOpenAlex), and that meet [additional
      criteria similar to those used in\nthe traditional Leiden\nRanking](https://open.leidenranking.com/information/indicators#publications){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFigure
      1 shows the overlap of the two sets of publications.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CHqAQGjgvLm3dbRODzOG9mn5JESRP3uMrhJmchomD5v76-VpTFlHMRSkmTqT-sfQNHGwU1iClTRujekbBzWjsiouoXpA0VVwdXxoCaXrfb5X7U6-tBxrP6NDE8gTtv2-jD68dI00r2z_YrFZXXAQKbY\"\ndata-image=\"l1wpg7hao3a3\"
      width=\"624\" height=\"369\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Overlap of publications
      in the traditional Leiden\nRanking and the Open Edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nOf
      the 9.3 million publications included in the Open Edition, 2.5\nmillion (27%)
      are not included in the traditional Leiden Ranking. The\nmost important reason
      is that publications are not covered by the Web of\nScience citation indexes
      on which the traditional Leiden Ranking is\nbased (i.e., Science Citation Index,
      Social Sciences Citation Index, and\nArts & Humanities Citation Index). This
      explains why 1.7 million\npublications (19%) included in the Open Edition are
      not included in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nConversely, of the 7.4 million
      publications included in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking, 0.7 million (9%) are
      not included in the Open Edition.\nThere are several reasons for this. Inconsistencies
      in publication years\n(e.g., a publication was published in 2017 according to
      OpenAlex, while\nit was published in 2018 according to Web of Science) are an
      important\nreason, explaining why 0.2 million publications (3%) are not included
      in\nthe Open Edition while they are included in the traditional Leiden\nRanking.
      However, the most important reason is missing affiliation data\nin OpenAlex.
      0.3 million publications (4%) are not included in the Open\nEdition because
      of missing author affiliations in OpenAlex, showing that\nmissing affiliation
      data is a weakness of OpenAlex.\n\nWe now provide a more detailed analysis for
      the 6.8 million publications\nthat are included in both the traditional Leiden
      Ranking and the Open\nEdition. For each of the 1411 universities in the Leiden
      Ranking 2023,\nwe calculated the percentage of the publications of the university
      in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking that are not assigned to the university\nin
      the Open Edition. Figure 2 shows this percentage for each university,\nsorted
      from the highest to the lowest percentage.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q_4hGJHVdGtbi70hiQibR97Vq2jPeqat5VEg2Yb_NxjPHvV2QDYG0y_CgMBJugZPWVueKbNdRTzKdlahHXYKK8uvYwMyFZH5oExC-E523URNkjAAjn9vvlY_s3nl63C6DuBlpbAPS8iA3uLjuCUhzJA\"\ndata-image=\"5mzsuc7ddn0q\"

      the university in\nthe Open Edition. Each dot represents one university.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nFigure
      2 shows there are three universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking are not assigned to\nthe university in the
      Open Edition. In two cases this appears to be due\nto errors in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking, while in one case this\nseems to be due to errors in the Open
      Edition. There are 88 universities\nfor which between 10% and 30% of the publications
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking are not assigned to the university in the
      Open Edition.\nFor the other 1320 universities this is the case for less than
      10% of\nthe publications in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\n\nWe manually examined
      a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity in the traditional
      Leiden Ranking but not in the Open\nEdition. For this small sample, we found
      that in 6 cases (24%) the\nassignment in the traditional Leiden Ranking was
      incorrect (because of\nan error made by either Web of Science or CWTS). In the
      other 19 cases\n(76%), an assignment incorrectly had not been made in the Open
      Edition\n(in most cases because of either a missing author affiliation in\nOpenAlex
      or an error in the mapping performed by OpenAlex from an\naffiliation string
      to a ROR ID).\n\nFigure 3 offers the opposite perspective of Figure 2. For each
      of the\n1411 universities, we calculated the percentage of the publications
      of\nthe university in the Leiden Ranking Open Edition that are not assigned\nto
      the university in the traditional Leiden Ranking. These percentages\nare shown
      in Figure 3, again sorted from highest to lowest.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bCKUeAEVXRMqIubriEQXAWV4Q6p9RJdP1b47PGy07PlaSn_dGk-h_R6CXUnqGfP8w1Vjpn4Ye7hIgusecYUjheB2f3ksxiFksFmgq_ovUJWSQc-xDOOCLCgp_loyQT4KoYyg5Vx9K-drDS-0f7Qs93w\"\ndata-image=\"a5nylq4rwvuy\"

      of a university in the\nOpen Edition that are not assigned to the university
      in the traditional\nLeiden Ranking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAs Figure
      3 shows, there are 14 universities for which more than 30% of\nthe publications
      in the Open Edition are not assigned to the university\nin the traditional Leiden
      Ranking. In about two-thirds of the cases this\nappears to be due to errors
      in the Open Edition, while in the other\ncases this seems to be due to errors
      in the traditional Leiden Ranking.\nThere are 91 universities for which between
      10% and 30% of the\npublications in the Open Edition are not assigned to the
      university in\nthe traditional Leiden Ranking. For the other 1306 universities
      this is\nthe case for less than 10% of the publications in the Open Edition.\n\nIn
      a manual analysis of a random sample of 25 publications assigned to a\nuniversity
      in the Open Edition but not in the traditional Leiden\nRanking, we found that
      in 19 cases (76%) the assignment in the Open\nEdition was incorrect (in most
      cases because of an error in the mapping\nperformed by OpenAlex from an affiliation
      string to a ROR ID). In the\nother 6 cases (24%), an assignment incorrectly
      had not been made in the\ntraditional Leiden Ranking (for a variety of reasons).\n\nIn
      summary, for publications included in both the traditional Leiden\nRanking and
      the Open Edition, our findings show that for most\nuniversities the data curation
      yields similar results in the two\neditions of the ranking. When there are differences,
      errors are about\nthree times more likely in the Open Edition than in the traditional\nLeiden
      Ranking.\n\n### **Room for improvement**\n\nThe bibliometric community has extensive
      experience with the centralized\nand closed model for data curation. Over the
      years, databases such as\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions have made considerable\ninvestments
      in this model. Research organizations have also made large\ninvestments in it,
      both by paying to get access to the above-mentioned\ndatabases and by helping
      these databases improve their data (e.g., by\nreporting data quality problems,
      such as publications that are assigned\nto an incorrect organization). Likewise,
      by performing extensive\ncuration of affiliation data for the traditional Leiden
      Ranking based on\nWeb of Science data, CWTS has also invested substantially
      in a mostly\ncentralized approach to data curation.\n\nThe bibliometric community
      has less experience with the decentralized\nand open model for data curation.
      Nevertheless, the results presented\nabove show that the quality of affiliation
      data obtained through a more\ndecentralized approach is already quite good.
      Moreover, there are lots\nof opportunities to further improve the data quality.
      Different actors\ncan contribute to this in different ways:\n\n- OpenAlex can
      contribute by making further improvements to the\n  completeness of its affiliation
      data and to the machine learning\n  algorithm it uses to map affiliation strings
      to ROR IDs.\n- Research organizations can contribute by reporting data quality\n  problems
      to OpenAlex. This will help OpenAlex to improve the quality\n  of its data.
      Because OpenAlex data is open, anyone can identify\n  problems in the data.
      This is different for closed databases, where\n  only those who pay to get access
      to a database can identify problems.\n- Publishers can contribute by attaching
      ROR IDs to author affiliations\n  in publications and by [depositing not only
      affiliation strings but\n  also ROR IDs to\n  Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/community/ror/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n  Several
      publishers, for instance Optica Publishing Group and eLife,\n  have already
      started to do this. This enables OpenAlex to ingest ROR\n  IDs from Crossref
      instead of inferring these IDs algorithmically.\n- CWTS and other providers
      of bibliometric analytics can contribute by\n  monitoring the quality of the
      affiliation data obtained from OpenAlex\n  and by providing feedback to OpenAlex.
      If necessary, providers of\n  bibliometric analytics can perform their own curation
      of affiliation\n  data as a complement or substitute to the data curation performed
      by\n  OpenAlex.\n- All actors in the system can contribute by working together
      with ROR\n  to make improvements to the registry. In particular, research\n  organizations
      can make an essential contribution by providing\n  authoritative curations on
      the relationships between institutions and\n  their constituent parts.\n\n###
      **The power of the decentralized and open model**\n\nWe seem to have reached
      the limits of what can be achieved using the\ncentralized and closed model for
      curating affiliation data. While for\ncertain use cases the model may yield
      an acceptable data quality, the\nmodel is also highly resource-demanding, non-transparent,
      and\ninflexible.\n\nAlthough the decentralized and open model is still in an
      early stage of\ndevelopment, it already yields a surprisingly good data quality.\nMoreover,
      by distributing the responsibility for different parts of the\ndata curation
      process to different actors in the system, the model is\nmore efficient and
      scalable than the centralized and closed model. On\ntop of this, the decentralized
      and open model facilitates transparency\nand accountability, and offers the
      flexibility needed to address\ndifferent use cases that require different choices
      to be made in the\ndata curation process. Finally, the decentralized and open
      model ensures\nthat investments in data curation benefit the global academic
      community\ninstead of increasing the value of proprietary data sources.\n\nBy
      [opening up the Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-leiden-ranking-open-edition){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      are moving toward a powerful new model for curating affiliation data.\nWe invite
      universities to critically examine the affiliation data used\nin the Leiden
      Ranking Open Edition. Feedback from universities will help\nto further develop
      the decentralized and open model for data curation\nand to realize the highest
      possible data quality.  \n\n*We thank colleagues at the Curtin Open Knowledge

      areas\nis crucial for many bibliometric analyses. While there are lots of\napproaches
      for classifying publications, most of these approaches lack\ntransparency. Although
      there are exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|
      resolution_micro_level | 2.2e-6  |\n| resolution_meso_level  | 4.9e-7  |\n|
      resolution_macro_level | 2.2e-8  |\n| threshold_micro_level  |  1,000  |\n|  threshold_meso_level  |
      10,000  |\n| threshold_macro_level  | 500,000 |\n|      n_iterations      |   100   |\n\n[Table
      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      Summary     | This cluster of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying
      research\npublications into research areas: Our approach relies on open data
      from\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\nclassification
      is [openly\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      work presented in this blog post is part of an [ambitious\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      have at CWTS to move to fully open approaches to bibliometrics, and\nto openness
      of research information and research analytics more\ngenerally.\n\nThe publication
      classification discussed in this blog post is a crucial\nbuilding block for
      the Open Edition of the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS is\ngoing to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the\nOpenAlex team as a foundation for a [new topic classification for\nOpenAlex](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      hope our work will help to advance the transition to open approaches\nto bibliometrics!  \n",

      research publications into research topics or research areas\nis crucial for

      publications, most of these approaches lack\ntransparency. Although there are
      exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|

      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying
      research\npublications into research areas: Our approach relies on open data
      from\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\nclassification
      is [openly\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      work presented in this blog post is part of an [ambitious\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      have at CWTS to move to fully open approaches to bibliometrics, and\nto openness
      of research information and research analytics more\ngenerally.\n\nThe publication
      classification discussed in this blog post is a crucial\nbuilding block for
      the Open Edition of the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS is\ngoing to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the\nOpenAlex team as a foundation for a [new topic classification for\nOpenAlex](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      hope our work will help to advance the transition to open approaches\nto bibliometrics!  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|

      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      Summary     | This cluster of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research
      evaluation, and the assessment of scientific impact. It covers topics such as
      citation networks, collaboration patterns, open access publishing, social impact
      assessment, altmetrics, co-authorship networks, and interdisciplinary research
      |\n| Wikipedia   | [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\"_blank\"}                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n[Table
      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"39511\" />\n</figure>\n\n[Figure 1. Landscape of science showing
      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying
      research\npublications into research areas: Our approach relies on open data
      from\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\nclassification
      is [openly\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      work presented in this blog post is part of an [ambitious\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      have at CWTS to move to fully open approaches to bibliometrics, and\nto openness
      of research information and research analytics more\ngenerally.\n\nThe publication
      classification discussed in this blog post is a crucial\nbuilding block for
      the Open Edition of the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS is\ngoing to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the\nOpenAlex team as a foundation for a [new topic classification for\nOpenAlex](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      hope our work will help to advance the transition to open approaches\nto bibliometrics!  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      "How to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic X? How to\nevaluate
      the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish\nnew strategic
      priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\nof the many important
      decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\nand science policy makers
      need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\nthese are increasingly made in
      data-driven ways, guided by research\nanalytics ranging from simple scientometric
      indicators and university\nrankings to complex dashboards that bring together
      data from a variety\nof sources.\n\n### The Information & Openness focal area
      {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\n\nLast year the Information & Openness
      focal area was established at CWTS.\nIn this focal area we are concerned with
      the complex interplay between\ndecision making processes in science, the information
      used in these\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in terms of properties\nsuch
      as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership. This\ncomplex interplay
      is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\nwith global aspirations:
      open science and responsible research\nassessment. Our work in the focal area
      builds on decades of experience\nwe have at CWTS in using scientometric data
      to support research\nassessment and strategic decision making in science. Having
      been at the\nforefront of developments in scientometrics, we not only have a
      lot of\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators, and algorithms,\nbut
      we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics plays\nin all kinds
      of decision-making processes.\n\nBuilding on our experience and recognizing
      that decisions in science are\nincreasingly being made in data-driven ways,
      the Information & Openness\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\nof data in decision making processes in science. We are
      interested in\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and how
      these\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research information
      more\ngenerally.\n\n### **Three pillars**\n\nIn line with the organization of
      the\u00a0[broader knowledge agenda of\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width:
      100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\nbroad goal of
      developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\ninformation the norm and to
      enable more transparent and responsible\napproaches to decision making in science.
      An example is the\ntransformation of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\nresulting in a fully
      transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\nrelease of the Open Edition
      of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\nthis month, on January 30. Another
      example is the launch of the course<a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\n<a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\ncoming months.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\nfuture scientometric analyses performed
      by our center will use only data\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref, DataCite,
      ORCID, OpenAlex,\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part of a broader
      ambition\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the way we\ncommunicate
      about our research and about other activities of our center.\nThis will also
      include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open\nscience</a>
      and <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### **Our way of working**\n\nThe
      team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of more than\n20 CWTS
      colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities in\nthe understanding
      pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\npracticing pillars. We
      meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\ndevelopments around open research
      information, to share updates on\nongoing projects and other activities, and
      to make plans for new\ninitiatives.\n\nOur work also aims to contribute to strengthening
      the other two focal\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\nInclusion in
      Global\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe

      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and

      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested

      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\\noutline our

      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
      way we\\ncommunicate about our research and about other activities of our center.\\nThis
      will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\\\">open\\nscience</a>

      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other

      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
      way we\\ncommunicate about our research and about other activities of our center.\\nThis
      will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\\\">open\\nscience</a>
      and <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\\\">research\\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n### **Our way of
      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\\nInclusion in
      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS
      project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and the\\n[CoARA working
      group on Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research\\nAssessment\\n(OI4RRA)](https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\\n\\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\\nresearch information
      into practice (e.g.,\\n[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[COKI](https://open.coki.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      as\nevidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific advances in our\nunderstanding
      of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific\nfindings were part of
      broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal\nproponents and opponents in
      contentious and sometimes polarised\nsettings. Although very visible during
      the COVID-19 pandemic, science\nalso plays a large role in other societal debates,

      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\ndebates,
      are different \"sides\" informed by different literatures,\nperhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a\ncommon evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead\nto a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open\navailability of scientific literature shape the
      role of science in\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific\nresults differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?\nHow
      do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\n\nIn addition to
      science, misinformation also plays a large role in\nsocietal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak of an\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\nfact-checkers, such
      as\n[maldita.es](https://maldita.es/){target=\"_blank\"} in Spain, or the\nlocal
      \"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\"\nhere at

      such as \"[Ask for\nEvidence](https://askforevidence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\"
      or \"[Stop,\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\"_blank\"}\",
      to help\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\nmisinformation?\n\n### Science and misinformation\n\nWe are excited to
      start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\nlead by [Riccardo\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We are\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\nInformation\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      New perspective\n\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\nbetween science and\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\"_blank\"},
      also in\nthe context of\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\"_blank\"}.\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and provides a\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to
      being\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\nscientific mentions are couched in
      and interact with other ways of\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      In\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\nand misinformation in societal debates.\n\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\nCWTS. Traditionally,
      our centre is more focused on science (and\ntechnology) studies. The UnMiSSeD
      project brings in not only\ncomputational social sciences but also media and
      communication studies\nand has clear connections to science communication. We
      hope to build out\nthese connections in the near future. Watch this blog for
      future updates\non our project. We are open to explore new opportunities, and

      past years have shown that science can play an important role in\nsocietal debates.
      Science was clearly pivotal in the development of\nCOVID-19 vaccines. In addition,
      many of the interventions and policies,\nsuch as masking, school closures or
      even curfews, were presented as\nevidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific
      advances in our\nunderstanding of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific\nfindings
      were part of broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal\nproponents and
      opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised\nsettings. Although very visible
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\nalso plays a large role in other societal
      debates, such as [the nitrogen\ndebate in the\nNetherlands](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180){target=\"_blank\"},\nor
      [climate\nchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs
      a part of our [Focal Area of Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      CWTS, we explore the role of science in societal debates. We know\nthat [science
      does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates or\nclear course of action
      for\npolic](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308){target=\"_blank\"}[y](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308).\nSome
      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\ndebates,
      are different \"sides\" informed by different literatures,\nperhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a\ncommon evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead\nto a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open\navailability of scientific literature shape the
      role of science in\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific\nresults differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?\nHow
      do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\n\nIn addition to
      science, misinformation also plays a large role in\nsocietal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak of an\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\nfact-checkers, such
      as\n[maldita.es](https://maldita.es/){target=\"_blank\"} in Spain, or the\nlocal
      \"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\"\nhere at
      Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness\nby the public,
      such as \"[Ask for\nEvidence](https://askforevidence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\"
      or \"[Stop,\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\"_blank\"}\",
      to help\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\nmisinformation?\n\n### Science and misinformation\n\nWe are excited to
      start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\nlead by [Riccardo\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We are\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\nInformation\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      New perspective\n\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\nbetween science and\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\"_blank\"},
      also in\nthe context of\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\"_blank\"}.\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and provides a\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to
      being\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\nscientific mentions are couched in
      and interact with other ways of\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      In\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\nand misinformation in societal debates.\n\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\nCWTS. Traditionally,
      our centre is more focused on science (and\ntechnology) studies. The UnMiSSeD
      project brings in not only\ncomputational social sciences but also media and
      communication studies\nand has clear connections to science communication. We
      hope to build out\nthese connections in the near future. Watch this blog for
      future updates\non our project. We are open to explore new opportunities, and
      if you\nwant to connect to us on this topic, please do [reach\nout](mailto:v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\"_blank\"}!  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Understanding-Misinformation-and-Science-in-Societal-Debates.png\"\ndata-image=\"38728\"

      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find\nmyself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey:\nthe CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\nConference on Science, Technology,
      and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the
      past two decades, this experience\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a
      journey that prompted me to\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.\n\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by conventional\nsurvey
      field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized the\nuntapped potential
      of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\nScience (LIS). My maiden
      bibliometric study delved into the\ncontroversial realm of the h-index, assessing
      its utility in gauging the\nscientific output of Peruvian researchers. The journey
      took a pivotal\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \"Measuring Science and Research\nPerformance\"\u00a0course
      at CWTS in Leiden, a week that unraveled the\nlimitations and detrimental consequences
      associated with relying on the\nh-index for critical decisions like research
      grants or promotions.\n\nWhy the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely
      contested journal\nimpact factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\nmisused
      bibliometric indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\nbibliometric studies,
      I couldn\\''t ignore the grim reality in many South\nAmerican countries---bibliometric
      reports often perpetuate the status\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\n\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\ntransparency and accessibility, often fell
      short. Discussions on\nalternative indicators typically revolve around metrics
      tied to\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While open-access\npublishing
      dominates the discourse on open science practices, few\nconsider the potential
      of data sharing and code transparency: for\nexample, sharing bibliographic datasets
      or the R/Stata codes essential\nfor transparent data analysis.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\"\nalt=\"Day
      2 vevrvolg 11\" />\n<figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023\nconference.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nEight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\nreturning
      to participate in the\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}. These\nevents were
      crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\n\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\necosystems. Through open dialogue and critical
      reflection, we began to\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that often underpin
      bibliometric\nanalysis. We acknowledged the distinct dynamics of scientific
      production\nin different regions and the varying priorities and challenges faced
      by\nresearchers in high-income and low-middle-income countries.\n\nThis newfound
      awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking the true\npotential of bibliometrics.
      By embracing diversity, incorporating\ncritical perspectives, and forging connections
      across borders, we can\ntransform this field from a passive observer into an
      active agent for\npositive change. We can use bibliometrics not to reinforce
      existing\ninequalities but to guide us toward a more inclusive and equitable\nscientific
      landscape, one where research serves the needs of all,\nregardless of their
      geographic location or economic standing.\n\nIn bidding farewell to the [Scientometrics
      Summer\nSchool](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [STI 2023\nConference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, I can\\''t
      help\nbut see it as not just an end but a promising new beginning. Armed with\nenriched
      perspectives, I embark on the next chapter of my bibliometric\njourney, eager
      to implement the lessons learned in contributing to a\nmore equitable and impactful
      scientific landscape.  \n\n[  \nHeader and in-text\u00a0image: Henri de Winter/CWTS]{.caption}\n",

      from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where I find\\nmyself reflecting
      on two transformative events in my scientific journey:\\nthe CWTS Scientometrics
      Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\\nConference on Science, Technology,
      and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\\nAs a bibliometrics enthusiast for the
      past two decades, this experience\\nhas been nothing short of a revelation---a
      journey that prompted me to\\nquestion the very fabric of scientific evaluation
      and metrics.\\n\\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by
      conventional\\nsurvey field research. Fast forward ten years, and I realized
      the\\nuntapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library and Information\\nScience
      (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the\\ncontroversial realm of
      the h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the\\nscientific output of Peruvian
      researchers. The journey took a pivotal\\nturn in 2015 when I attended the \\\"Measuring
      Science and Research\\nPerformance\\\"\_course at CWTS in Leiden, a week that
      unraveled the\\nlimitations and detrimental consequences associated with relying
      on the\\nh-index for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.\\n\\nWhy
      the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal\\nimpact
      factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\\nmisused bibliometric
      indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\\nbibliometric studies, I couldn\\\\'t
      ignore the grim reality in many South\\nAmerican countries---bibliometric reports
      often perpetuate the status\\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\\n\\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\\ntransparency and accessibility, often
      fell short. Discussions on\\nalternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to\\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access\\npublishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
      few\\nconsider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for\\nexample,

      and\nInnovation Indicators (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS\norganised in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science
      was\nnot only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe
      publication and peer review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate
      open\nscience activist and a driving force behind the experiment discussed in\nthis

      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate

      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate
      open\nscience activist and a driving force behind the experiment discussed in\nthis
      post.* [*He passed away in August\n2023,*](https://www.cwts.nl/news?article=n-s2z264){target=\"_blank\"}\n*while

      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\\nassumption that these values will support
      the evolution of an equitable\\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable
      science. Nonetheless,\\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\\nwith

      economic, industrial, and ecological\\nprocesses. This panel welcomes traditional
      presentations and artistic\\ncontributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken
      words), and invites\\ninterventions about the ocean as an object of study and
      an object of\\nconcern.  \\n\\nPanel number 299 aims to bring together studies

      panel invites contributions bringing an\\nSTS lens to the study of new quality
      notions, the reform movements that\\nsupport them and the evaluative situations
      where they count. We seek to\\ngenerate reflections of theoretical and practical
      significance for\\n(e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality

      "To develop our [CWTS knowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      formed [three focal\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\nthe vision
      and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\n\n### Our vision\n\nIn
      today\\''s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\nand inclusive
      science ecosystem that engages with society is of\nparamount importance. As
      we navigate complex global challenges such as\nclimate change, pandemics, and
      artificial intelligence, it becomes\nevident that diverse perspectives, inclusive
      participation and public\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication
      are key to\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal\nArea
      Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and promoting diversity\nand inclusivity
      in the science ecosystem and the engagement and\ncommunication between science
      and society.*\n\nIn line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda
      --\n*understanding*, *intervening* and *practising* -- we developed an\nambitious
      agenda for the study and promotion of diversity, inclusion,\nengagement, communication
      and science-society interactions. Our work\nwill not only contribute to research
      and teaching around these\nquestions, but will also support policy developments
      and interventions,\nand generate insights into how we can implement our findings
      at our own\ncentre.\n\n### Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\n\nWe
      believe diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\nimportant.
      By breaking down barriers to participation in science for\nindividuals from
      a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\nenrich the pool of
      knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which,\nin turn, helps to address
      scientific and societal challenges more\neffectively. Who gets to participate
      in science is not always\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding
      and\nwell-considered interventions to improve the inclusion and\nrepresentation
      of all social groups in science, and the science system\nas a whole.\n\n###
      Epistemic Diversity\n\nEpistemic diversity in the science system is of major
      importance. We\nneed to recognise how different topics, research questions,
      knowledge\nsystems, and actors, including\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\"_blank\"}\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\nglobal issues.
      By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\nexpect to foster a more
      inclusive and innovative environment where\ndifferent ways of knowing are valued
      and incorporated.\n\nFor instance, we want to study and address the lack of\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\n\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\n\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\nintegral building blocks for a stronger
      and more relevant research and\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science communication
      and public\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia and society;
      help to\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible to the wider\npublic
      and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry, etc.);\nlimit the impact
      of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\ninformation; and may help to
      increase public trust in science. We will\nstudy how society engages with science,
      in order to improve science\ncommunication and strengthen the role science can
      play in society.\n\n[Citizen\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\n\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\n\n####   {#section dir=\"ltr\"}\n\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion
      is all\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise, projects,\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\n\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\"_blank\"})
      and [institute\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      the work of the [Citizen Science\nLab](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [UNESCO\nlab](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n(Figure
      1). This mapping formed an excellent means for thinking about\nour future activities.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/board_fullsize.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"1ppykiiy08s7\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Mapping of our current projects and activities to\nthe
      three sub-areas (initially labelled as <em>ambitions</em>) - Miro\nboard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n####
      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nWe have created a working group for
      each of the three sub-areas to\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and outside
      of CWTS, each\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex\nchallenges
      of the sub-areas.\n\nProjects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day work at
      CWTS. Our Focal\nArea will help coordinate existing projects, and monitor funding\nopportunities
      to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning\nprojects with the
      goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving\nour vision and ambitions.\n\nIn
      addition, engagement and communication activities will be of central\nimportance
      for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \"[Researching\n(in-) equity,
      diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\nmixed- and multi-method\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\"_blank\"}s\"\norganised

      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion is all\\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise,
      projects,\\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})
      and [institute\\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and
      outside of CWTS, each\\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing
      projects, and monitor funding\\nopportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
      strategy of aligning\\nprojects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
      for achieving\\nour vision and ambitions.\\n\\nIn addition, engagement and communication
      activities will be of central\\nimportance for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \\\"[Researching\\n(in-)

      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####

      Access is a movement and policy directive dedicated to reforming\nthe closed
      or subscription-based gatekeeping of scientific research. In\nthe subscription-based\u00a0(when
      readers pay) model scientists communicate\nthe results of their research, by
      submitting it to publishers, and in\nmany cases to one of a small number of
      large commercial publishers,\nconsidered to be [an\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\"_blank\"}.\nPublishers
      \\''process\\'' this work, then provide academic institutions\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\''opportunity\\'' to buy back research via\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\n\nDr. Eugene Garfield is
      a renowned figure in certain scientific\ncommunities for having founded the
      [Institute for Scientific Information\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\nfirst *Science
      Citation\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\nworldwide. Today, this index has been
      expanded commercially to include\nadditional products, which are now part of
      Clarivate\\''s trademarked *Web\nof Science\u2122*.\n\nDr. Garfield\\''s vision
      was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\ndevelop a tool to assist university/college
      libraries with their journal\nselection needs: a one-time legitimate process
      that had already been on\nthe minds of other scientists. [Gross and Gross\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\"_blank\"}
      are\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\"*What files of\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\nstudent for advanced
      work\\... ?*\\\". The answer was to \\\"*compile a\njournal list\"* considered
      to be \\\"*indispensable*\\\", and to base this\nlist on an *\\\"arbitrary standard
      of some kind by which to determine the\ndesirability of purchasing a particular
      journal\\\"* (p. 1713). That\narbitrary standard was to focus on their citedness.
      Years later,\n[Brodman\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\''s\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\"_blank\"})\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\"_blank\"}
      took up\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\nAlthough Garfield
      both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\nJIF when evaluating individuals,
      he is ''blissfully'' unaware of the scale\nof problems resulting from the [use
      of the Journal Impact\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\"_blank\"}.\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\ncall\n\\''[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\"_blank\"}\\''.\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\''Open\nAccess\\'',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\npublishing.\n\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\n\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\"_blank\"})\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\nrecognized how difficult it was to process,
      print, collect subscription\nfees and manage society publications without accruing
      financial losses.\nCommercial publishing grew at one time from a legitimate
      and realistic\nneed. Editors required the support, and were for the most part,
      relieved\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific publishing was
      not\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses were\nfounded,
      and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\ngrow at an
      [exponential\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\"_blank\"}\namounting
      to more than\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\"_blank\"},\nthough
      according to [recent\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\"_blank\"},\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\n\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\n\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\n\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\ntowards
      a ''flipped'' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models, but
      we cannot\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Some\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which allows them to\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\nhighly-ranked\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\"_blank\"}.\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\"_blank\"}\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\n[strong age\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\"_blank\"}.
      And,\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal''s\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for ''thoroughness'' and ''helpfulness'' of\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0\n\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \n\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\n\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\n\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\"_blank\"}.\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\nthat we need is fewer
      reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\nsituations where certain researchers
      have little choice but to publish\nin one of the commercially indexed, paywalled
      journals.\n\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that we focus
      *solely*\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it not time to
      exit\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway again, towards\na
      radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\n\n### Socio-Technical
      Innovation\n\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift in perceptions and
      behaviour\npatterns within our global scientific community implies that [innovation\nstarts
      with some sort of ''symbolic\nstrategy''](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\"_blank\"}.\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\nin evaluation
      systems.\n\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He took
      us\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\nBerners-Lee''s
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\nof scientific\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\"_blank\"}!\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\n\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\nif not its editor-in-chief, editorial
      board, and thousands of volunteer\nacademics worldwide who peer review submitted
      manuscripts? Many, if not\nmost scholars believe in preserving the journal,
      and we will likely find\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals perform
      a constituent and\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific fields
      and\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions, we\nmight
      rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\"_blank\"}).\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if ''by any other name'' the\nrose would
      ''smell as sweet!'' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\nany future
      needs.\n\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\"_blank\"}\nor
      [scholarly digital\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\"_blank\"}).\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\n\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\" and renounce the titled journal\ncalled \"*Quantitative Studies of Quantitativeness*\",
      our international\ncommunity would then think about putting an article up for
      review at the\n\"A Topic-Editorial Team\" or the \"B Topic-Editorial Team\".\n\nWhatever
      solution we choose, it starts with abandoning journal titles\nand rank then
      shifting to an innovative international\nsocio-technological platform, based
      on key journal functions. The result\nwould still be accessible research, still
      peer reviewed, and valued\naccording to what should be valued: editorial teams
      and engaged peer\nreview.\n\nThis solution may be realised in many different
      shapes or forms, and may\nnot necessarily solve all problems. We are not aiming
      to be strictly\nprescriptive here. However, it would put the scholarly record
      keeping\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the hands of commercial\nownership,
      though any kind of solution can include some commercial\nservice providers (e.g.,
      technical expertise, administrative support;\nstyle-setting/XML). It would also
      enable us to give more attention to\nother issues, like [challenges associated
      with peer\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\"_blank\"}.\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\nthrough technological innovation.\n\n  \n\n[[Header

      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\\nworldwide. Today, this index has

      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\\\'s\\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      took up\\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\\nAlthough
      Garfield both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\\nJIF when evaluating
      individuals, he is 'blissfully' unaware of the scale\\nof problems resulting
      from the [use of the Journal Impact\\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\\ncall\\n\\\\'[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'.\\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\\\'Open\\nAccess\\\\',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\\npublishing.\\n\\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\\n\\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\\nrecognized how difficult it was to
      process, print, collect subscription\\nfees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses.\\nCommercial publishing grew at one time
      from a legitimate and realistic\\nneed. Editors required the support, and were
      for the most part, relieved\\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific
      publishing was not\\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses
      were\\nfounded, and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\\ngrow
      at an [exponential\\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\namounting
      to more than\\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthough
      according to [recent\\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\\n\\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\\n\\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\\n\\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\\ntowards
      a 'flipped' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models,
      but we cannot\\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Some\\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which allows them to\\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\\nhighly-ranked\\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\\n[strong age\\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      And,\\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal's\\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for 'thoroughness' and 'helpfulness' of\\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_\\n\\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\\n\\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\\nthat we need is
      fewer reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\\nsituations where certain
      researchers have little choice but to publish\\nin one of the commercially indexed,
      paywalled journals.\\n\\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that
      we focus *solely*\\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it
      not time to exit\\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
      again, towards\\na radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\\n\\n###
      Socio-Technical Innovation\\n\\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift
      in perceptions and behaviour\\npatterns within our global scientific community
      implies that [innovation\\nstarts with some sort of 'symbolic\\nstrategy'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\\nin evaluation
      systems.\\n\\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He
      took us\\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\\nBerners-Lee's
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\\nof scientific\\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\\n\\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\\nif not its editor-in-chief,
      editorial board, and thousands of volunteer\\nacademics worldwide who peer review
      submitted manuscripts? Many, if not\\nmost scholars believe in preserving the
      journal, and we will likely find\\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals
      perform a constituent and\\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific
      fields and\\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions,
      we\\nmight rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\\\'s\\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      took up\\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\\nAlthough
      Garfield both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\\nJIF when evaluating
      individuals, he is 'blissfully' unaware of the scale\\nof problems resulting
      from the [use of the Journal Impact\\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\\ncall\\n\\\\'[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'.\\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\\\'Open\\nAccess\\\\',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\\npublishing.\\n\\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\\n\\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\\nrecognized how difficult it was to
      process, print, collect subscription\\nfees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses.\\nCommercial publishing grew at one time
      from a legitimate and realistic\\nneed. Editors required the support, and were
      for the most part, relieved\\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific
      publishing was not\\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses
      were\\nfounded, and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\\ngrow
      at an [exponential\\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\namounting
      to more than\\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthough
      according to [recent\\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\\n\\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\\n\\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\\n\\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\\ntowards
      a 'flipped' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models,
      but we cannot\\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Some\\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which allows them to\\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\\nhighly-ranked\\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\\n[strong age\\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      And,\\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal's\\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for 'thoroughness' and 'helpfulness' of\\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_\\n\\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\\n\\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\\nthat we need is
      fewer reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\\nsituations where certain
      researchers have little choice but to publish\\nin one of the commercially indexed,
      paywalled journals.\\n\\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that
      we focus *solely*\\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it
      not time to exit\\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
      again, towards\\na radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\\n\\n###
      Socio-Technical Innovation\\n\\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift
      in perceptions and behaviour\\npatterns within our global scientific community
      implies that [innovation\\nstarts with some sort of 'symbolic\\nstrategy'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\\nin evaluation
      systems.\\n\\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He
      took us\\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\\nBerners-Lee's
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\\nof scientific\\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\\n\\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\\nif not its editor-in-chief,
      editorial board, and thousands of volunteer\\nacademics worldwide who peer review
      submitted manuscripts? Many, if not\\nmost scholars believe in preserving the
      journal, and we will likely find\\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals
      perform a constituent and\\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific
      fields and\\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions,
      we\\nmight rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      "Leiden Madtrics", "blog_slug": "leidenmadtrics", "content_text": "CWTS is an
      interdisciplinary institute at Leiden University with a\ndiverse multinational
      academic culture. PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers, and visiting scholars
      from around the world gather at CWTS\nto pursue their research journeys. The
      journey can be an inspiring yet\nchallenging experience. It might be filled
      with research, innovation,\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey
      that feels isolating\nat times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers
      need to\nspend extended periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\ndetachment
      from the broader social and academic community. Loneliness\ncan be particularly
      challenging for our PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers and visiting researchers
      who have transitioned to a new,\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and
      to create a dynamic and\nsupportive community, in September, we have started
      an Early Career\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian
      Xie as the\nChair and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\n\n###
      What does it mean to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\n\nThere
      is more to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\nassumes full
      involvement in the research process, from generating ideas\nto implementing
      them practically. The research process includes not only\nconducting research
      but also actively participating in academic events\nsuch as seminars, conferences,
      symposia, and round tables. Here, PhD\ncandidates can exchange experiences with
      peers, discuss their ideas, and\nbecome familiar with new methods and approaches
      in their field of\nknowledge.\n\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails constant
      self-development and\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously update
      one\\''s knowledge,\nmonitor new trends and discoveries in their field. Ultimately,
      all of\nthis contributes to the development of the PhD candidates'' professional\nskills,
      their readiness for independent research activities, and\nsuccessful careers.\n\nTo
      some extent, the same holds true for early career researchers -- not\nonly the
      PhD candidates. Early career researchers are people taking\ntheir first steps
      in a academic career. They have a fresh and critical\nview of the world, full
      of energy and desire to contribute to the\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS,
      quite a few colleagues are doing\nresearch without following a PhD trajectory.
      We realized that we need to\ninclude them as well, since some of their struggles
      are the same.\n\nTo provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we
      established\nthe ECR/PhD Council.\n\n### What is the ECR/PhD Council?\n\nThe
      ECR/PhD Council is a small, dedicated body (currently consisting of\ntwo members)
      within CWTS that brings together PhDs and early career\nresearchers. The Council
      is committed to the promotion of internal\ncommunication, coordination of supportive
      and networking activities, and\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community.
      At the same time, the\nCouncil is the formal connection between the ECRs and
      PhDs and the CWTS\nPhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.\n\n### What
      are we planning to do?\n\n- Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD
      can often feel\n  like a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\n  community
      where individuals can connect, share experiences, and\n  provide emotional support
      to one another. The Council members also\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic
      related meetings and informal\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the
      well-being and social\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits.
      For instance,\n  introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\n  pub-quizzes.\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\n  English to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD
      candidates may\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results, papers,\n  posters).
      We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\n  farewell meetings
      for early career researchers, providing them with\n  the opportunity to present
      the research they have conducted during\n  their time at CWTS. Of course, this
      event is not mandatory but highly\n  encouraged.\n- Buddy system: New CWTS PhD
      candidates are now offered the opportunity\n  to be paired with a senior CWTS
      PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\n  candidate). External PhD candidates
      will also benefit from this\n  system.\n- Providing insights to the CWTS Management
      Board.\n\n### What has happened so far?\n\nOur experience of joining the ECR/PhD
      Council has been great so far!\nIt''s not just about attending meetings and
      organizing events. It''s all\nabout being part of a supportive and dynamic academic
      community. Here''s\nwhat the experience has been like:\n\n- Community Building:
      We''ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow\n  PhD students and early
      career researcher from various fields, which\n  has broadened our perspective.\n-
      Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered by\n  the
      council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our\n  knowledge
      base.\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice our needs\n  and
      concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It''s\n  empowering
      to know that our interests are being represented.\n- Collaboration and Leadership:
      We''ve already been encouraged to take on\n  leadership roles within the council,
      which we hope will allow us to\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\n\nOn
      October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\nat which
      the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc had a chance to\nintroduce their research.
      The chairman of the Council also introduced\nall issues relevant to do a PhD
      at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses,
      etc.). Even though the\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"\nalt=\"Welcoming
      event photo\" />\n<figcaption>First welcoming event organised by the ECR/PhD\nCouncil.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter
      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\nwas not only a fascinating
      cultural experience but also an excellent way\nto strengthen relationships.  \n\nIf
      you would like to share your experience on how PhD activities are\norganized
      in your institution or if you have any questions, you can\nreach us via ecrphd@cwts.leidenuniv.nl!\n\n  \n\n[Header

      is an interdisciplinary institute at Leiden University with a\ndiverse multinational
      academic culture. PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers, and visiting scholars
      from around the world gather at CWTS\nto pursue their research journeys. The
      journey can be an inspiring yet\nchallenging experience. It might be filled
      with research, innovation,\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey
      that feels isolating\nat times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers
      need to\nspend extended periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\ndetachment
      from the broader social and academic community. Loneliness\ncan be particularly
      challenging for our PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers and visiting researchers
      who have transitioned to a new,\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and
      to create a dynamic and\nsupportive community, in September, we have started
      an Early Career\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian
      Xie as the\nChair and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\n\n###
      What does it mean to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\n\nThere
      is more to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\nassumes full
      involvement in the research process, from generating ideas\nto implementing
      them practically. The research process includes not only\nconducting research
      but also actively participating in academic events\nsuch as seminars, conferences,
      symposia, and round tables. Here, PhD\ncandidates can exchange experiences with
      peers, discuss their ideas, and\nbecome familiar with new methods and approaches
      in their field of\nknowledge.\n\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails constant
      self-development and\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously update
      one\\''s knowledge,\nmonitor new trends and discoveries in their field. Ultimately,
      all of\nthis contributes to the development of the PhD candidates'' professional\nskills,
      their readiness for independent research activities, and\nsuccessful careers.\n\nTo
      some extent, the same holds true for early career researchers -- not\nonly the
      PhD candidates. Early career researchers are people taking\ntheir first steps
      in a academic career. They have a fresh and critical\nview of the world, full
      of energy and desire to contribute to the\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS,
      quite a few colleagues are doing\nresearch without following a PhD trajectory.
      We realized that we need to\ninclude them as well, since some of their struggles
      are the same.\n\nTo provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we
      established\nthe ECR/PhD Council.\n\n### What is the ECR/PhD Council?\n\nThe
      ECR/PhD Council is a small, dedicated body (currently consisting of\ntwo members)
      within CWTS that brings together PhDs and early career\nresearchers. The Council
      is committed to the promotion of internal\ncommunication, coordination of supportive
      and networking activities, and\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community.
      At the same time, the\nCouncil is the formal connection between the ECRs and
      PhDs and the CWTS\nPhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.\n\n### What
      are we planning to do?\n\n- Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD
      can often feel\n  like a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\n  community
      where individuals can connect, share experiences, and\n  provide emotional support
      to one another. The Council members also\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic
      related meetings and informal\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the
      well-being and social\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits.
      For instance,\n  introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\n  pub-quizzes.\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\n  English to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD
      candidates may\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results, papers,\n  posters).
      We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\n  farewell meetings
      for early career researchers, providing them with\n  the opportunity to present
      the research they have conducted during\n  their time at CWTS. Of course, this
      event is not mandatory but highly\n  encouraged.\n- Buddy system: New CWTS PhD
      candidates are now offered the opportunity\n  to be paired with a senior CWTS
      PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\n  candidate). External PhD candidates
      will also benefit from this\n  system.\n- Providing insights to the CWTS Management
      Board.\n\n### What has happened so far?\n\nOur experience of joining the ECR/PhD
      Council has been great so far!\nIt''s not just about attending meetings and
      organizing events. It''s all\nabout being part of a supportive and dynamic academic
      community. Here''s\nwhat the experience has been like:\n\n- Community Building:
      We''ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow\n  PhD students and early
      career researcher from various fields, which\n  has broadened our perspective.\n-
      Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered by\n  the
      council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our\n  knowledge
      base.\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice our needs\n  and
      concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It''s\n  empowering
      to know that our interests are being represented.\n- Collaboration and Leadership:
      We''ve already been encouraged to take on\n  leadership roles within the council,
      which we hope will allow us to\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\n\nOn
      October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\nat which
      the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc had a chance to\nintroduce their research.
      The chairman of the Council also introduced\nall issues relevant to do a PhD
      at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses,
      etc.). Even though the\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"\nalt=\"Welcoming
      event photo\" />\n<figcaption>First welcoming event organised by the ECR/PhD\nCouncil.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter
      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\nwas not only a fascinating
      cultural experience but also an excellent way\nto strengthen relationships.  \n\nIf
      you would like to share your experience on how PhD activities are\norganized
      in your institution or if you have any questions, you can\nreach us via ecrphd@cwts.leidenuniv.nl!\n\n  \n\n[Header

      and professor in Museological\nAspects of the Natural Sciences at the Centre
      for the Arts in Society of\nLeiden University, for inviting me to give a comment
      on the second day\nof the symposium. This blog post is an adaptation of the
      talk I gave\nthere.\n\n*Does science need heroes?* Spoken like a proper academic,
      my answer to\nthis question would be: yes and no.\n\nLet me start with the latter.\n\nNo,
      the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What it does\nneed is
      structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\nvarious forms
      of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\nrigor, excessive competition,
      commercialization, and vanity publishing.\nIt is unhealthy for researchers to
      want to be a hero in the current\nsystem.\n\nBut also: yes! Science is in dire
      need of heroes! Because the science\nsystem needs to reform, we need different
      types of people who can lead\nthe way and set an example with good leadership.
      This is what I want to\naddress in this commentary.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img

      Boerhaave\\''s wonderful collection, I\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\n\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\n\\''eminence\\'', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\nbetween Cattell\\''s work on \\''eminence\\''
      as the primary \\''virtue\\'' of\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\n\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\''eminence\\'' or greatness,\nobserved a decrease in the number
      of \\''great men\\'' compared to earlier\nperiods, which they found concerning.
      They feared the biological\ndegeneration of the population, and this fear was
      exacerbated by a more\ngeneral concern about the decline of the British Empire.
      This fear was\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization, democratization,\nand
      a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\''great men\\'' was\nalso
      reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist in a\ntime when
      scientific work increasingly became a \\''profession\\'' among\nother professions.
      The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\ntools to classify \\''eminence\\''
      in a new way. His idea was that\nprofessors could be placed on a single ranked
      list based on peer review.\nHe asked a large number of scientists to create
      a list, ranking\nscientists from the most to the least prominent, based on a
      selection of\nnames provided in advance. High \\\"output\\\" was insufficient
      as an\nindicator of \\''eminence\\''; it was primarily about reputation among\npeers.
      What exactly this reputation was based on remained ambiguous.\nCattell kept
      various background and biographical information about the\nmen on the lists,
      including data on birthplace, residence, age, and\nespecially the university
      where researchers had received their\neducation. But his lists also quickly
      started to serve other purposes:\nhe mapped how \\''scientific eminence\\''
      was distributed across cities and\nuniversities. And I quote from a piece in
      1903: \\\"We can tell whether\nthe average scientific standard in one part of
      the country or at a\ncertain university is higher or lower than elsewhere; we
      can also\nquantitatively map the scientific strength of a university or\ndepartment.\\\"
      So, initially, Cattell\\''s lists were not compiled with the\npurpose of comparing
      institutions, but the information these instruments\nprovided was indeed used
      for these comparisons.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/tblCattell.png\"\ndata-image=\"36480\"

      study of scientific men and his subsequent ranking of\nuniversities was deeply
      rooted in a larger debate about the role of the\nscientist. The ideal image
      of a researcher was evolving significantly at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning
      of the 20th century, as I think is\nhappening again today. But back then, older
      ideas about the\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\n\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\ninstruments have in the past decades started to
      shape our perception of\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback loop
      between policy on\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on the other.
      An\nexcellent researcher''s standing is now primarily determined by their\nresearch
      production. This is partly still science as a profession that\nCattell and others
      instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\nkey performance indicators
      (like a lot of other professions in\nneoliberal democratic societies). The primary
      tactical and strategic\naims have become competing for (ever decreasing amounts
      of) research\nincome, and publishing in prestigious journals, and aiming for
      a Nobel\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards have become important parts\nof
      academic CVs. And because of gender and other diversity gaps, this\nmakes it
      harder for women and other minority groups to make a career in\nscience. University
      rankings use prizes and awards as input, and this\ntrickles down in university
      policies. Universities over the past decades\nhave started to think in terms
      of globalised economic markets for\nexcellent researchers.\n\nThe motivation
      behind policies for excellence perhaps at one point made\nsense, and Dutch science
      is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\nand this is not often acknowledged,
      there is a big structural issue with\nthe way we measure excellence. If we are
      truly honest: current notions\nof excellence and metrics-driven assessment criteria
      are threatening to\nshape the content of the work and the diversity of the subject
      matter.\nWe are observing that research is designed and adjusted in a way that\nensures
      a good score. We see that people are choosing research questions\nnot just based
      on interest or importance, but also to improve their\nchances of getting a job.
      This [''thinking with\nindicators''](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\nare not
      being addressed and even become ''unthinkable''.\n\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\nfor what you could call ''social''
      elements. Think of decreasing\ncollegiality, less commitment to the community,
      or bad leadership. And\nif we\\''re mostly noticing and applauding the \\''big
      names,\\'' those\nveteran academics with a significant reputation, we are hurting
      the\nopportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who play\ncrucial
      roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is so\nhigh that
      ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday\nbecause otherwise
      their work will be ''scooped''. Competitiveness can\ncreate feelings of constant
      failure among early career researchers, as\nthey may never feel they meet the
      required standards. And even those who\nare at the top, and we have interviewed
      many, often feel they must\ncontinue to work ever harder to keep out-competing
      others. Group leaders\nand heads of department warn each other about the health
      risks that they\nrun by chronically working very hard, year after year. This
      is an actual\nquote from an actual interview:  \n\nThe example these senior
      researchers are setting with that behaviour to\ntheir younger colleagues is
      that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\nweek, and that if people can''t keep
      up, they are not fit for the\nChampions League. These senior researchers have
      really internalised that\nthis is what it takes to play the game, and that if
      you can''t stand the\nheat, you should get out of the kitchen. But let''s face
      it, that kitchen\nis on fire.\n\nFor one, we have globally had several severe
      integrity and\nreproducibility crises. We have seen the shadow side of competition,\nwhere
      researchers focus too much on finding new things and trying to do\nthat quickly,
      even if that means that they might not be doing\nhigh-quality research. Of course,
      we all want to tell our students to\ndream big and ideally, we also provide
      them with the protected space to\ndevelop their own research and strive for
      the highest quality. However,\nif in the meantime we also encourage them to
      focus on chasing after\ngroundbreaking results and judge success mainly by how
      many times our\nwork gets cited by others, we create a culture where short-termism
      and\nrisk aversion thrive. This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\nsecure
      funding in competitive four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\nvery hard
      for researchers to do long-term, risky projects, or work in\nfields that have
      a big impact on society but don\\''t get cited as much,\nlike applied sciences
      or social sciences. As a result, research agendas\ndon\\''t always focus on
      what society really needs. Also, all this\ncompetition can make scientists less
      likely to collaborate, which is\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\n\nTo
      make science better, we need to change our priorities, and support a\nwider
      range of research. We very urgently need more diverse perspectives\nand inclusive
      participation in science. [We need to collaborate and open\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\"_blank\"}\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\nreally need to rethink the
      criteria for excellent research. These\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
      because research evaluation has the\npower to affect the culture of research;
      individual career trajectories\nand researchers'' well-being; the quality of
      evidence informing policy\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in research
      and research\nfunding.\n\nI would also like to address a misunderstanding about
      the Dutch\n[''recognition and rewards''\nprogram](https://recognitionrewards.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      I often hear\na concern that the program wants to wishy-washily include everyone
      and\nforgets about upholding excellence. I do not think that this is a fair\nportrayal
      of the program. At its core, the program is about an honest\nlook in the mirror,
      and about fixing what is broken. The program is part\nof a much larger set of
      national, regional, and global initiatives\nincluding the [DORA Declaration](https://sfdora.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand

      these initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think\nevaluation. And we
      need other types of leaders and heroes in academia,\nwho will work together
      to implement responsible forms of research\nassessment. We should stop sending
      each other the message that\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is always
      more we need to do\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful, we need
      to invest more\nin building strong academic communities that value collaboration
      and\nshare a commitment to advancing research and teaching, while making a\npositive
      impact on and with society.\n\nOne of my heroes in life is Pippi Langstr\u00f6m,
      or Pippie Langkous in\nDutch. I used to watch her show when I was little. Pippi
      has this\nsaying: \"I have never tried this before, so I think I should definitely\nbe
      able to do that.\" I love it. And I believe that we need to reward\nthis type
      of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We\nshould foster
      taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our\ncomfort zone, and being
      bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously.\nBut in fact, we see the opposite
      happen among early career researchers.\nMany of them suffer from [anxiety and

      it does\\nneed is structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\\nvarious
      forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\\nrigor, excessive
      competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.\\nIt is unhealthy for
      researchers to want to be a hero in the current\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut also: yes!
      Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science\\nsystem needs to reform,
      we need different types of people who can lead\\nthe way and set an example
      with good leadership. This is what I want to\\naddress in this commentary.\\n\\n<figure

      Boerhaave\\\\'s wonderful collection, I\\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\\n\\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\\n\\\\'eminence\\\\', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\\nbetween Cattell\\\\'s work on \\\\'eminence\\\\'
      as the primary \\\\'virtue\\\\' of\\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\\n\\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\\\'eminence\\\\' or greatness,\\nobserved a decrease in the
      number of \\\\'great men\\\\' compared to earlier\\nperiods, which they found
      concerning. They feared the biological\\ndegeneration of the population, and
      this fear was exacerbated by a more\\ngeneral concern about the decline of the
      British Empire. This fear was\\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization,
      democratization,\\nand a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\\\'great
      men\\\\' was\\nalso reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist
      in a\\ntime when scientific work increasingly became a \\\\'profession\\\\'
      among\\nother professions. The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\\ntools
      to classify \\\\'eminence\\\\' in a new way. His idea was that\\nprofessors
      could be placed on a single ranked list based on peer review.\\nHe asked a large
      number of scientists to create a list, ranking\\nscientists from the most to
      the least prominent, based on a selection of\\nnames provided in advance. High
      \\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\" was insufficient as an\\nindicator of \\\\'eminence\\\\';
      it was primarily about reputation among\\npeers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous.\\nCattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the\\nmen on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and\\nespecially the university where researchers had received their\\neducation.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes:\\nhe mapped how
      \\\\'scientific eminence\\\\' was distributed across cities and\\nuniversities.
      And I quote from a piece in 1903: \\\\\\\"We can tell whether\\nthe average

      being addressed and even become 'unthinkable'.\\n\\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\\nfor what you could call 'social'

      otherwise their work will be 'scooped'. Competitiveness can\\ncreate feelings
      of constant failure among early career researchers, as\\nthey may never feel
      they meet the required standards. And even those who\\nare at the top, and we
      have interviewed many, often feel they must\\ncontinue to work ever harder to
      keep out-competing others. Group leaders\\nand heads of department warn each
      other about the health risks that they\\nrun by chronically working very hard,
      year after year. This is an actual\\nquote from an actual interview:  \\n\\nThe
      example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour to\\ntheir
      younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\\nweek, and that
      if people can't keep up, they are not fit for the\\nChampions League. These
      senior researchers have really internalised that\\nthis is what it takes to
      play the game, and that if you can't stand the\\nheat, you should get out of
      the kitchen. But let's face it, that kitchen\\nis on fire.\\n\\nFor one, we
      have globally had several severe integrity and\\nreproducibility crises. We
      have seen the shadow side of competition,\\nwhere researchers focus too much
      on finding new things and trying to do\\nthat quickly, even if that means that
      they might not be doing\\nhigh-quality research. Of course, we all want to tell
      our students to\\ndream big and ideally, we also provide them with the protected
      space to\\ndevelop their own research and strive for the highest quality. However,\\nif
      in the meantime we also encourage them to focus on chasing after\\ngroundbreaking
      results and judge success mainly by how many times our\\nwork gets cited by
      others, we create a culture where short-termism and\\nrisk aversion thrive.
      This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\\nsecure funding in competitive
      four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\\nvery hard for researchers to do
      long-term, risky projects, or work in\\nfields that have a big impact on society
      but don\\\\'t get cited as much,\\nlike applied sciences or social sciences.
      As a result, research agendas\\ndon\\\\'t always focus on what society really
      needs. Also, all this\\ncompetition can make scientists less likely to collaborate,
      which is\\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\\n\\nTo make science better,
      we need to change our priorities, and support a\\nwider range of research. We
      very urgently need more diverse perspectives\\nand inclusive participation in
      science. [We need to collaborate and open\\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\\nreally need to rethink
      the criteria for excellent research. These\\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,

      individual career trajectories\\nand researchers' well-being; the quality of

      I often hear\\na concern that the program wants to wishy-washily include everyone

      of the program. At its core, the program is about an honest\\nlook in the mirror,
      and about fixing what is broken. The program is part\\nof a much larger set

      each other the message that\\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is always
      more we need to do\\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful, we need
      to invest more\\nin building strong academic communities that value collaboration

      type of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We\\nshould
      foster taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our\\ncomfort zone,
      and being bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously.\\nBut in fact, we

      my answer to\\nthis question would be: yes and no.\\n\\nLet me start with the
      latter.\\n\\nNo, the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What
      it does\\nneed is structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\\nvarious
      forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\\nrigor, excessive
      competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.\\nIt is unhealthy for
      researchers to want to be a hero in the current\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut also: yes!
      Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science\\nsystem needs to reform,
      we need different types of people who can lead\\nthe way and set an example
      with good leadership. This is what I want to\\naddress in this commentary.\\n\\n<figure

      Commons</a></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nBut first, and inspired by Museum
      Boerhaave\\\\'s wonderful collection, I\\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\\n\\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\\n\\\\'eminence\\\\', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\\nbetween Cattell\\\\'s work on \\\\'eminence\\\\'
      as the primary \\\\'virtue\\\\' of\\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\\n\\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\\\'eminence\\\\' or greatness,\\nobserved a decrease in the
      number of \\\\'great men\\\\' compared to earlier\\nperiods, which they found
      concerning. They feared the biological\\ndegeneration of the population, and
      this fear was exacerbated by a more\\ngeneral concern about the decline of the
      British Empire. This fear was\\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization,
      democratization,\\nand a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\\\'great
      men\\\\' was\\nalso reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist
      in a\\ntime when scientific work increasingly became a \\\\'profession\\\\'
      among\\nother professions. The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\\ntools
      to classify \\\\'eminence\\\\' in a new way. His idea was that\\nprofessors
      could be placed on a single ranked list based on peer review.\\nHe asked a large
      number of scientists to create a list, ranking\\nscientists from the most to
      the least prominent, based on a selection of\\nnames provided in advance. High
      \\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\" was insufficient as an\\nindicator of \\\\'eminence\\\\';
      it was primarily about reputation among\\npeers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous.\\nCattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the\\nmen on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and\\nespecially the university where researchers had received their\\neducation.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes:\\nhe mapped how
      \\\\'scientific eminence\\\\' was distributed across cities and\\nuniversities.
      And I quote from a piece in 1903: \\\\\\\"We can tell whether\\nthe average
      scientific standard in one part of the country or at a\\ncertain university
      is higher or lower than elsewhere; we can also\\nquantitatively map the scientific
      strength of a university or\\ndepartment.\\\\\\\" So, initially, Cattell\\\\'s
      lists were not compiled with the\\npurpose of comparing institutions, but the
      information these instruments\\nprovided was indeed used for these comparisons.\\n\\n<figure

      />\\n<figcaption>Table from <a href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1627220\\\"\\ntarget=\\\"_blank\\\">Cattell,
      1898</a>: Doctorates in Philosophy from\\nAmerican universities in a single
      year</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nCattell\\\\'s study of scientific
      men and his subsequent ranking of\\nuniversities was deeply rooted in a larger
      debate about the role of the\\nscientist. The ideal image of a researcher was
      evolving significantly at\\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
      century, as I think is\\nhappening again today. But back then, older ideas about
      the\\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\\n\\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\\ninstruments have in the past decades started
      to shape our perception of\\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback
      loop between policy on\\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on
      the other. An\\nexcellent researcher's standing is now primarily determined
      by their\\nresearch production. This is partly still science as a profession
      that\\nCattell and others instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\\nkey
      performance indicators (like a lot of other professions in\\nneoliberal democratic
      societies). The primary tactical and strategic\\naims have become competing
      for (ever decreasing amounts of) research\\nincome, and publishing in prestigious
      journals, and aiming for a Nobel\\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards
      have become important parts\\nof academic CVs. And because of gender and other
      diversity gaps, this\\nmakes it harder for women and other minority groups to
      make a career in\\nscience. University rankings use prizes and awards as input,
      and this\\ntrickles down in university policies. Universities over the past
      decades\\nhave started to think in terms of globalised economic markets for\\nexcellent
      researchers.\\n\\nThe motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one
      point made\\nsense, and Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\\nand
      this is not often acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with\\nthe way
      we measure excellence. If we are truly honest: current notions\\nof excellence
      and metrics-driven assessment criteria are threatening to\\nshape the content
      of the work and the diversity of the subject matter.\\nWe are observing that
      research is designed and adjusted in a way that\\nensures a good score. We see
      that people are choosing research questions\\nnot just based on interest or
      importance, but also to improve their\\nchances of getting a job. This ['thinking
      with\\nindicators'](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\\nare not

      these initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think\\nevaluation. And
      we need other types of leaders and heroes in academia,\\nwho will work together
      to implement responsible forms of research\\nassessment. We should stop sending
      each other the message that\\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is always
      more we need to do\\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful, we need
      to invest more\\nin building strong academic communities that value collaboration
      and\\nshare a commitment to advancing research and teaching, while making a\\npositive
      impact on and with society.\\n\\nOne of my heroes in life is Pippi Langstr\xF6m,
      or Pippie Langkous in\\nDutch. I used to watch her show when I was little. Pippi
      has this\\nsaying: \\\"I have never tried this before, so I think I should definitely\\nbe
      able to do that.\\\" I love it. And I believe that we need to reward\\nthis
      type of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We\\nshould
      foster taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our\\ncomfort zone,
      and being bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously.\\nBut in fact, we
      see the opposite happen among early career researchers.\\nMany of them suffer
      from [anxiety and an unhealthy pressure to conform\\nto a problematic\\nnorm](https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306_Improving-mental-health-of-early-career-researchers-2.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHelping

      of the ''European Open\nScience Cloud'' as a central platform to publish, find
      and reuse research\nassets. Simultaneously, European funding prioritises open
      science\npractices in the form of sharing of publications and data ''as open

      relating this ambiguity to research(er) assessment, it becomes\nevident that

      of publication-driven research(er) assessments.\nThis urges research assessment
      to be reconsidered in the light of open\nscience. Luckily, there has been much
      work in making research(er)\nassessment more polychromatic. This has been spearheaded
      by initiatives\nsuch as [DORA](https://sfdora.org/about-dora/){target=\"_blank\"},
      has\nstabilised with the formulation of the [Hong Kong\nPrinciples](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      recently has institutionalised in the [Coalition for Advancing\nResearch Assessment](https://coara.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}
      (COARA); a\nmassive undertaking that supports the adoption of responsible research\nassessment
      practices across knowledge producing organisations. Indeed,\nCoARA''s description
      on their webpage summarises briefly what responsible\nresearch assessment means
      for them:\n\nSimilarly to open science, [responsible research assessment describes
      a\nbroad range of\naspirations](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/navigating-responsible-research-assessment-guidelines#:~:text=RRA%20%22is%20an%20umbrella%20term,diverse%20and%20inclusive%20research%20cultures.%22){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      research assessment that largely focus on the responsible use of\nresearch metrics
      in assessment contexts and the fostering of an\ninclusive and diverse research
      culture in science through assessment.\nThese developments in research assessment
      recognise and promote\npractices that paint a more polychromatic picture of
      science, where\nresearch(ers) are recognised and rewarded for more than the
      outputs they\nproduce.\n\nBoth developments -- open science and responsible
      research assessment --\nhave a unique opportunity to strengthen and reinforce
      one another.\nResearch assessment reform can provide the institutional incentives
      to\nthe adoption of open scientific practices in research, and the diversity\nof
      practices promoted under open science can serve the reform of\nresearch(er)
      assessment. However, despite this promising interrelation,\nboth movements risk
      developing in parallel to one another as long as\nquestions about the aspirations
      of open science are not discussed with\nthe affordances of responsible research
      assessment in mind.\n\nIndeed, there is ongoing work to illuminate these complexities
      in the\nform of various European Commission-funded projects. How research(er)\nassessment
      that considers opens science can play out in practice is\nbeing researched by
      [GraspOS](https://graspos.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}, a\nproject which is concerned
      with how infrastructures afford the uptake of\nresearch assessment that values
      open science. The project\n[OPUS](https://opusproject.eu/about/){target=\"_blank\"}
      focuses on\nindicators for the assessment of researchers in the context of open\nscience.
      [PathOS](https://pathos-project.eu/){target=\"_blank\"} tries to\nbetter understand
      the impacts of open science. Similarly, the [SUPER\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/transition-in-science/){target=\"_blank\"}\nproject
      developed an [evaluation and monitoring\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i)\nfor
      responsible research and innovation in Europe that, in many ways,\nrelates to
      reconfigurations in knowledge production as posited under the\nbanner of open
      science as well.\n\nEarly reflections from these projects and related communities
      can be\nbrought forward with [Sabina Leonelli''s recent book\n(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009416368){target=\"_blank\"}.
      She\ndescribes open science as backed by a rationale that relies on a strong\norientation
      towards the sharing of objects of science. These objects do\nnot necessarily
      describe how research is done, but are themselves\n(by)products of research,
      including data, publications, models, codes et\ncetera. In this notion of science,
      *access* to existing scholarship and\nrelated objects becomes conditional for
      successful open science.\n\nIndeed, this notion of open science is widely shared
      and is often\nreinforced in research(er) assessments that consider open science\nthrough
      the enrolment of object-oriented knowledge that comes in the\nform of indicators
      describing e.g., open access outputs. However, these\nresearch assessments only
      make visible a very narrow interpretation of\nopenness in science and obscure
      descriptions of how research *is done*\n-- which is a key consideration for
      recognising and rewarding\nresearchers on responsible conduct of research, transdisciplinary
      work\nand other ''broader'' interpretations that can be found in the\n[UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi){target=\"_blank\"}\nconceptualisation
      of openness; and often remain invisible.\n\nThis gives rise to interesting questions
      about capturing immaterial\nproperties of research, in particular when it comes
      to shared knowledge\nproduction processes and how they reconfigure values and
      relations or\nbring up matters of collective concern. These dimensions of research
      are\nstill widely underrepresented and unaddressed in research(er)\nassessments
      in the context of (open) science.\n\nConclusively, research(er) assessment that
      considers open science is\nstill in a nascent stage. It is therefore critical
      to collate and\nexchange experiences of practical attempts to conduct research\nassessment
      that considers open science. At GraspOS, we will ask these\nquestions in bimonthly
      online meetings starting 18 October 2023 and\npresent ongoing stories from universities,
      national funders, thematic\nresearch clusters to discuss the multiple ways in
      which (responsible)\nresearch assessment considers open science.\n\nWe hope
      to hear stories about issues, frustrations and successes of\nresearch assessment
      in relation to open science. Finally, the goal of\nthis community is to create

      and integrity, collective benefits, equity and fairness,\\nand diversity and

      science as a policy priority\\nwith considerable investment in the development
      of the 'European Open\\nScience Cloud' as a central platform to publish, find
      and reuse research\\nassets. Simultaneously, European funding prioritises open
      science\\npractices in the form of sharing of publications and data 'as open
      as\\npossible and as closed as necessary'.\\n\\nIndeed it seems that these policy
      investments do carry fruits as can be\\nseen in the formation of national bodies,
      like\_[Open Science\\nNetherlands](https://www.openscience.nl/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      enacted in multiple ways across different research communities.\\nConceptions
      range from purely output-oriented notions surrounding open\\naccess to process-oriented
      priorities, such as engaging non-academics in\\nknowledge production. As my

      \ \\n\\nWhen relating this ambiguity to research(er) assessment, it becomes\\nevident
      that the proliferation of open science practices challenges the\\nmonochromatic
      properties of publication-driven research(er) assessments.\\nThis urges research
      assessment to be reconsidered in the light of open\\nscience. Luckily, there
      has been much work in making research(er)\\nassessment more polychromatic. This
      has been spearheaded by initiatives\\nsuch as [DORA](https://sfdora.org/about-dora/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      has\\nstabilised with the formulation of the [Hong Kong\\nPrinciples](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000737){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      recently has institutionalised in the [Coalition for Advancing\\nResearch Assessment](https://coara.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (COARA); a\\nmassive undertaking that supports the adoption of responsible research\\nassessment
      practices across knowledge producing organisations. Indeed,\\nCoARA's description
      on their webpage summarises briefly what responsible\\nresearch assessment means
      for them:\\n\\nSimilarly to open science, [responsible research assessment describes
      a\\nbroad range of\\naspirations](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/navigating-responsible-research-assessment-guidelines#:~:text=RRA%20%22is%20an%20umbrella%20term,diverse%20and%20inclusive%20research%20cultures.%22){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      research assessment that largely focus on the responsible use of\\nresearch
      metrics in assessment contexts and the fostering of an\\ninclusive and diverse
      research culture in science through assessment.\\nThese developments in research
      assessment recognise and promote\\npractices that paint a more polychromatic
      picture of science, where\\nresearch(ers) are recognised and rewarded for more
      than the outputs they\\nproduce.\\n\\nBoth developments -- open science and
      responsible research assessment --\\nhave a unique opportunity to strengthen
      and reinforce one another.\\nResearch assessment reform can provide the institutional
      incentives to\\nthe adoption of open scientific practices in research, and the
      diversity\\nof practices promoted under open science can serve the reform of\\nresearch(er)
      assessment. However, despite this promising interrelation,\\nboth movements
      risk developing in parallel to one another as long as\\nquestions about the
      aspirations of open science are not discussed with\\nthe affordances of responsible
      research assessment in mind.\\n\\nIndeed, there is ongoing work to illuminate
      these complexities in the\\nform of various European Commission-funded projects.
      How research(er)\\nassessment that considers opens science can play out in practice
      is\\nbeing researched by [GraspOS](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      a\\nproject which is concerned with how infrastructures afford the uptake of\\nresearch
      assessment that values open science. The project\\n[OPUS](https://opusproject.eu/about/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      focuses on\\nindicators for the assessment of researchers in the context of
      open\\nscience. [PathOS](https://pathos-project.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      tries to\\nbetter understand the impacts of open science. Similarly, the [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/transition-in-science/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      developed an [evaluation and monitoring\\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i)\\nfor
      responsible research and innovation in Europe that, in many ways,\\nrelates
      to reconfigurations in knowledge production as posited under the\\nbanner of
      open science as well.\\n\\nEarly reflections from these projects and related
      communities can be\\nbrought forward with [Sabina Leonelli's recent book\\n(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009416368){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      She\\ndescribes open science as backed by a rationale that relies on a strong\\norientation
      towards the sharing of objects of science. These objects do\\nnot necessarily
      describe how research is done, but are themselves\\n(by)products of research,
      including data, publications, models, codes et\\ncetera. In this notion of science,
      *access* to existing scholarship and\\nrelated objects becomes conditional for
      successful open science.\\n\\nIndeed, this notion of open science is widely
      shared and is often\\nreinforced in research(er) assessments that consider open
      science\\nthrough the enrolment of object-oriented knowledge that comes in the\\nform
      of indicators describing e.g., open access outputs. However, these\\nresearch
      assessments only make visible a very narrow interpretation of\\nopenness in
      science and obscure descriptions of how research *is done*\\n-- which is a key
      consideration for recognising and rewarding\\nresearchers on responsible conduct
      of research, transdisciplinary work\\nand other 'broader' interpretations that
      can be found in the\\n[UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nconceptualisation
      of openness; and often remain invisible.\\n\\nThis gives rise to interesting
      questions about capturing immaterial\\nproperties of research, in particular
      when it comes to shared knowledge\\nproduction processes and how they reconfigure
      values and relations or\\nbring up matters of collective concern. These dimensions
      of research are\\nstill widely underrepresented and unaddressed in research(er)\\nassessments
      in the context of (open) science.\\n\\nConclusively, research(er) assessment
      that considers open science is\\nstill in a nascent stage. It is therefore critical
      to collate and\\nexchange experiences of practical attempts to conduct research\\nassessment
      that considers open science. At GraspOS, we will ask these\\nquestions in bimonthly
      online meetings starting 18 October 2023 and\\npresent ongoing stories from
      universities, national funders, thematic\\nresearch clusters to discuss the
      multiple ways in which (responsible)\\nresearch assessment considers open science.\\n\\nWe
      hope to hear stories about issues, frustrations and successes of\\nresearch
      assessment in relation to open science. Finally, the goal of\\nthis community
      is to create a bouquet of stories from which we can learn\\nand draw inspiration

      global university rankings have gained\nincreasing prominence within the higher
      education landscape. Originally\ndesigned as marketing and benchmarking tools,
      the rankings have\ntransformed into influential instruments for research evaluation
      and\npolicymaking. Acknowledging the vast impact they have had on the field,\n[my
      recent\nstudy](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hykze){target=\"_blank\"} aims
      to\nprovide an extensive overview of the literature pertaining to the use of\nuniversity
      rankings in research evaluation and excellence initiatives.\n\nThe paper presents
      a systematic review of existing literature on\nrankings in the context of research
      evaluation and excellence\ninitiatives. English-language sources primarily constitute
      the basis of\nthis review, although additional coverage is given to literature
      from\nRussia, where the significance of rankings in the national policy was\nemphasized
      in the title and objective of the policy project 5top100 (the\nreview covers
      only a relatively small part of Russian-language\nliterature on rankings; an
      extended study of the Russian academic\nliterature is available\n[here](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9gdy2){target=\"_blank\"}).\nFurthermore,
      gray literature has also been included for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of
      the topic.\n\n### **The attitudes towards university rankings and their use
      in research evaluation in academic and gray literature**\n\nThe literature analysis
      reveals a prevailing academic consensus that\nrankings should not be employed
      as a sole measure of research assessment\nand indicators of the national policies.
      Rankings can be used for\nmarketing and benchmarking functions, but in a responsible
      way by\nrecognizing their limitations. Various authors have highlighted\ntechnical
      and methodological flaws, biases of different nature\n(including biased evaluation
      of both universities and individual\nresearchers), conflicts of interest, and
      risks to national identity.\nCriticism is mainly focused on rankings that use
      a composite indicator\nas a single overall measure of university performance
      (QS, THE, and\nARWU). Rather few studies demonstrate a positive or neutral attitude\ntowards
      global university rankings. The key findings from the literature\nare summarized
      in the diagram below.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Picture1.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"35814\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 1: Map of views on global university rankings and\ntheir
      use in research evaluation</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \nIt is noteworthy to
      observe that the perception of global university\nrankings in gray publications
      has undergone a substantial evolution.\nDuring the 2000s and early 2010s, there
      existed a favorable outlook on\nuniversity rankings, with policymakers and certain
      academics endorsing\ntheir use to gauge the excellence of higher education institutions
      on a\nglobal scale, to some extent. In recent years, there has been a\ndiscernible
      shift in the perspective in the gray literature towards\nuniversity rankings,
      becoming more inclined towards a critical view.\n\n### Rankings and research
      evaluation in the Russian science system\n\nRankings played an incredibly significant
      role in Russian national\npolicy. In 2013-2020, the Russian government implemented
      the 5top100\nproject aimed at getting five Russian universities into the top
      100 of\nglobal university rankings. The goal of the project was not achieved,\nbut
      some experts noted positive changes, primarily an increase in the\nnumber of
      publications by Russian universities. The 5top100 project was\ncontinued within
      the framework of the [Priority-2030\nprogram](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThis
      ongoing policy initiative is also aimed at promoting the\ndevelopment and advancement
      of national universities. One distinct\naspect of this program is its rejection
      of global university rankings as\nthe sole basis of evaluation. By moving away
      from a narrow reliance on\nglobal rankings, the program aims to foster a more
      holistic and\ncontext-specific approach to assessing the performance and progress
      of\nRussian universities. However, a considerable proportion of evaluation\nin
      Priority-2030 still depends on quantitative indicators also used in\nthe methodologies
      of global university rankings, in particular the\nscoring of publications based
      on the indexing of journals in Scopus or\nWeb of Science.\n\nDespite the [rosy\nreports](https://ach.gov.ru/statements/byulleten-schetnoy-palaty-2-279-2021-g){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      Russian universities moving up in the rankings and increasing their\npublications,
      it suddenly turned out that the country did not have\nenough technological competencies
      to [produce car\npaint](https://www.forbes.ru/biznes/484319-avtovaz-peresel-na-vypusk-lada-v-treh-cvetah-iz-za-deficita-kraski){target=\"_blank\"}\nor
      [starter cultures for dairy\nproducts](https://www.rbc.ru/business/02/02/2023/63d68c1b9a79473f53d7403b){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      situation appears to be even more concerning when examining the\nanalysis of
      ranking positions for 28 Russian universities that sought\nconsulting services
      from Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) between 2016 and 2021\n(see [the analysis by
      Igor\nChirikov](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00942-5){target=\"_blank\"}).\nThe
      findings revealed an unusual increase in ranking positions that\ncould not be
      justified by any observable changes in the universities\\''\ncharacteristics,
      as indicated by national statistics. This phenomenon,\ntermed \\\"self-bias\\\"
      by the author, raises questions about the validity\nof these rankings. It is
      worth noting that in the latest edition of the\nQS ranking, all Russian universities
      experienced a significant decline\nin their positions. This begs the question:
      were Russian universities\nperforming well previously, and has there been a
      noticeable\ndeterioration in their activities lately? Overall, it is my belief
      that\nrelying solely on university rankings cannot provide a reliable answer\nto
      these inquiries.\n\nBack to the literature review, I must admit that the scope
      of topics\ncovered in Russian-language literature regarding rankings is remarkably\nlimited,
      with the dominant theme revolving around competitiveness.\nFurthermore, there
      is a striking lack of overlap between academic and\ngray literature in Russian
      compared to English-language sources. In\nfact, the only point of intersection
      is the neo-colonial discourse,\nwhich considers rankings as a tool for promoting
      the Western model of\nhigher education. Some authors also point out the difference
      between the\nWestern and Russian model of higher education, for instance, [Lazar\n(2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.33933/2074-2762-2019-54-134-144){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      Western countries, science and higher education have traditionally\ncoexisted
      within universities, with applied research being actively\ndeveloped through
      the participation of businesses. In contrast, in\nRussia, since the times of
      the USSR, there has been a \\\"research triad\\\"\nconsisting of the Academy
      of Sciences, industry design bureaus, and\nresearch institutes, while universities
      and industry institutes have\nprimarily focused on personnel training with government
      funding. As a\nresult, both fundamental and applied research has historically
      been\nlargely conducted outside of universities in Russia.\n\nThe topic of responsible
      research evaluation is poorly developed in\nRussia. Regrettably, this indicates
      the isolated nature of Russian\nscience and educational policy debates, which
      obviously hampers the\nprospects for development.\n\n### What to do in this
      situation?\n\nI believe the problem described above concerns not only Russia.
      Although\nthe degree of influence is different, the rankings continue to shape\nnational
      and institutional strategies in higher education practically\nall over the world.\n\nI
      have emphasized the inherent complexity of dismissing rankings\noutright since
      they continue to serve as effective marketing tools.\nHaving said that, I must
      also acknowledge the complexity of cultural\nchange. Even now [some people\nbelieve](https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-2272-2022-22-4-909-918){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      university rankings measure the international prestige of the\ncountry *\"based
      on the objective assessment by experts from different\ncountries of the significant
      achievements of universities.\"*\n\nA [recent report by the Universities of
      the\nNetherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/nieuws-detail/nieuwsbericht/915-p-dutch-universities-to-take-different-approach-to-rankings-p.html){target=\"_blank\"}\nproposed
      a strategy deal with university rankings in more responsible\nways. This entails
      the implementation of initiatives at three levels. In\nthe short term, universities
      should embark on individual initiatives. In\nthe medium term, coordinated initiatives
      should be undertaken at the\nnational level, such as collaborative efforts by
      all universities in the\nNetherlands. In the longer term, coordinated initiatives
      are to be set\nup at the international level.\n\nAt present, I would suggest
      focusing on several specific stops:\n\n- Stop evaluating academics based on
      university ranking indicators.\n  Start rewarding the contributions of faculty
      and researchers in all\n  areas of university activities.\n- Stop constructing
      university strategies based on university rankings.\n  Do not use ranking tiers
      in analytical reports for management decision\n  making; instead, focus on the
      actual contributions made by a\n  university (scientific, educational, and societal).\n-
      Stop evaluating universities based on ranking indicators. Every\n  university
      has a unique mission, and only fulfillment of this mission\n  really matters.\n-
      Stop using ranking information in national strategies and other kinds\n  of
      ambitions. Only universities'' contributions to national and global\n  goals
      should be considered.\n- Stop paying money for consulting services to ranking
      compliers. This\n  is a pure conflict of interests.\n\nHowever, the change starts
      with each of us. Every time that we say or\npost in social media something like

      coverage is given to literature from\\nRussia, where the significance of rankings
      in the national policy was\\nemphasized in the title and objective of the policy

      in research evaluation in academic and gray literature**\\n\\nThe literature
      analysis reveals a prevailing academic consensus that\\nrankings should not
      be employed as a sole measure of research assessment\\nand indicators of the
      national policies. Rankings can be used for\\nmarketing and benchmarking functions,
      but in a responsible way by\\nrecognizing their limitations. Various authors
      have highlighted\\ntechnical and methodological flaws, biases of different nature\\n(including
      biased evaluation of both universities and individual\\nresearchers), conflicts
      of interest, and risks to national identity.\\nCriticism is mainly focused on
      rankings that use a composite indicator\\nas a single overall measure of university
      performance (QS, THE, and\\nARWU). Rather few studies demonstrate a positive
      or neutral attitude\\ntowards global university rankings. The key findings from
      the literature\\nare summarized in the diagram below.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Picture1.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"35814\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1: Map of views on global university rankings and\\ntheir
      use in research evaluation</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nIt is noteworthy
      to observe that the perception of global university\\nrankings in gray publications
      has undergone a substantial evolution.\\nDuring the 2000s and early 2010s, there
      existed a favorable outlook on\\nuniversity rankings, with policymakers and
      certain academics endorsing\\ntheir use to gauge the excellence of higher education
      institutions on a\\nglobal scale, to some extent. In recent years, there has
      been a\\ndiscernible shift in the perspective in the gray literature towards\\nuniversity
      rankings, becoming more inclined towards a critical view.\\n\\n### Rankings
      and research evaluation in the Russian science system\\n\\nRankings played an
      incredibly significant role in Russian national\\npolicy. In 2013-2020, the
      Russian government implemented the 5top100\\nproject aimed at getting five Russian
      universities into the top 100 of\\nglobal university rankings. The goal of the
      project was not achieved,\\nbut some experts noted positive changes, primarily
      an increase in the\\nnumber of publications by Russian universities. The 5top100
      project was\\ncontinued within the framework of the [Priority-2030\\nprogram](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      ongoing policy initiative is also aimed at promoting the\\ndevelopment and advancement
      of national universities. One distinct\\naspect of this program is its rejection
      of global university rankings as\\nthe sole basis of evaluation. By moving away
      from a narrow reliance on\\nglobal rankings, the program aims to foster a more
      holistic and\\ncontext-specific approach to assessing the performance and progress
      of\\nRussian universities. However, a considerable proportion of evaluation\\nin
      Priority-2030 still depends on quantitative indicators also used in\\nthe methodologies
      of global university rankings, in particular the\\nscoring of publications based
      on the indexing of journals in Scopus or\\nWeb of Science.\\n\\nDespite the
      [rosy\\nreports](https://ach.gov.ru/statements/byulleten-schetnoy-palaty-2-279-2021-g){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      Russian universities moving up in the rankings and increasing their\\npublications,
      it suddenly turned out that the country did not have\\nenough technological
      competencies to [produce car\\npaint](https://www.forbes.ru/biznes/484319-avtovaz-peresel-na-vypusk-lada-v-treh-cvetah-iz-za-deficita-kraski){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor

      situation appears to be even more concerning when examining the\\nanalysis of
      ranking positions for 28 Russian universities that sought\\nconsulting services
      from Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) between 2016 and 2021\\n(see [the analysis by
      Igor\\nChirikov](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00942-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nThe
      findings revealed an unusual increase in ranking positions that\\ncould not
      be justified by any observable changes in the universities\\\\'\\ncharacteristics,
      as indicated by national statistics. This phenomenon,\\ntermed \\\\\\\"self-bias\\\\\\\"
      by the author, raises questions about the validity\\nof these rankings. It is
      worth noting that in the latest edition of the\\nQS ranking, all Russian universities
      experienced a significant decline\\nin their positions. This begs the question:
      were Russian universities\\nperforming well previously, and has there been a
      noticeable\\ndeterioration in their activities lately? Overall, it is my belief
      that\\nrelying solely on university rankings cannot provide a reliable answer\\nto
      these inquiries.\\n\\nBack to the literature review, I must admit that the scope
      of topics\\ncovered in Russian-language literature regarding rankings is remarkably\\nlimited,
      with the dominant theme revolving around competitiveness.\\nFurthermore, there
      is a striking lack of overlap between academic and\\ngray literature in Russian
      compared to English-language sources. In\\nfact, the only point of intersection
      is the neo-colonial discourse,\\nwhich considers rankings as a tool for promoting
      the Western model of\\nhigher education. Some authors also point out the difference
      between the\\nWestern and Russian model of higher education, for instance, [Lazar\\n(2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.33933/2074-2762-2019-54-134-144){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      Western countries, science and higher education have traditionally\\ncoexisted
      within universities, with applied research being actively\\ndeveloped through
      the participation of businesses. In contrast, in\\nRussia, since the times of
      the USSR, there has been a \\\\\\\"research triad\\\\\\\"\\nconsisting of the
      Academy of Sciences, industry design bureaus, and\\nresearch institutes, while
      universities and industry institutes have\\nprimarily focused on personnel training
      with government funding. As a\\nresult, both fundamental and applied research
      has historically been\\nlargely conducted outside of universities in Russia.\\n\\nThe
      topic of responsible research evaluation is poorly developed in\\nRussia. Regrettably,
      this indicates the isolated nature of Russian\\nscience and educational policy
      debates, which obviously hampers the\\nprospects for development.\\n\\n### What
      to do in this situation?\\n\\nI believe the problem described above concerns
      not only Russia. Although\\nthe degree of influence is different, the rankings
      continue to shape\\nnational and institutional strategies in higher education
      practically\\nall over the world.\\n\\nI have emphasized the inherent complexity
      of dismissing rankings\\noutright since they continue to serve as effective
      marketing tools.\\nHaving said that, I must also acknowledge the complexity
      of cultural\\nchange. Even now [some people\\nbelieve](https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-2272-2022-22-4-909-918){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      university rankings measure the international prestige of the\\ncountry *\\\"based
      on the objective assessment by experts from different\\ncountries of the significant
      achievements of universities.\\\"*\\n\\nA [recent report by the Universities
      of the\\nNetherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/nieuws-detail/nieuwsbericht/915-p-dutch-universities-to-take-different-approach-to-rankings-p.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproposed
      a strategy deal with university rankings in more responsible\\nways. This entails
      the implementation of initiatives at three levels. In\\nthe short term, universities
      should embark on individual initiatives. In\\nthe medium term, coordinated initiatives
      should be undertaken at the\\nnational level, such as collaborative efforts
      by all universities in the\\nNetherlands. In the longer term, coordinated initiatives
      are to be set\\nup at the international level.\\n\\nAt present, I would suggest
      focusing on several specific stops:\\n\\n- Stop evaluating academics based on
      university ranking indicators.\\n  Start rewarding the contributions of faculty
      and researchers in all\\n  areas of university activities.\\n- Stop constructing
      university strategies based on university rankings.\\n  Do not use ranking tiers
      in analytical reports for management decision\\n  making; instead, focus on
      the actual contributions made by a\\n  university (scientific, educational,
      and societal).\\n- Stop evaluating universities based on ranking indicators.
      Every\\n  university has a unique mission, and only fulfillment of this mission\\n
      \ really matters.\\n- Stop using ranking information in national strategies
      and other kinds\\n  of ambitions. Only universities' contributions to national
      and global\\n  goals should be considered.\\n- Stop paying money for consulting
      services to ranking compliers. This\\n  is a pure conflict of interests.\\n\\nHowever,
      the change starts with each of us. Every time that we say or\\npost in social
      media something like \\\"My university has advanced N\\npositions in ranking
      X\\\", this adds to the validity of rankings in the\\neyes of potential customers.
      By refraining from making such statements,\\nevery member of academic community
      can contribute to reducing the\\nharmful impact of rankings.\\n\\n[**  \\nCompeting

      Igor\\nChirikov](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00942-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nThe
      findings revealed an unusual increase in ranking positions that\\ncould not
      be justified by any observable changes in the universities\\\\'\\ncharacteristics,
      as indicated by national statistics. This phenomenon,\\ntermed \\\\\\\"self-bias\\\\\\\"
      by the author, raises questions about the validity\\nof these rankings. It is
      worth noting that in the latest edition of the\\nQS ranking, all Russian universities
      experienced a significant decline\\nin their positions. This begs the question:
      were Russian universities\\nperforming well previously, and has there been a
      noticeable\\ndeterioration in their activities lately? Overall, it is my belief
      that\\nrelying solely on university rankings cannot provide a reliable answer\\nto
      these inquiries.\\n\\nBack to the literature review, I must admit that the scope
      of topics\\ncovered in Russian-language literature regarding rankings is remarkably\\nlimited,
      with the dominant theme revolving around competitiveness.\\nFurthermore, there
      is a striking lack of overlap between academic and\\ngray literature in Russian
      compared to English-language sources. In\\nfact, the only point of intersection
      is the neo-colonial discourse,\\nwhich considers rankings as a tool for promoting
      the Western model of\\nhigher education. Some authors also point out the difference
      between the\\nWestern and Russian model of higher education, for instance, [Lazar\\n(2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.33933/2074-2762-2019-54-134-144){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      Western countries, science and higher education have traditionally\\ncoexisted
      within universities, with applied research being actively\\ndeveloped through
      the participation of businesses. In contrast, in\\nRussia, since the times of
      the USSR, there has been a \\\\\\\"research triad\\\\\\\"\\nconsisting of the
      Academy of Sciences, industry design bureaus, and\\nresearch institutes, while
      universities and industry institutes have\\nprimarily focused on personnel training
      with government funding. As a\\nresult, both fundamental and applied research
      has historically been\\nlargely conducted outside of universities in Russia.\\n\\nThe
      topic of responsible research evaluation is poorly developed in\\nRussia. Regrettably,
      this indicates the isolated nature of Russian\\nscience and educational policy
      debates, which obviously hampers the\\nprospects for development.\\n\\n### What
      to do in this situation?\\n\\nI believe the problem described above concerns
      not only Russia. Although\\nthe degree of influence is different, the rankings
      continue to shape\\nnational and institutional strategies in higher education
      practically\\nall over the world.\\n\\nI have emphasized the inherent complexity
      of dismissing rankings\\noutright since they continue to serve as effective
      marketing tools.\\nHaving said that, I must also acknowledge the complexity
      of cultural\\nchange. Even now [some people\\nbelieve](https://doi.org/10.22363/2313-2272-2022-22-4-909-918){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat
      university rankings measure the international prestige of the\\ncountry *\\\"based
      on the objective assessment by experts from different\\ncountries of the significant
      achievements of universities.\\\"*\\n\\nA [recent report by the Universities
      of the\\nNetherlands](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB/nieuws-detail/nieuwsbericht/915-p-dutch-universities-to-take-different-approach-to-rankings-p.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproposed
      a strategy deal with university rankings in more responsible\\nways. This entails
      the implementation of initiatives at three levels. In\\nthe short term, universities
      should embark on individual initiatives. In\\nthe medium term, coordinated initiatives
      should be undertaken at the\\nnational level, such as collaborative efforts
      by all universities in the\\nNetherlands. In the longer term, coordinated initiatives
      are to be set\\nup at the international level.\\n\\nAt present, I would suggest
      focusing on several specific stops:\\n\\n- Stop evaluating academics based on
      university ranking indicators.\\n  Start rewarding the contributions of faculty
      and researchers in all\\n  areas of university activities.\\n- Stop constructing
      university strategies based on university rankings.\\n  Do not use ranking tiers
      in analytical reports for management decision\\n  making; instead, focus on
      the actual contributions made by a\\n  university (scientific, educational,
      and societal).\\n- Stop evaluating universities based on ranking indicators.
      Every\\n  university has a unique mission, and only fulfillment of this mission\\n
      \ really matters.\\n- Stop using ranking information in national strategies
      and other kinds\\n  of ambitions. Only universities' contributions to national
      and global\\n  goals should be considered.\\n- Stop paying money for consulting
      services to ranking compliers. This\\n  is a pure conflict of interests.\\n\\nHowever,
      the change starts with each of us. Every time that we say or\\npost in social
      media something like \\\"My university has advanced N\\npositions in ranking
      X\\\", this adds to the validity of rankings in the\\neyes of potential customers.
      By refraining from making such statements,\\nevery member of academic community
      can contribute to reducing the\\nharmful impact of rankings.\\n\\n[**  \\nCompeting

      "### How agriculture benefits from research through extension and engagement\n\nDifferent
      sectors benefit from science in different ways. In the case of\nagriculture,
      [innovations based on science often originate from\nproviders](https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-7333(84)90018-0){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      farmers, for example in the form of seeds or machinery. However, the\ndiffusion
      or uptake of innovations is difficult, in particular for small\nfarmers. For
      this reason, the dissemination of agricultural research\nthrough initiatives
      like ''extension'' programs has long been recognized\nas essential for development.\n\nThese
      extension activities to reach out to small farmers are\nparticularly important
      in relation to improving livelihoods. In 2020,\n[720-811 million were suffering
      from\nhunger](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/){target=\"_blank\"}\nworldwide,
      of which 50% were estimated to be small farmers. This means\nthat improving
      food security requires forms of research transfer and\nlocal and indigenous
      knowledge integration that reach out to small\nfarmers, who constitute a particularly
      vulnerable group.\n\nPublic organisations working on agriculture have long been
      aware of the\ncentrality of ''extension'' for improving rural livelihoods. The
      reason is\nthat agriculture depends heavily on contexts, and agricultural contexts\nmay
      change dramatically across short geographical distances due to\nvariations in
      climate and soils. The notion of ''extension'' research\ngradually shifted from
      top-down, unidirectional teaching from\nresearchers to farmers, toward more
      mutual learning and co-operation\nbetween researchers and farmers, so that science
      can respond to these\nlocal needs and contexts. Through [participatory and learning\napproaches](https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods){target=\"_blank\"}\ncan
      technical and local knowledge be combined in order to achieve\nappropriate technologies.\n\n###
      The lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture may lead to use of
      inappropriate technology\n\nHowever, research that is more engaged with users
      and more orientated\ntowards application tends to be associated with lower academic\nvisibility,
      because its publications are often not included in the\nmainstream bibliographic
      databases.\n\n[Various\nstudies](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/){target=\"_blank\"}\nhave
      shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in\nmainstream databases
      is lower than in the natural sciences, but well\nabove the social sciences and
      the humanities. Yet the situation is much\nworse in terms of the coverage of
      the Global South in the mainstream\ndatabases. For example, [studies by Subbiah\nArunachalam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by Indian researchers in\nagricultural
      research, 78% were in Indian journals and 77% were not\nindexed by Web of Science.
      Other studies have highlighted that crops\nrelevant in the Global South also
      have a much lower coverage in Web of\nScience (WoS), for example [the crop pearl\nmillet](http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n[A
      study on rice\nresearch](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/){target=\"_blank\"}\nfound
      that coverage of publications in mainstream databases was 2 to\n3-fold higher
      for the Global North. Similarly, the coverage of topics\nrelevant to the Global
      North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold higher than\nthe topics more relevant in
      the Global South -- as illustrated in Figure\n1 for the case of rice research.\n\nGiven
      that the mission of agricultural research institutes and councils\nis to increase
      food security, reduce poverty and improve natural\necosystems, knowledge communicated
      through a plurality of channels\nshould be valued beyond mainstream international
      journals. This would\ninclude, for example, publication formats such as those
      collected by FAO\nin its [AGRIS database](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      (based\non national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage
      of\nmore diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison\nto
      citation index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing\ndatabases
      such as CAB Abstracts.\n\nThis lack of visibility has at least two downsides.
      First, universities\nor research institutes conducting extension programmes
      or engaged\nagricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing\nprestigious
      science -- as excellence has increasingly been defined\naccording to publications
      in prestigious journals. As a result,\nresearchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by ''top'' journals,\nwhich are mostly focused on topics in the
      Global North.\n\n<figure class=\"image-full landscape\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Coverage of publications on rice research across\ntwo
      mainstream databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and a\ndatabase with
      a larger coverage of the Global South, CAB Abstracts\n(2003-12). Topics which
      are more relevant for the Global North (such as\nmolecular biology) have a much
      higher coverage than topics relevant to\nsmall farmers in the Global South (such
      as plant characteristics or\nprotection). <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Source:
      Rafols, Ciarli and Chavarro\n(2015).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nSecond,
      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic\nSearch Engine
      Optimization for Open Access content, valuable contextual\nknowledge is harder
      to discover, making it challenging to retrieve or\naccess it. In consequence,
      technical experts in agriculture in the\nGlobal South are more likely to apply
      technologies which are\ninappropriate in their countries. For instance, the
      crop varieties that\nare available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties
      for a\ntropical context, and information about the crops may be appropriate
      for\nEurope but inappropriate in Brazil or India. Including more local\nagricultural
      journals in bibliographic databases could help promote\nlocal agricultural solutions,
      as researchers and practitioners would\nhave access to a wider range of information
      and perspectives.\n\n[A recent\nstudy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3886019){target=\"_blank\"}\nshows
      that countries in Africa and Asia suffer a much higher loss of\nproductivity
      in agriculture than countries in Europe and the Americas as\na consequence of
      the use of inappropriate technologies, where the degree\nof inappropriateness
      is estimated as the mismatch in the presence of\ncrop-specific pests and pathogens
      (see Figure 2). This inappropriate use\nof agricultural technologies is partly
      due to the lower amount of\nresearch in topics and areas of interest of the
      Global South, but also\npartly due to the challenges in locating and accessing
      contextualised\nknowledge which already exists but is published in local venues\n(journals,
      reports, policy documents, etc.).\n\n<figure class=\"image-full landscape\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure2.png\"

      Moscona and Sastry (2022).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Towards broader
      coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases\n\nA [new\npublication](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\"_blank\"}\nby
      the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/){target=\"_blank\"}\ninterestingly
      challenges the perception, created by the conventional use\nof mainstream databases,
      that research is extremely concentrated in\njournals and publications of the
      Global North. Analysing 25,671 journals\nwith 5.8 million documents of the platform
      Open Journal System (OJS),\nthey found that 80% of the publications originated
      in the Global South,\nthat 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee for authors
      nor readers) and\nalmost half of them have more than one language.\n\nThe success
      of the OJS infrastructure in making possible access and\nvisibility of knowledge
      from the Global South suggests that it is high\ntime for the development of
      more comprehensive databases. This has been\na concern in medical research and
      social science and humanities (SSH),\nleading to the development of regional
      specialised databases such as\n[Scielo](https://scielo.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      (more on health) and\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      (more on SSH). In\nrecent years we have also witnessed the development of more\ncomprehensive
      databases like [Open\nAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/){target=\"_blank\"}
      or\n[Lens](https://www.lens.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nWe have conducted a
      small study using the [MIAR portal of the\n''Information Matrix for the Analysis
      of\nJournals''](https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en){target=\"_blank\"} of the\nUniversity
      of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal\ncoverage of various
      databases (see detailed\n[methodology](https://osf.io/fd9cv){target=\"_blank\"}
      and [journal\ndata](https://osf.io/9hdgc){target=\"_blank\"}). As shown in Figure
      3,\nfrom a sample of 1662 journals from any country with ISSN related to\nagriculture,
      we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest coverage with\n805 (48%) journals,
      562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and 550 (33%)\nof Veterinary Sciences.
      In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts and\nVeterinary Sciences have a
      better and broader coverage in the Global\nSouth in relative terms.\n\n<figure
      class=\"image-full landscape\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure3.png\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 3. Coverage of the analysed sample of 1662\nagricultural
      journals by the largest database specialised in\nagriculture, CAB Abstracts,
      in comparison to WoS and Scopus. 46% of the\njournals are not covered by any
      of these databases.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThese results have to be contrasted
      with new databases such as\n*Dimensions* and *Open Alex* that index papers rather
      than journals.\nHere we have made some estimations for *Dimensions*, which showed
      a\ncoverage of about 1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was high also in\nthe
      Global South, with 46 (41%) of African journals, against a 28 (25%)\nin CAB
      Abstracts. Only for a few countries, including Iran, Germany,\nRomania or Cuba,
      was *Dimensions* coverage lower than *CAB Abstracts*.  \n\nThe downside of these
      new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with\nthe Google Scholar Coverage)
      is the lack of inquiry of the publishing\npractices of journals. We found that
      some of the journals included in\nthe larger databases, but not present in the
      more traditional databases\nsuch as CAB Abstracts, have a higher incidence of
      problematic or\nquestionable editorial and review practices (here the term [''predatory''\nis\nunhelpful](https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\n###
      Another bibliographic coverage is possible, and necessary\n\nIn conclusion,
      another bibliographic world is possible where knowledge\nis more diverse and
      accessible -- and this is important for agricultural\nresearch to be more visible
      and accessible in and from the Global South.\nInfrastructures towards this transformation
      have to be developed to\nenhance interoperability and cooperation. This is the
      case, for example,\nof the analysis centres that feed the FAO\\''s [AGRIS information\nsystem](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      including grey\nliterature. While currently no single commercial bibliographic
      database\nhas a good coverage of agriculture, a new generation of databases
      in\nconjunction with metadata aggregators from open access repositories may\nhelp
      fill this gap. This increase in diversity of journals comes at the\ncost of
      having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal editorial\npractices. This challenge
      could be overcome with catalogues of editorial\npractices such as [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      or\n[Latindex](https://latindex.org/latindex/){target=\"_blank\"} and\nplatforms
      such as [MIAR](https://miar.ub.edu/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nIt is about time
      to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to\nprovide visibility and
      accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant\nto many more contexts, particularly
      in the Global South, so that\nknowledge of appropriate technologies can foster
      human development\nacross all the world.\n\n**Acknowledgement:** We thank Subbiah

      How agriculture benefits from research through extension and engagement\\n\\nDifferent
      sectors benefit from science in different ways. In the case of\\nagriculture,
      [innovations based on science often originate from\\nproviders](https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-7333(84)90018-0){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      farmers, for example in the form of seeds or machinery. However, the\\ndiffusion
      or uptake of innovations is difficult, in particular for small\\nfarmers. For
      this reason, the dissemination of agricultural research\\nthrough initiatives
      like 'extension' programs has long been recognized\\nas essential for development.\\n\\nThese
      extension activities to reach out to small farmers are\\nparticularly important
      in relation to improving livelihoods. In 2020,\\n[720-811 million were suffering
      from\\nhunger](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nworldwide,
      of which 50% were estimated to be small farmers. This means\\nthat improving
      food security requires forms of research transfer and\\nlocal and indigenous
      knowledge integration that reach out to small\\nfarmers, who constitute a particularly
      vulnerable group.\\n\\nPublic organisations working on agriculture have long
      been aware of the\\ncentrality of 'extension' for improving rural livelihoods.
      The reason is\\nthat agriculture depends heavily on contexts, and agricultural
      contexts\\nmay change dramatically across short geographical distances due to\\nvariations
      in climate and soils. The notion of 'extension' research\\ngradually shifted
      from top-down, unidirectional teaching from\\nresearchers to farmers, toward
      more mutual learning and co-operation\\nbetween researchers and farmers, so
      that science can respond to these\\nlocal needs and contexts. Through [participatory
      and learning\\napproaches](https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncan
      technical and local knowledge be combined in order to achieve\\nappropriate
      technologies.\\n\\n### The lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture
      may lead to use of inappropriate technology\\n\\nHowever, research that is more
      engaged with users and more orientated\\ntowards application tends to be associated
      with lower academic\\nvisibility, because its publications are often not included
      in the\\nmainstream bibliographic databases.\\n\\n[Various\\nstudies](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in\\nmainstream databases
      is lower than in the natural sciences, but well\\nabove the social sciences
      and the humanities. Yet the situation is much\\nworse in terms of the coverage
      of the Global South in the mainstream\\ndatabases. For example, [studies by
      Subbiah\\nArunachalam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by Indian researchers in\\nagricultural
      research, 78% were in Indian journals and 77% were not\\nindexed by Web of Science.
      Other studies have highlighted that crops\\nrelevant in the Global South also
      have a much lower coverage in Web of\\nScience (WoS), for example [the crop
      pearl\\nmillet](http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n[A
      study on rice\\nresearch](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfound
      that coverage of publications in mainstream databases was 2 to\\n3-fold higher
      for the Global North. Similarly, the coverage of topics\\nrelevant to the Global
      North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold higher than\\nthe topics more relevant
      in the Global South -- as illustrated in Figure\\n1 for the case of rice research.\\n\\nGiven
      that the mission of agricultural research institutes and councils\\nis to increase
      food security, reduce poverty and improve natural\\necosystems, knowledge communicated
      through a plurality of channels\\nshould be valued beyond mainstream international
      journals. This would\\ninclude, for example, publication formats such as those
      collected by FAO\\nin its [AGRIS database](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (based\\non national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage
      of\\nmore diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison\\nto
      citation index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing\\ndatabases
      such as CAB Abstracts.\\n\\nThis lack of visibility has at least two downsides.
      First, universities\\nor research institutes conducting extension programmes
      or engaged\\nagricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing\\nprestigious
      science -- as excellence has increasingly been defined\\naccording to publications
      in prestigious journals. As a result,\\nresearchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by 'top' journals,\\nwhich are mostly focused on topics in the
      Global North.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"image-full landscape\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\\\"

      mainstream databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and a\\ndatabase with

      are more relevant for the Global North (such as\\nmolecular biology) have a
      much higher coverage than topics relevant to\\nsmall farmers in the Global South

      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic\\nSearch Engine
      Optimization for Open Access content, valuable contextual\\nknowledge is harder
      to discover, making it challenging to retrieve or\\naccess it. In consequence,
      technical experts in agriculture in the\\nGlobal South are more likely to apply
      technologies which are\\ninappropriate in their countries. For instance, the
      crop varieties that\\nare available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties
      for a\\ntropical context, and information about the crops may be appropriate
      for\\nEurope but inappropriate in Brazil or India. Including more local\\nagricultural
      journals in bibliographic databases could help promote\\nlocal agricultural
      solutions, as researchers and practitioners would\\nhave access to a wider range
      of information and perspectives.\\n\\n[A recent\\nstudy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3886019){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
      that countries in Africa and Asia suffer a much higher loss of\\nproductivity
      in agriculture than countries in Europe and the Americas as\\na consequence
      of the use of inappropriate technologies, where the degree\\nof inappropriateness
      is estimated as the mismatch in the presence of\\ncrop-specific pests and pathogens
      (see Figure 2). This inappropriate use\\nof agricultural technologies is partly
      due to the lower amount of\\nresearch in topics and areas of interest of the
      Global South, but also\\npartly due to the challenges in locating and accessing
      contextualised\\nknowledge which already exists but is published in local venues\\n(journals,

      coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases\\n\\nA [new\\npublication](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ninterestingly
      challenges the perception, created by the conventional use\\nof mainstream databases,
      that research is extremely concentrated in\\njournals and publications of the
      Global North. Analysing 25,671 journals\\nwith 5.8 million documents of the
      platform Open Journal System (OJS),\\nthey found that 80% of the publications
      originated in the Global South,\\nthat 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee
      for authors nor readers) and\\nalmost half of them have more than one language.\\n\\nThe
      success of the OJS infrastructure in making possible access and\\nvisibility
      of knowledge from the Global South suggests that it is high\\ntime for the development
      of more comprehensive databases. This has been\\na concern in medical research
      and social science and humanities (SSH),\\nleading to the development of regional
      specialised databases such as\\n[Scielo](https://scielo.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on health) and\\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on SSH). In\\nrecent years we have also witnessed the development of more\\ncomprehensive
      databases like [Open\\nAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Lens](https://www.lens.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWe have conducted
      a small study using the [MIAR portal of the\\n'Information Matrix for the Analysis
      of\\nJournals'](https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} of the\\nUniversity
      of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal\\ncoverage of
      various databases (see detailed\\n[methodology](https://osf.io/fd9cv){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [journal\\ndata](https://osf.io/9hdgc){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}). As shown
      in Figure 3,\\nfrom a sample of 1662 journals from any country with ISSN related
      to\\nagriculture, we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest coverage with\\n805
      (48%) journals, 562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and 550 (33%)\\nof Veterinary
      Sciences. In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts and\\nVeterinary Sciences
      have a better and broader coverage in the Global\\nSouth in relative terms.\\n\\n<figure

      journals by the largest database specialised in\\nagriculture, CAB Abstracts,
      in comparison to WoS and Scopus. 46% of the\\njournals are not covered by any
      of these databases.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThese results have to be contrasted
      with new databases such as\\n*Dimensions* and *Open Alex* that index papers
      rather than journals.\\nHere we have made some estimations for *Dimensions*,
      which showed a\\ncoverage of about 1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was
      high also in\\nthe Global South, with 46 (41%) of African journals, against
      a 28 (25%)\\nin CAB Abstracts. Only for a few countries, including Iran, Germany,\\nRomania
      or Cuba, was *Dimensions* coverage lower than *CAB Abstracts*.  \\n\\nThe downside
      of these new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with\\nthe Google Scholar
      Coverage) is the lack of inquiry of the publishing\\npractices of journals.
      We found that some of the journals included in\\nthe larger databases, but not
      present in the more traditional databases\\nsuch as CAB Abstracts, have a higher
      incidence of problematic or\\nquestionable editorial and review practices (here
      the term ['predatory'\\nis\\nunhelpful](https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      Another bibliographic coverage is possible, and necessary\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      another bibliographic world is possible where knowledge\\nis more diverse and
      accessible -- and this is important for agricultural\\nresearch to be more visible
      and accessible in and from the Global South.\\nInfrastructures towards this
      transformation have to be developed to\\nenhance interoperability and cooperation.
      This is the case, for example,\\nof the analysis centres that feed the FAO\\\\'s
      [AGRIS information\\nsystem](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      including grey\\nliterature. While currently no single commercial bibliographic
      database\\nhas a good coverage of agriculture, a new generation of databases
      in\\nconjunction with metadata aggregators from open access repositories may\\nhelp
      fill this gap. This increase in diversity of journals comes at the\\ncost of
      having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal editorial\\npractices. This challenge
      could be overcome with catalogues of editorial\\npractices such as [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Latindex](https://latindex.org/latindex/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and\\nplatforms
      such as [MIAR](https://miar.ub.edu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIt is about
      time to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to\\nprovide visibility
      and accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant\\nto many more contexts,
      particularly in the Global South, so that\\nknowledge of appropriate technologies
      can foster human development\\nacross all the world.\\n\\n**Acknowledgement:**

      in climate and soils. The notion of 'extension' research\\ngradually shifted
      from top-down, unidirectional teaching from\\nresearchers to farmers, toward
      more mutual learning and co-operation\\nbetween researchers and farmers, so
      that science can respond to these\\nlocal needs and contexts. Through [participatory
      and learning\\napproaches](https://www.participatorymethods.org/page/about-participatory-methods){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ncan
      technical and local knowledge be combined in order to achieve\\nappropriate
      technologies.\\n\\n### The lower visibility of engaged scholarship in agriculture
      may lead to use of inappropriate technology\\n\\nHowever, research that is more
      engaged with users and more orientated\\ntowards application tends to be associated
      with lower academic\\nvisibility, because its publications are often not included
      in the\\nmainstream bibliographic databases.\\n\\n[Various\\nstudies](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/66409/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      shown that coverage of journals of agricultural sciences in\\nmainstream databases
      is lower than in the natural sciences, but well\\nabove the social sciences
      and the humanities. Yet the situation is much\\nworse in terms of the coverage
      of the Global South in the mainstream\\ndatabases. For example, [studies by
      Subbiah\\nArunachalam](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24106511.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      2001 showed that of the 10,000 publications by Indian researchers in\\nagricultural
      research, 78% were in Indian journals and 77% were not\\nindexed by Web of Science.
      Other studies have highlighted that crops\\nrelevant in the Global South also
      have a much lower coverage in Web of\\nScience (WoS), for example [the crop
      pearl\\nmillet](http://oar.icrisat.org/7945/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n[A
      study on rice\\nresearch](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3kf9d/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfound
      that coverage of publications in mainstream databases was 2 to\\n3-fold higher
      for the Global North. Similarly, the coverage of topics\\nrelevant to the Global
      North in WoS and Scopus was 2-3-fold higher than\\nthe topics more relevant
      in the Global South -- as illustrated in Figure\\n1 for the case of rice research.\\n\\nGiven
      that the mission of agricultural research institutes and councils\\nis to increase
      food security, reduce poverty and improve natural\\necosystems, knowledge communicated
      through a plurality of channels\\nshould be valued beyond mainstream international
      journals. This would\\ninclude, for example, publication formats such as those
      collected by FAO\\nin its [AGRIS database](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (based\\non national collection and analysis centres), which include coverage
      of\\nmore diverse document types (reports, policy briefs, etc.) in comparison\\nto
      citation index databases such as WoS or to abstracting and indexing\\ndatabases
      such as CAB Abstracts.\\n\\nThis lack of visibility has at least two downsides.
      First, universities\\nor research institutes conducting extension programmes
      or engaged\\nagricultural research have often come to be perceived as not doing\\nprestigious
      science -- as excellence has increasingly been defined\\naccording to publications
      in prestigious journals. As a result,\\nresearchers may feel motivated to study
      topics valued by 'top' journals,\\nwhich are mostly focused on topics in the
      Global North.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"image-full landscape\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Rafols_Figure1.png\\\"

      are more relevant for the Global North (such as\\nmolecular biology) have a

      without being indexed in databases and without good Academic\\nSearch Engine
      Optimization for Open Access content, valuable contextual\\nknowledge is harder
      to discover, making it challenging to retrieve or\\naccess it. In consequence,
      technical experts in agriculture in the\\nGlobal South are more likely to apply
      technologies which are\\ninappropriate in their countries. For instance, the
      crop varieties that\\nare available in WoS may not correspond to relevant varieties
      for a\\ntropical context, and information about the crops may be appropriate
      for\\nEurope but inappropriate in Brazil or India. Including more local\\nagricultural
      journals in bibliographic databases could help promote\\nlocal agricultural
      solutions, as researchers and practitioners would\\nhave access to a wider range
      of information and perspectives.\\n\\n[A recent\\nstudy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3886019){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
      that countries in Africa and Asia suffer a much higher loss of\\nproductivity
      in agriculture than countries in Europe and the Americas as\\na consequence
      of the use of inappropriate technologies, where the degree\\nof inappropriateness
      is estimated as the mismatch in the presence of\\ncrop-specific pests and pathogens
      (see Figure 2). This inappropriate use\\nof agricultural technologies is partly
      due to the lower amount of\\nresearch in topics and areas of interest of the
      Global South, but also\\npartly due to the challenges in locating and accessing
      contextualised\\nknowledge which already exists but is published in local venues\\n(journals,

      coverage of agriculture in bibliographic databases\\n\\nA [new\\npublication](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ninterestingly
      challenges the perception, created by the conventional use\\nof mainstream databases,
      that research is extremely concentrated in\\njournals and publications of the
      Global North. Analysing 25,671 journals\\nwith 5.8 million documents of the
      platform Open Journal System (OJS),\\nthey found that 80% of the publications
      originated in the Global South,\\nthat 85% are in diamond Open Access (no fee
      for authors nor readers) and\\nalmost half of them have more than one language.\\n\\nThe
      success of the OJS infrastructure in making possible access and\\nvisibility
      of knowledge from the Global South suggests that it is high\\ntime for the development
      of more comprehensive databases. This has been\\na concern in medical research
      and social science and humanities (SSH),\\nleading to the development of regional
      specialised databases such as\\n[Scielo](https://scielo.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on health) and\\n[Redalyc](https://www.redalyc.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (more on SSH). In\\nrecent years we have also witnessed the development of more\\ncomprehensive
      databases like [Open\\nAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Lens](https://www.lens.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWe have conducted
      a small study using the [MIAR portal of the\\n'Information Matrix for the Analysis
      of\\nJournals'](https://miar.ub.edu/idioma/en){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} of the\\nUniversity
      of Barcelona in order to make a rough estimate of the journal\\ncoverage of
      various databases (see detailed\\n[methodology](https://osf.io/fd9cv){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [journal\\ndata](https://osf.io/9hdgc){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}). As shown
      in Figure 3,\\nfrom a sample of 1662 journals from any country with ISSN related
      to\\nagriculture, we found that CAB Abstracts had the highest coverage with\\n805
      (48%) journals, 562 (34%) of Scopus, 435 (26%) of WoS and 550 (33%)\\nof Veterinary
      Sciences. In terms of regional coverage, CAB Abstracts and\\nVeterinary Sciences
      have a better and broader coverage in the Global\\nSouth in relative terms.\\n\\n<figure

      journals by the largest database specialised in\\nagriculture, CAB Abstracts,
      in comparison to WoS and Scopus. 46% of the\\njournals are not covered by any
      of these databases.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThese results have to be contrasted
      with new databases such as\\n*Dimensions* and *Open Alex* that index papers
      rather than journals.\\nHere we have made some estimations for *Dimensions*,
      which showed a\\ncoverage of about 1160 (70%) of journals. The coverage was
      high also in\\nthe Global South, with 46 (41%) of African journals, against
      a 28 (25%)\\nin CAB Abstracts. Only for a few countries, including Iran, Germany,\\nRomania
      or Cuba, was *Dimensions* coverage lower than *CAB Abstracts*.  \\n\\nThe downside
      of these new, more comprehensive databases (alongside with\\nthe Google Scholar
      Coverage) is the lack of inquiry of the publishing\\npractices of journals.
      We found that some of the journals included in\\nthe larger databases, but not
      present in the more traditional databases\\nsuch as CAB Abstracts, have a higher
      incidence of problematic or\\nquestionable editorial and review practices (here
      the term ['predatory'\\nis\\nunhelpful](https://www-ub-edu.translate.goog/blokdebid/es/content/ineficiencias-defectos-y-practicas-fraudulentas-en-la-comunicacion-cientifica-abriendo-el?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=wapp){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\n###
      Another bibliographic coverage is possible, and necessary\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      another bibliographic world is possible where knowledge\\nis more diverse and
      accessible -- and this is important for agricultural\\nresearch to be more visible
      and accessible in and from the Global South.\\nInfrastructures towards this
      transformation have to be developed to\\nenhance interoperability and cooperation.
      This is the case, for example,\\nof the analysis centres that feed the FAO\\\\'s
      [AGRIS information\\nsystem](https://agris.fao.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      including grey\\nliterature. While currently no single commercial bibliographic
      database\\nhas a good coverage of agriculture, a new generation of databases
      in\\nconjunction with metadata aggregators from open access repositories may\\nhelp
      fill this gap. This increase in diversity of journals comes at the\\ncost of
      having a larger greyscale of rigour in journal editorial\\npractices. This challenge
      could be overcome with catalogues of editorial\\npractices such as [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or\\n[Latindex](https://latindex.org/latindex/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and\\nplatforms
      such as [MIAR](https://miar.ub.edu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nIt is about
      time to create more comprehensive open infrastructures to\\nprovide visibility
      and accessibility of agricultural knowledge relevant\\nto many more contexts,
      particularly in the Global South, so that\\nknowledge of appropriate technologies
      can foster human development\\nacross all the world.\\n\\n**Acknowledgement:**

      "European and global science policy have been restructured around ''global\nchallenges''
      and ''research excellence'' to commit to societal impact. Our\ncurrent global
      challenges, including climate change, destruction of\nnature, and increasing
      global inequality, require critical interrogation\nof the contributions and
      consequences of science. In the process of\nunderstanding, resolving, and transforming
      global challenges we should\nbe attentive to what is at the core of science:
      the attribution of value\nto numerical or qualitative values such as counting,
      classifying and\nevaluating physical and societal phenomena. This also holds
      for the\npractice of governing science. Science policy articulates particular\nkinds
      of future (e.g. environmental or societal outcomes) that are\nconsidered either
      desirable or unattractive, and it ascribes particular\nroles and values to science
      in the making of these futures. This raises\nimportant questions about the values
      attributed to scientific expertise\nand policy making in relation to sustainable
      futures, and the role and\nagency of science and policy in shaping sustainable
      futures.\n\nIn an attempt to address these questions, we hosted [a two-day workshop\non
      13 and 14 June\n2023](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/workhop){target=\"_blank\"}
      as part\nof the\n[FluidKnowledge](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/){target=\"_blank\"}\nproject
      of Sarah de Rijcke. We gathered a variety of academics\nreflecting on doing
      science in times of climate breakdown. Participants\nsubmitted contributions
      that covered different topics including but not\nlimited to biodiversity modelling
      for sustainable financing, sustainable\nagriculture, deep sea mining and nature
      conservation. The variety of\ntopics provided different angles to reflect upon
      roles and practices at\nthe interface between science policy and scientific
      expertise, and how\nscientists position themselves in their research. Although
      many relevant\nconcepts were discussed for each contribution, we would like
      here to\nhighlight two common themes: Power and Plurality. Both concepts\nmaterialized
      in various forms and contexts and made the bridge between\nthe different contributions.
      The combination of Power and Plurality made\nus, during the workshop, reflect
      upon our own position as researchers.  \n\n### Power, Plurality, and the Position
      of the research(er)\n\nWe started the workshop with two contributions addressing
      climate and\nbiodiversity modelling. Power materializes in modelling practices
      when\nmodellers navigate the powerfulness of climate and biodiversity scenario\nmodels
      in shaping policies and futures. Biodiversity and climate models\nare often
      developed by scientific institutions to project biodiversity\nand climate patterns.
      However, their power extends beyond the scientific\ninstitutions when they are
      applied to, for example, inform\ndecision-making in sustainable financing or
      global policy-making. In\nthese translation processes from science to environmental\ndecision-making
      the political, social and ethical dimensions come into\nplay. The plurality
      of perspectives present in these dimensions are\n*not* integrated in the original
      models. Nevertheless, the models and\nthe knowledge models create *are* used
      in high level decision-making and\nserve therefore as a powerful tool that scientific
      institutions should\ntake into account in their model designs.\n\nWhen zooming
      out, we touched upon the powerful organizational forms of\nwhat is valued as
      ''useful science'', which is now dominated by the\n(Western) techno economic
      paradigms that steer green technology\ntransitions. A good example of the power
      of this paradigm is the demands\nit puts on governments, companies, and researchers
      to explore the deep\nseabed for minerals like cobalt to support a sustainable
      future. We\ntouched upon deep sea research that seem to be trapped into a power\ngrab,
      controlled by (inter)national governments and industry to generate\nknowledge
      on the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining useful for\ncompanies and policy-making
      at international levels. In relation to\nthat, the importance of disinterestedness
      of researchers in this space\nis highly valued by most actors involved. As a
      result, this means that\neyebrows are being raised when researchers cooperate
      with industry or,\nalternatively, when researchers tend to take radical views
      against deep\nsea mining. Is it, as scientists, justifiable to step away from
      the\nimportance of being detached and disinterested, and actively choose\nsides?\n\n###
      Whose side are we on?\n\n''Whose side are we on'' as researchers was vividly
      highlighted when\ndiscussing a contribution on the co-creation of knowledge
      for nature\nconservation in South Africa. The pressure put on scientists to
      engage\nwith the variety of social actors that work in South African nature\nparks
      stems from the belief that this would increase the effectiveness\nof implementing
      conservation policies and empower local communities.\nHowever, based on experiences
      with research projects on transfrontier\nwildlife management and private game
      farming, we discussed whether\nknowledge co-creation can also be counterproductive
      for empowering\nmarginalized communities. This could be the case when powerful
      actors\nlike non-profit organizations or wildlife managers try to silence\nmarginalized
      communities through discrediting researchers and\ndelegitimizing other types
      of knowledges and perspectives. Instead of\ndisengaging, detaching, and staying
      independent from these power\ndynamics, researchers might have to choose positions
      when engaging in\nthese types of socio-ecological issues.\n\nBy the end of a
      fruitful and constructive workshop discussion, we were\nleft with more questions
      than answers to reflect upon. The discussions\nand diversity of topics that
      were addressed in the context of doing\nscience in times of climate breakdown
      led us to reflect on who''s side we\nare on as researchers ourselves. This includes
      the question of what we\ncan potentially do (more of) or should stop doing within
      our research\nand beyond to address global challenges. What does it actually
      mean to\nbe a scientist in this world? Should we politicize science, take (very)\ncritical
      views on what is happening, stand up from the relatively\ncomfortable science
      studies armchair and dive in?\n\nWhat is next? All workshop participants will
      continue to write their own\ncontributions and reflect on these questions in
      the next year. The\ncurrent contributions will be further developed into a journal\ncollection
      or edited volume. We extend our warm thanks to all\nparticipants of the workshop:

      to sustainable futures, and the role and\\nagency of science and policy in shaping
      sustainable futures.\\n\\nIn an attempt to address these questions, we hosted
      [a two-day workshop\\non 13 and 14 June\\n2023](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/workhop){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      as part\\nof the\\n[FluidKnowledge](https://www.fluid-knowledge.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject
      of Sarah de Rijcke. We gathered a variety of academics\\nreflecting on doing
      science in times of climate breakdown. Participants\\nsubmitted contributions
      that covered different topics including but not\\nlimited to biodiversity modelling
      for sustainable financing, sustainable\\nagriculture, deep sea mining and nature
      conservation. The variety of\\ntopics provided different angles to reflect upon
      roles and practices at\\nthe interface between science policy and scientific
      expertise, and how\\nscientists position themselves in their research. Although
      many relevant\\nconcepts were discussed for each contribution, we would like
      here to\\nhighlight two common themes: Power and Plurality. Both concepts\\nmaterialized
      in various forms and contexts and made the bridge between\\nthe different contributions.
      The combination of Power and Plurality made\\nus, during the workshop, reflect
      upon our own position as researchers.  \\n\\n### Power, Plurality, and the Position
      of the research(er)\\n\\nWe started the workshop with two contributions addressing
      climate and\\nbiodiversity modelling. Power materializes in modelling practices
      when\\nmodellers navigate the powerfulness of climate and biodiversity scenario\\nmodels
      in shaping policies and futures. Biodiversity and climate models\\nare often
      developed by scientific institutions to project biodiversity\\nand climate patterns.
      However, their power extends beyond the scientific\\ninstitutions when they
      are applied to, for example, inform\\ndecision-making in sustainable financing
      or global policy-making. In\\nthese translation processes from science to environmental\\ndecision-making
      the political, social and ethical dimensions come into\\nplay. The plurality
      of perspectives present in these dimensions are\\n*not* integrated in the original
      models. Nevertheless, the models and\\nthe knowledge models create *are* used
      in high level decision-making and\\nserve therefore as a powerful tool that
      scientific institutions should\\ntake into account in their model designs.\\n\\nWhen
      zooming out, we touched upon the powerful organizational forms of\\nwhat is
      valued as 'useful science', which is now dominated by the\\n(Western) techno
      economic paradigms that steer green technology\\ntransitions. A good example
      of the power of this paradigm is the demands\\nit puts on governments, companies,
      and researchers to explore the deep\\nseabed for minerals like cobalt to support
      a sustainable future. We\\ntouched upon deep sea research that seem to be trapped
      into a power\\ngrab, controlled by (inter)national governments and industry
      to generate\\nknowledge on the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining useful
      for\\ncompanies and policy-making at international levels. In relation to\\nthat,
      the importance of disinterestedness of researchers in this space\\nis highly
      valued by most actors involved. As a result, this means that\\neyebrows are
      being raised when researchers cooperate with industry or,\\nalternatively, when
      researchers tend to take radical views against deep\\nsea mining. Is it, as
      scientists, justifiable to step away from the\\nimportance of being detached
      and disinterested, and actively choose\\nsides?\\n\\n### Whose side are we on?\\n\\n'Whose
      side are we on' as researchers was vividly highlighted when\\ndiscussing a contribution
      on the co-creation of knowledge for nature\\nconservation in South Africa. The
      pressure put on scientists to engage\\nwith the variety of social actors that
      work in South African nature\\nparks stems from the belief that this would increase
      the effectiveness\\nof implementing conservation policies and empower local
      communities.\\nHowever, based on experiences with research projects on transfrontier\\nwildlife
      management and private game farming, we discussed whether\\nknowledge co-creation
      can also be counterproductive for empowering\\nmarginalized communities. This
      could be the case when powerful actors\\nlike non-profit organizations or wildlife
      managers try to silence\\nmarginalized communities through discrediting researchers
      and\\ndelegitimizing other types of knowledges and perspectives. Instead of\\ndisengaging,
      detaching, and staying independent from these power\\ndynamics, researchers
      might have to choose positions when engaging in\\nthese types of socio-ecological
      issues.\\n\\nBy the end of a fruitful and constructive workshop discussion,
      we were\\nleft with more questions than answers to reflect upon. The discussions\\nand
      diversity of topics that were addressed in the context of doing\\nscience in
      times of climate breakdown led us to reflect on who's side we\\nare on as researchers
      ourselves. This includes the question of what we\\ncan potentially do (more
      of) or should stop doing within our research\\nand beyond to address global
      challenges. What does it actually mean to\\nbe a scientist in this world? Should
      we politicize science, take (very)\\ncritical views on what is happening, stand
      up from the relatively\\ncomfortable science studies armchair and dive in?\\n\\nWhat
      is next? All workshop participants will continue to write their own\\ncontributions
      and reflect on these questions in the next year. The\\ncurrent contributions
      will be further developed into a journal\\ncollection or edited volume. We extend
      our warm thanks to all\\nparticipants of the workshop: B\xE9atrice Cointe, Klaudia
      Prodani, Mandy de\\nWilde, Niki Vermeulen, Thomas Franssen, Jorrit Smit, Jackie
      Ashkin,\\nFrancesco Colona, Anne Urai, Esther Turnhout and Marja Spierenburg.\\n\\n*

      "El Leiden Ranking de Universidades 2023 ha sido publicado el 21 de junio\ndel
      presente a\u00f1o. Contiene 1411 universidades de todo el mundo,\nincluyendo
      58 de Am\u00e9rica Latina. Al abrir la p\u00e1gina para 2023\nencontramos [en
      un\nlistado](https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2023/list){target=\"_blank\"}\na
      la Universidad de S\u00e3o Paulo en la posici\u00f3n 12 y la Universidad\nNacional
      Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico en la 98. Pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 significan estas\nposiciones?
      En este post, explicamos los indicadores del Leiden Ranking,\n*lo que dicen*
      y a\u00fan m\u00e1s importante *lo que no dicen*.\n\n### \u00a1Hemos subido
      en el ranking!\n\nCuando un ranking se publica, es com\u00fan ver noticias acerca
      de tal o cual\nuniversidad que se ha colocado en una posici\u00f3n superior
      comparada al a\u00f1o\nanterior y que ahora se encuentra en el top 5, 10 o 100
      de cierta\nregi\u00f3n. La nueva posici\u00f3n es usada como una muestra irrefutable
      de la\nexcelencia de la instituci\u00f3n y del esfuerzo de sus empleados. Las\npreguntas
      que casi nadie hace son \u00bfde qu\u00e9 manera es la universidad\nn\u00famero
      30 mejor que la universidad 31? O, \u00bfqu\u00e9 tan diferente es la\nuniversidad
      30 en comparaci\u00f3n con la 29?\n\nMuchos rankings usan indicadores compuestos,
      esto quiere decir que toman\nvarias medidas como publicaciones cient\u00edficas,
      encuestas de estudiantes,\nn\u00famero de subvenciones y premios internacionales
      entre sus graduados;\nlos mezclan de acuerdo a una f\u00f3rmula interna y le
      dan una calificaci\u00f3n a\ncada instituci\u00f3n. De esta forma es dif\u00edcil
      saber de qu\u00e9 manera una\nuniversidad es \"mejor\" o \"peor\" que una universidad
      que est\u00e1 una\nposici\u00f3n arriba o abajo.\n\nEste modo de asignar valor
      a una instituci\u00f3n en comparaci\u00f3n a otras ha\nsido ampliamente criticado
      por usar indicadores arbitrarios, por\nequiparar aspectos dif\u00edciles de
      comparar entre s\u00ed, o por la falta de\ntransparencia en cuanto a los mecanismos
      para asignar valor. Por\nejemplo, una universidad que se estableci\u00f3 hace
      m\u00e1s de 130 a\u00f1os tendr\u00e1\nprobablemente m\u00e1s ganadores del
      premio Nobel que una universidad que se\nestableci\u00f3 hace 40 a\u00f1os.
      A pesar de ello, los listados jer\u00e1rquicos de\nlas \"mejores universidades
      del mundo\" siguen siendo publicados y usados\nampliamente, especialmente por
      las propias universidades y los medios de\ncomunicaci\u00f3n.\n\n### El Leiden
      Ranking\n\nEl Leiden Ranking no es un listado jer\u00e1rquico ni est\u00e1tico,
      sino que\nprovee indicadores cubriendo varias dimensiones del desempe\u00f1o
      de 1411\nuniversidades mundiales a partir de datos bibliom\u00e9tricos, es decir
      a\npartir de publicaciones cient\u00edficas. Las universidades que se han\nincluido
      en la \u00faltima edici\u00f3n, 2023, son aquellas que tienen un m\u00ednimo\nde
      800 publicaciones contadas de forma fraccional e indexadas en la Web\nof Science
      (WoS).\n\nEl ranking es publicado por el [Center for Science and Technologies\nStudies
      (CWTS)](http://www.cwts.nl){target=\"_blank\"} un centro de la\nUniversidad
      de Leiden en los Pa\u00edses Bajos, y se gu\u00eda por [10\n[principios]{.underline}](https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2q274){target=\"_blank\"}\npara
      el uso responsable de ranking de universidades.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"34713\" />\n</figure>\n\n### Perspectiva de listado\n\nA primera
      vista, el Leiden Ranking parece un ranking como cualquier otro\ndado que al
      abrir la p\u00e1gina encontramos un listado de universidades\nordenado de acuerdo
      a cierto criterio de impacto cient\u00edfico: por defecto\nel n\u00famero de
      publicaciones (P) calculadas siguiendo el recuento\nfraccionario. Sin embargo,
      este no es un ordenamiento jer\u00e1rquico\nest\u00e1tico de universidades ya
      que de forma interactiva podemos ordenar el\nlistado bas\u00e1ndonos en la dimensi\u00f3n
      e indicador que estemos interesados,\nde entre las diferentes opciones que se
      ofrecen. De hecho, el ranking no\nes un listado sino una herramienta que permite
      explorar los indicadores\ndesde varias perspectivas. Adem\u00e1s, el listado
      inicial que aparece es una\nde las tres perspectivas que ofrece el sitio para
      explorar diferentes\ndimensiones e indicadores, las otras dos son por mapa o
      por gr\u00e1fico.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_2_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"34734\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n[[Perspectivas de gr\u00e1fico y en mapa]{.caption}]{.caption}\n\n###
      Diferentes dimensiones e indicadores\n\nA diferencia de otros rankings, el Leiden
      Ranking s\u00f3lo provee\ninformaci\u00f3n sobre los resultados de la investigaci\u00f3n
      cient\u00edfica a partir\nde publicaciones en revistas indexadas por la WoS.
      Este enfoque nos\npermite garantizar que los datos hayan sido recolectados y
      enriquecidos\ncon rigor, y que la metodolog\u00eda usada para el an\u00e1lisis
      sea transparente.\n\nLas diferentes dimensiones que se pueden explorar son:\n\n-
      Impacto cient\u00edfico -- basada en citas a las publicaciones de una\n  universidad.\n-
      Colaboraci\u00f3n -- basada en la colaboraci\u00f3n de una universidad con otras\n  organizaciones

      es mejor?\n\nEntonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 universidad es mejor? A partir de los
      datos del Leiden\nRanking, **no podemos hacer ese juicio de valor**. La mejor
      manera de\nusar el ranking es explorando las diferentes dimensiones y perspectivas,\nas\u00ed
      como la informaci\u00f3n detallada de cada universidad en espec\u00edfico.\nTodo
      ello sin perder de vista lo que se est\u00e1 midiendo: el desempe\u00f1o de\ninvestigaci\u00f3n
      cient\u00edfica a partir de publicaciones en una base de datos\nespec\u00edfica.\n\nComo
      se mencion\u00f3 anteriormente, el Leiden Ranking es una herramienta\ninteractiva
      que proporciona diferentes dimensiones e indicadores, no\nan\u00e1lisis completos.
      Estos indicadores pueden ser utilizados en conjunto\ncon otros indicadores y
      an\u00e1lisis para analizar el desempe\u00f1o de una\ninstituci\u00f3n a partir
      de estrategias espec\u00edficas.\n\nEl Leiden Ranking tiene, entre sus limitaciones,
      basarse en datos\npropietarios, los cuales no cubren muchos idiomas y que no
      son de Acceso\nAbierto. En CWTS somos conscientes de estas limitaciones, es
      por ello\nque apoyamos [More Than Our\nRank](https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/){target=\"_blank\"}**,**
      una\niniciativa de [INORMS](https://inorms.net){target=\"_blank\"}\n(International
      Network of Research Management Societies). La iniciativa\nbusca proveer a instituciones
      acad\u00e9micas \"una oportunidad para destacar\nlas muchas y variadas formas
      en que sirven al mundo, las cuales no est\u00e1n\nreflejadas en posiciones de
      rankings\". Los objetivos de **More Than our\nRank** se al\u00ednean perfectamente
      con nuestros principios de uso\nresponsable de rankings. Esperamos que muchas
      universidades y partes\ninteresadas se unan a esta iniciativa tan importante
      y necesaria.\n", "images": [{"src": "https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_1.png"},

      58 de Am\xE9rica Latina. Al abrir la p\xE1gina para 2023\\nencontramos [en un\\nlistado](https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2023/list){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\na
      la Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo en la posici\xF3n 12 y la Universidad\\nNacional
      Aut\xF3noma de M\xE9xico en la 98. Pero \xBFqu\xE9 significan estas\\nposiciones?
      En este post, explicamos los indicadores del Leiden Ranking,\\n*lo que dicen*
      y a\xFAn m\xE1s importante *lo que no dicen*.\\n\\n### \xA1Hemos subido en el
      ranking!\\n\\nCuando un ranking se publica, es com\xFAn ver noticias acerca
      de tal o cual\\nuniversidad que se ha colocado en una posici\xF3n superior comparada
      al a\xF1o\\nanterior y que ahora se encuentra en el top 5, 10 o 100 de cierta\\nregi\xF3n.
      La nueva posici\xF3n es usada como una muestra irrefutable de la\\nexcelencia
      de la instituci\xF3n y del esfuerzo de sus empleados. Las\\npreguntas que casi
      nadie hace son \xBFde qu\xE9 manera es la universidad\\nn\xFAmero 30 mejor que
      la universidad 31? O, \xBFqu\xE9 tan diferente es la\\nuniversidad 30 en comparaci\xF3n
      con la 29?\\n\\nMuchos rankings usan indicadores compuestos, esto quiere decir
      que toman\\nvarias medidas como publicaciones cient\xEDficas, encuestas de estudiantes,\\nn\xFAmero
      de subvenciones y premios internacionales entre sus graduados;\\nlos mezclan
      de acuerdo a una f\xF3rmula interna y le dan una calificaci\xF3n a\\ncada instituci\xF3n.
      De esta forma es dif\xEDcil saber de qu\xE9 manera una\\nuniversidad es \\\"mejor\\\"
      o \\\"peor\\\" que una universidad que est\xE1 una\\nposici\xF3n arriba o abajo.\\n\\nEste
      modo de asignar valor a una instituci\xF3n en comparaci\xF3n a otras ha\\nsido
      ampliamente criticado por usar indicadores arbitrarios, por\\nequiparar aspectos
      dif\xEDciles de comparar entre s\xED, o por la falta de\\ntransparencia en cuanto
      a los mecanismos para asignar valor. Por\\nejemplo, una universidad que se estableci\xF3
      hace m\xE1s de 130 a\xF1os tendr\xE1\\nprobablemente m\xE1s ganadores del premio
      Nobel que una universidad que se\\nestableci\xF3 hace 40 a\xF1os. A pesar de
      ello, los listados jer\xE1rquicos de\\nlas \\\"mejores universidades del mundo\\\"
      siguen siendo publicados y usados\\nampliamente, especialmente por las propias
      universidades y los medios de\\ncomunicaci\xF3n.\\n\\n### El Leiden Ranking\\n\\nEl
      Leiden Ranking no es un listado jer\xE1rquico ni est\xE1tico, sino que\\nprovee
      indicadores cubriendo varias dimensiones del desempe\xF1o de 1411\\nuniversidades
      mundiales a partir de datos bibliom\xE9tricos, es decir a\\npartir de publicaciones
      cient\xEDficas. Las universidades que se han\\nincluido en la \xFAltima edici\xF3n,
      2023, son aquellas que tienen un m\xEDnimo\\nde 800 publicaciones contadas de
      forma fraccional e indexadas en la Web\\nof Science (WoS).\\n\\nEl ranking es
      publicado por el [Center for Science and Technologies\\nStudies (CWTS)](http://www.cwts.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      un centro de la\\nUniversidad de Leiden en los Pa\xEDses Bajos, y se gu\xEDa

      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"34713\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Perspectiva de listado\\n\\nA
      primera vista, el Leiden Ranking parece un ranking como cualquier otro\\ndado
      que al abrir la p\xE1gina encontramos un listado de universidades\\nordenado
      de acuerdo a cierto criterio de impacto cient\xEDfico: por defecto\\nel n\xFAmero
      de publicaciones (P) calculadas siguiendo el recuento\\nfraccionario. Sin embargo,
      este no es un ordenamiento jer\xE1rquico\\nest\xE1tico de universidades ya que
      de forma interactiva podemos ordenar el\\nlistado bas\xE1ndonos en la dimensi\xF3n
      e indicador que estemos interesados,\\nde entre las diferentes opciones que
      se ofrecen. De hecho, el ranking no\\nes un listado sino una herramienta que
      permite explorar los indicadores\\ndesde varias perspectivas. Adem\xE1s, el
      listado inicial que aparece es una\\nde las tres perspectivas que ofrece el
      sitio para explorar diferentes\\ndimensiones e indicadores, las otras dos son
      por mapa o por gr\xE1fico.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_2_3.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34734\\\"

      Diferentes dimensiones e indicadores\\n\\nA diferencia de otros rankings, el
      Leiden Ranking s\xF3lo provee\\ninformaci\xF3n sobre los resultados de la investigaci\xF3n
      cient\xEDfica a partir\\nde publicaciones en revistas indexadas por la WoS.
      Este enfoque nos\\npermite garantizar que los datos hayan sido recolectados
      y enriquecidos\\ncon rigor, y que la metodolog\xEDa usada para el an\xE1lisis
      sea transparente.\\n\\nLas diferentes dimensiones que se pueden explorar son:\\n\\n-
      Impacto cient\xEDfico -- basada en citas a las publicaciones de una\\n  universidad.\\n-
      Colaboraci\xF3n -- basada en la colaboraci\xF3n de una universidad con otras\\n
      \ organizaciones y regiones.\\n- Acceso Abierto -- basada en las publicaciones
      en acceso abierto de\\n  diferentes tipos.\\n- G\xE9nero -- basada en el an\xE1lisis
      de g\xE9nero de los autores de las\\n  publicaciones.\\n\\nPor su parte, cada
      dimensi\xF3n se puede explorar a trav\xE9s de diferentes\\nindicadores como
      n\xFAmero total o porcentaje de publicaciones, distancias\\npara la colaboraci\xF3n
      y tipos de Acceso Abierto. En la p\xE1gina de\\n[indicadores](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nse
      encuentra una explicaci\xF3n m\xE1s detallada de cada uno de ellos (en\\ningl\xE9s).\\n\\nAdem\xE1s
      de las dimensiones y sus indicadores, el usuario puede crear su\\npropio ranking
      seleccionando un periodo, disciplina, regi\xF3n y n\xFAmero\\nm\xEDnimo de publicaciones.
      Por \xFAltimo, los indicadores de impacto\\ncient\xEDfico se pueden calcular
      utilizando un m\xE9todo de recuento total o\\nfraccionario. El m\xE9todo de
      recuento completo otorga un peso total de 1 a\\ncada publicaci\xF3n de una universidad.
      El m\xE9todo de recuento fraccionado\\nda menos peso a las publicaciones colaborativas
      que a las no\\ncolaborativas.\\n\\n**La Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo y la Universidad
      Nacional Aut\xF3noma de\\nM\xE9xico**\\n\\nEn la edici\xF3n del 2023 encontramos
      a la Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo (USP) y\\na la Universidad Nacional Aut\xF3noma
      de M\xE9xico (UNAM), entre muchas otras\\nde Am\xE9rica Latina. Al ver la vista
      est\xE1ndar en el listado parece que USP\\nest\xE1 en 86 posiciones m\xE1s arriba
      que la UNAM. Si nos fijamos en las\\nopciones veremos que se trata del periodo

      Leiden Ranking de Universidades 2023 ha sido publicado el 21 de junio\\ndel
      presente a\xF1o. Contiene 1411 universidades de todo el mundo,\\nincluyendo
      58 de Am\xE9rica Latina. Al abrir la p\xE1gina para 2023\\nencontramos [en un\\nlistado](https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2023/list){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\na
      la Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo en la posici\xF3n 12 y la Universidad\\nNacional
      Aut\xF3noma de M\xE9xico en la 98. Pero \xBFqu\xE9 significan estas\\nposiciones?
      En este post, explicamos los indicadores del Leiden Ranking,\\n*lo que dicen*
      y a\xFAn m\xE1s importante *lo que no dicen*.\\n\\n### \xA1Hemos subido en el
      ranking!\\n\\nCuando un ranking se publica, es com\xFAn ver noticias acerca
      de tal o cual\\nuniversidad que se ha colocado en una posici\xF3n superior comparada
      al a\xF1o\\nanterior y que ahora se encuentra en el top 5, 10 o 100 de cierta\\nregi\xF3n.
      La nueva posici\xF3n es usada como una muestra irrefutable de la\\nexcelencia
      de la instituci\xF3n y del esfuerzo de sus empleados. Las\\npreguntas que casi
      nadie hace son \xBFde qu\xE9 manera es la universidad\\nn\xFAmero 30 mejor que
      la universidad 31? O, \xBFqu\xE9 tan diferente es la\\nuniversidad 30 en comparaci\xF3n
      con la 29?\\n\\nMuchos rankings usan indicadores compuestos, esto quiere decir
      que toman\\nvarias medidas como publicaciones cient\xEDficas, encuestas de estudiantes,\\nn\xFAmero
      de subvenciones y premios internacionales entre sus graduados;\\nlos mezclan
      de acuerdo a una f\xF3rmula interna y le dan una calificaci\xF3n a\\ncada instituci\xF3n.
      De esta forma es dif\xEDcil saber de qu\xE9 manera una\\nuniversidad es \\\"mejor\\\"
      o \\\"peor\\\" que una universidad que est\xE1 una\\nposici\xF3n arriba o abajo.\\n\\nEste
      modo de asignar valor a una instituci\xF3n en comparaci\xF3n a otras ha\\nsido
      ampliamente criticado por usar indicadores arbitrarios, por\\nequiparar aspectos
      dif\xEDciles de comparar entre s\xED, o por la falta de\\ntransparencia en cuanto
      a los mecanismos para asignar valor. Por\\nejemplo, una universidad que se estableci\xF3
      hace m\xE1s de 130 a\xF1os tendr\xE1\\nprobablemente m\xE1s ganadores del premio
      Nobel que una universidad que se\\nestableci\xF3 hace 40 a\xF1os. A pesar de
      ello, los listados jer\xE1rquicos de\\nlas \\\"mejores universidades del mundo\\\"
      siguen siendo publicados y usados\\nampliamente, especialmente por las propias
      universidades y los medios de\\ncomunicaci\xF3n.\\n\\n### El Leiden Ranking\\n\\nEl
      Leiden Ranking no es un listado jer\xE1rquico ni est\xE1tico, sino que\\nprovee
      indicadores cubriendo varias dimensiones del desempe\xF1o de 1411\\nuniversidades
      mundiales a partir de datos bibliom\xE9tricos, es decir a\\npartir de publicaciones
      cient\xEDficas. Las universidades que se han\\nincluido en la \xFAltima edici\xF3n,
      2023, son aquellas que tienen un m\xEDnimo\\nde 800 publicaciones contadas de
      forma fraccional e indexadas en la Web\\nof Science (WoS).\\n\\nEl ranking es
      publicado por el [Center for Science and Technologies\\nStudies (CWTS)](http://www.cwts.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      un centro de la\\nUniversidad de Leiden en los Pa\xEDses Bajos, y se gu\xEDa
      por [10\\n[principios]{.underline}](https://www.cwts.nl/blog?article=n-r2q274){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\npara
      el uso responsable de ranking de universidades.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_1.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:
      1;\\\" data-image=\\\"34713\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Perspectiva de listado\\n\\nA
      primera vista, el Leiden Ranking parece un ranking como cualquier otro\\ndado
      que al abrir la p\xE1gina encontramos un listado de universidades\\nordenado
      de acuerdo a cierto criterio de impacto cient\xEDfico: por defecto\\nel n\xFAmero
      de publicaciones (P) calculadas siguiendo el recuento\\nfraccionario. Sin embargo,
      este no es un ordenamiento jer\xE1rquico\\nest\xE1tico de universidades ya que
      de forma interactiva podemos ordenar el\\nlistado bas\xE1ndonos en la dimensi\xF3n
      e indicador que estemos interesados,\\nde entre las diferentes opciones que
      se ofrecen. De hecho, el ranking no\\nes un listado sino una herramienta que
      permite explorar los indicadores\\ndesde varias perspectivas. Adem\xE1s, el
      listado inicial que aparece es una\\nde las tres perspectivas que ofrece el
      sitio para explorar diferentes\\ndimensiones e indicadores, las otras dos son
      por mapa o por gr\xE1fico.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/LR2023_Spanish_2_3.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34734\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n[[Perspectivas de gr\xE1fico y en mapa]{.caption}]{.caption}\\n\\n###
      Diferentes dimensiones e indicadores\\n\\nA diferencia de otros rankings, el
      Leiden Ranking s\xF3lo provee\\ninformaci\xF3n sobre los resultados de la investigaci\xF3n
      cient\xEDfica a partir\\nde publicaciones en revistas indexadas por la WoS.
      Este enfoque nos\\npermite garantizar que los datos hayan sido recolectados
      y enriquecidos\\ncon rigor, y que la metodolog\xEDa usada para el an\xE1lisis
      sea transparente.\\n\\nLas diferentes dimensiones que se pueden explorar son:\\n\\n-
      Impacto cient\xEDfico -- basada en citas a las publicaciones de una\\n  universidad.\\n-
      Colaboraci\xF3n -- basada en la colaboraci\xF3n de una universidad con otras\\n
      \ organizaciones y regiones.\\n- Acceso Abierto -- basada en las publicaciones
      en acceso abierto de\\n  diferentes tipos.\\n- G\xE9nero -- basada en el an\xE1lisis
      de g\xE9nero de los autores de las\\n  publicaciones.\\n\\nPor su parte, cada
      dimensi\xF3n se puede explorar a trav\xE9s de diferentes\\nindicadores como
      n\xFAmero total o porcentaje de publicaciones, distancias\\npara la colaboraci\xF3n
      y tipos de Acceso Abierto. En la p\xE1gina de\\n[indicadores](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/indicators){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nse
      encuentra una explicaci\xF3n m\xE1s detallada de cada uno de ellos (en\\ningl\xE9s).\\n\\nAdem\xE1s
      de las dimensiones y sus indicadores, el usuario puede crear su\\npropio ranking
      seleccionando un periodo, disciplina, regi\xF3n y n\xFAmero\\nm\xEDnimo de publicaciones.
      Por \xFAltimo, los indicadores de impacto\\ncient\xEDfico se pueden calcular
      utilizando un m\xE9todo de recuento total o\\nfraccionario. El m\xE9todo de
      recuento completo otorga un peso total de 1 a\\ncada publicaci\xF3n de una universidad.
      El m\xE9todo de recuento fraccionado\\nda menos peso a las publicaciones colaborativas
      que a las no\\ncolaborativas.\\n\\n**La Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo y la Universidad
      Nacional Aut\xF3noma de\\nM\xE9xico**\\n\\nEn la edici\xF3n del 2023 encontramos
      a la Universidad de S\xE3o Paulo (USP) y\\na la Universidad Nacional Aut\xF3noma
      de M\xE9xico (UNAM), entre muchas otras\\nde Am\xE9rica Latina. Al ver la vista
      est\xE1ndar en el listado parece que USP\\nest\xE1 en 86 posiciones m\xE1s arriba
      que la UNAM. Si nos fijamos en las\\nopciones veremos que se trata del periodo
      2018-2021, para todas las\\ndisciplinas, en todo el mundo, con un m\xEDnimo
      de publicaciones en 100,\\ndimensi\xF3n impacto cient\xEDfico, ordenado por
      n\xFAmero total de publicaciones\\n(recuento fraccionado). Si cambiamos las
      opciones, las posiciones\\ncambiar\xEDan. A continuaci\xF3n, presentamos algunos

      of universities in the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      keeps\nincreasing. Like in the last three editions of the ranking, a university\nneeds
      to have at least 800 fractionally counted publications in the most\nrecent four-year
      time window to be included in the ranking. This year\n1411 universities meet
      this criterion, 93 more than last year and 235\nmore than in 2020.\n\n<figure

      Gadjah Mada, and University of Indonesia),\nCameroon (University of Yaound\u00e9
      I), and Kazakhstan (Nazarbayev\nUniversity).\n\n### **More Than Our Rank**\n\nAt
      CWTS we are strongly committed to promoting responsible uses of\nuniversity
      rankings. Almost 20 years ago, our former director Ton van\nRaan was one of
      the first experts expressing concerns about the [fatal\nattraction of rankings
      of\nuniversities](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\"_blank\"}.\nBy
      creating the Leiden Ranking and contributing to\n[U-Multirank](https://www.umultirank.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      we have\nintroduced alternatives to simplistic one-dimensional rankings. We
      have\nalso developed [ten\nprinciples](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\"_blank\"}\nto
      guide the responsible use of university rankings.\n\nBuilding on this longstanding
      commitment to responsible uses of\nuniversity rankings, we are proud to be one
      of the initial supporters of\n[More Than Our\nRank](https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/){target=\"_blank\"},
      an\ninitiative launched in October 2022 by the International Network of\nResearch
      Management Societies (INORMS). By providing \"an opportunity for\nacademic institutions
      to highlight the many and various ways they serve\nthe world that are not reflected
      in their ranking position\", More Than\nOur Rank is fully aligned with our principles
      for ranking universities\nresponsibly (see Figure 3). We hope that many universities
      and other\nstakeholders will join this important initiative.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/u8y6uGPEPZ6jxaoHijGPDnUBIrkc_cKzLTofrjETqHH3Xr2irg6Fwiy1LFGEJojuGx4RouZrz-il3et2-erVqMJVzr3Uo7vrhgIjguB9FhyXhBQECbVZvMOqNrmE5gFWRMMjI57JHcNvFjRi\"\ndata-image=\"g2r6pu881p98\"

      presentation</a>.)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### **What''s next - Making the
      Leiden Ranking more transparent**\n\nBeing as transparent as possible is one
      of [our principles for\nresponsible university\nranking](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWhile
      the Leiden Ranking offers methodological transparency by\n[documenting its\nmethods](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/general){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      considerable detail, the [Web of Science\ndata](https://clarivate.com/products/webofscience/){target=\"_blank\"}
      on\nwhich the ranking is based (made available to us by Clarivate, the owner\nof
      Web of Science) is of a proprietary nature and cannot be shared\nopenly. This
      limits the [transparency and\nreproducibility](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      the Leiden Ranking. It is also in tension with the growing\nrecognition of the
      importance of \"independence and transparency of the\ndata, infrastructure and
      criteria necessary for research assessment and\nfor determining research impacts\"
      (one of the principles of the\n[Agreement on Reforming Research\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\nIn
      the [new strategic plan of\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nopenness
      of research information is a top priority. Open data sources\nsuch as [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"} offer exciting\nopportunities
      to produce bibliometric analytics in a fully transparent\nand reproducible way.
      We are currently working on an ambitious project\nin which we explore the use
      of open data sources to create a fully\ntransparent and reproducible version
      of the Leiden Ranking. We expect to\nshare the outcomes of this project later
      this year.\n\n### **Let us know your feedback and ideas**\n\nAs always, we appreciate
      your feedback on the Leiden Ranking and your\nideas on ways to improve the ranking.

      countries previously not represented now also have universities in\\nthe Leiden

      Gadjah Mada, and University of Indonesia),\\nCameroon (University of Yaound\xE9
      I), and Kazakhstan (Nazarbayev\\nUniversity).\\n\\n### **More Than Our Rank**\\n\\nAt
      CWTS we are strongly committed to promoting responsible uses of\\nuniversity
      rankings. Almost 20 years ago, our former director Ton van\\nRaan was one of
      the first experts expressing concerns about the [fatal\\nattraction of rankings
      of\\nuniversities](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0008-6){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nBy
      creating the Leiden Ranking and contributing to\\n[U-Multirank](https://www.umultirank.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we have\\nintroduced alternatives to simplistic one-dimensional rankings. We
      have\\nalso developed [ten\\nprinciples](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      guide the responsible use of university rankings.\\n\\nBuilding on this longstanding
      commitment to responsible uses of\\nuniversity rankings, we are proud to be
      one of the initial supporters of\\n[More Than Our\\nRank](https://inorms.net/more-than-our-rank/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      an\\ninitiative launched in October 2022 by the International Network of\\nResearch
      Management Societies (INORMS). By providing \\\"an opportunity for\\nacademic
      institutions to highlight the many and various ways they serve\\nthe world that
      are not reflected in their ranking position\\\", More Than\\nOur Rank is fully
      aligned with our principles for ranking universities\\nresponsibly (see Figure
      3). We hope that many universities and other\\nstakeholders will join this important
      initiative.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/u8y6uGPEPZ6jxaoHijGPDnUBIrkc_cKzLTofrjETqHH3Xr2irg6Fwiy1LFGEJojuGx4RouZrz-il3et2-erVqMJVzr3Uo7vrhgIjguB9FhyXhBQECbVZvMOqNrmE5gFWRMMjI57JHcNvFjRi\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"g2r6pu881p98\\\"

      presentation</a>.)</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n### **What's next - Making
      the Leiden Ranking more transparent**\\n\\nBeing as transparent as possible
      is one of [our principles for\\nresponsible university\\nranking](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/responsibleuse){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nWhile
      the Leiden Ranking offers methodological transparency by\\n[documenting its\\nmethods](https://www.leidenranking.com/information/general){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      considerable detail, the [Web of Science\\ndata](https://clarivate.com/products/webofscience/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      on\\nwhich the ranking is based (made available to us by Clarivate, the owner\\nof
      Web of Science) is of a proprietary nature and cannot be shared\\nopenly. This
      limits the [transparency and\\nreproducibility](https://arma.ac.uk/rethinking-the-rankings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      the Leiden Ranking. It is also in tension with the growing\\nrecognition of
      the importance of \\\"independence and transparency of the\\ndata, infrastructure
      and criteria necessary for research assessment and\\nfor determining research
      impacts\\\" (one of the principles of the\\n[Agreement on Reforming Research\\nAssessment](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nIn
      the [new strategic plan of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nopenness
      of research information is a top priority. Open data sources\\nsuch as [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} offer exciting\\nopportunities
      to produce bibliometric analytics in a fully transparent\\nand reproducible
      way. We are currently working on an ambitious project\\nin which we explore
      the use of open data sources to create a fully\\ntransparent and reproducible
      version of the Leiden Ranking. We expect to\\nshare the outcomes of this project
      later this year.\\n\\n### **Let us know your feedback and ideas**\\n\\nAs always,
      we appreciate your feedback on the Leiden Ranking and your\\nideas on ways to
      improve the ranking. Don't hesitate to [reach\\nout](https://www.leidenranking.com/contact){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\n\\n

      versions. Persistent identifiers are the\nsignposts along this road. Funders

      a publishing avenue, from preprint publishing to open peer\\nreview to dissemination
      via a diamond or overlay journal, facilitating\\nfurther dialogue and revised

      introduced the CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028. Building on this, in\nthe current
      post we present the new focal areas in which CWTS organizes\nits activities.
      These focal areas address key challenges in the way\nscience is practiced and
      governed, in particular challenges for which we\nbelieve our centre is uniquely
      positioned to make a difference and to\ncontribute to transformative changes.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-focal-areas-of-CWTS.png\"\ndata-image=\"34092\"
      alt=\"The focal areas of CWTS\" />\n</figure>\n\n### Focal areas\n\nMost of
      our activities at CWTS take place in three focal areas:\nEngagement & Inclusion,
      Evaluation & Culture, and Information &\nOpenness. These focal areas were launched
      on January 1, 2023, replacing\nthe three research groups in which CWTS was organized
      until the end of\n2022. While the research groups represented disciplinary traditions
      in\nscience studies research, the focal areas are organized around key\nchallenges
      faced by the research system. This reflects a major shift in\nour way of working
      at CWTS.\n\nEach focal area consists of a core group of about eight to ten senior\nstaff
      members and a broader group of PhD candidates and other\nearly-career staff
      members as well as visiting researchers. A focal area\nhas a small coordinating
      team that includes both senior researchers and\na colleague with expertise in
      project coordination. To benefit from\nsynergies between the focal areas, several
      staff members are\ncontributing to two areas.\n\nThe box below summarizes the
      topics addressed by the focal areas. While\neach focal area covers a distinct
      set of problems, the areas are also\nclosely interconnected. The selection of
      the topics addressed by the\nfocal areas is the outcome of an intensive consultative
      process\ninvolving the entire CWTS team. By focusing on these topics, we aim
      to\nset clear priorities and to maximize the impact of our work. The\nimportance
      of setting priorities was emphasized in the evaluation of our\ncentre that took
      place last year. In its advice, the evaluation\ncommittee also identified topics
      that it felt may deserve more attention\nin the work of our centre. The suggestions
      made by the committee have\nproven very useful in defining the focal areas.  \n\n:::
      {style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3; padding:10px;\"}\n#### Engagement & Inclusion
      {#engagement-inclusion style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"}\n\nThe focal
      area *Engagement & Inclusion* aims to contribute to a more\ncollaborative, engaged,
      and inclusive research system. We believe in\npromoting diversity and inclusion
      in the global scientific workforce,\nand in recognizing the essential role that
      communication and co-creation\nof scholarly activities play in strengthening
      such a diverse system. The\nfocal area approaches these questions through strategic
      ambitions around\nthe three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda: *understanding*,\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing*. Examples of such ambitions include\nimproving our understanding
      of the role of epistemic diversity in\nknowledge creation, developing policy
      recommendations for more inclusive\nand diverse academic careers, and taking
      more proactive measures to\nco-create our own activities with a larger variety
      of societal\nstakeholders (e.g., NGOs, educational organizations, and citizens).\n\n####
      Evaluation & Culture {#evaluation-culture style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"}\n\nThe
      focal area *Evaluation & Culture* is concerned with the many\ndifferent ways
      in which research is evaluated, for instance through\nassessment of research
      institutions and individual researchers, and\nthrough peer review in publishing
      and funding contexts. Recognizing the\nmutual shaping of research and research
      evaluation, we are committed to\npromoting forms of evaluation that are suited
      to diverse knowledge\nmaking practices and that foster healthy and inclusive
      academic working\nenvironments. The focal area combines activities in the *understanding*,\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We\nwant to better understand
      how research evaluation in its many forms\nconditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and daily practices of\nresearch and scholarly communication. In
      addition, we aim to use our\ninsights to promote positive change, for example
      by advising\ninstitutions like universities and funding bodies on how to organize\nevaluation
      for epistemic and social inclusivity, diversity, and\nopenness. Lastly, we aim
      to practice our values by constantly reflecting\non how we do evaluation in
      our immediate working environment.\n\n#### Information & Openness {#information-openness
      style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"}\n\nThe focal area *Information & Openness*
      is concerned with studying and\nadvancing openness of research information,
      such as information about\nthe activities and outputs of researchers and research
      institutions. We\nbelieve that openness of research information can play an
      important role\nin fostering responsible research assessment practices and promoting\nglobal
      inclusiveness in science. The activities of the focal area\nrevolve around the
      *understanding*, *intervening*, and *practicing*\npillars of the CWTS knowledge
      agenda. We aim to develop a deep\nunderstanding of the open research information
      landscape and to monitor\nthe openness of research information. We also intend
      to develop\ninitiatives that promote openness of research information as the
      norm\nfor scientometric analyses. In addition, we are putting the use of open\nresearch
      information into practice in our own work. The work of CWTS\nwill increasingly
      be based on open rather than closed research\ninformation, making our work more
      transparent, reproducible, and\ninclusive.\n:::\n\n### Strategic ambitions\n\nThe
      focal areas are currently developing strategic ambitions for the\nperiod 2023-2028.
      Each focal area organizes its strategic ambitions in\nthree pillars:\n\n- ***Understanding:***
      Ambitions that focus on developing a deeper\n  understanding of the problems
      addressed in the focal area.\n\n- ***Intervening:*** Ambitions that contribute
      to improving the research\n  system, for instance through Horizon Europe projects,
      products and\n  services of [CWTS BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\"_blank\"},
      and\n  also through training, advocacy, and contributions to policy making.\n\n-
      ***Practicing:*** Ambitions that contribute to improving our own way\n  of working
      at CWTS (''practice what we preach'').\n\nWhile a research centre may traditionally
      be expected to focus primarily\non *understanding*, for our centre\u00a0*intervening*
      is of equal importance.\nAs discussed in [our previous blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028),\nthe
      mission of CWTS is to improve how science is practiced and governed\nand how
      it serves society. Realizing this mission requires us to invest\nour efforts
      both in *understanding* and in *intervening*. In addition,\nrecognizing that
      we are part of the research system ourselves, we also\nfeel a special responsibility
      to improve our own way of working by\n*practicing* what we preach, for instance
      in areas such as [open\nscience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/practicing-what-we-preach-our-journey-toward-open-science)\nand
      [recognition and\nrewards](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts).\n\nAt
      the moment the focal areas are working hard to finalize the\ndevelopment of
      their strategic ambitions in the *understanding*,\n*intervening*, and *practicing*
      pillars. They expect to announce their\nplans in the coming months.  \n\n###
      Next steps\n\nThe focal areas, along with new ambitions in the *understanding*,\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars, represent a major change in our\nway of working at
      CWTS. The full implementation of these key elements in\nthe CWTS knowledge agenda
      2023-2028 will take time. We therefore see\n2023 and 2024 as a transition period
      in which the knowledge agenda will\nbe further elaborated and fine-tuned and
      in which the introduction of a\nnew way of working at our centre will be completed.\n\nWe
      expect that the Leiden Madtrics blog will be used to provide further\nupdates
      on the development of the knowledge agenda and the focal areas.\nKeep an eye
      on future blog posts!\n\n*We thank the focal area coordinators for preparing
      the brief\ndescriptions of the focal areas presented in this blog post.*  \n",

      of such ambitions include\\nimproving our understanding of the role of epistemic
      diversity in\\nknowledge creation, developing policy recommendations for more
      inclusive\\nand diverse academic careers, and taking more proactive measures
      to\\nco-create our own activities with a larger variety of societal\\nstakeholders
      (e.g., NGOs, educational organizations, and citizens).\\n\\n#### Evaluation
      & Culture {#evaluation-culture style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      focal area *Evaluation & Culture* is concerned with the many\\ndifferent ways
      in which research is evaluated, for instance through\\nassessment of research
      institutions and individual researchers, and\\nthrough peer review in publishing
      and funding contexts. Recognizing the\\nmutual shaping of research and research
      evaluation, we are committed to\\npromoting forms of evaluation that are suited
      to diverse knowledge\\nmaking practices and that foster healthy and inclusive
      academic working\\nenvironments. The focal area combines activities in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We\\nwant to better understand
      how research evaluation in its many forms\\nconditions research agendas, notions
      of quality, and daily practices of\\nresearch and scholarly communication. In
      addition, we aim to use our\\ninsights to promote positive change, for example
      by advising\\ninstitutions like universities and funding bodies on how to organize\\nevaluation
      for epistemic and social inclusivity, diversity, and\\nopenness. Lastly, we
      aim to practice our values by constantly reflecting\\non how we do evaluation
      in our immediate working environment.\\n\\n#### Information & Openness {#information-openness
      style=\\\"width:100%; text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe focal area *Information
      & Openness* is concerned with studying and\\nadvancing openness of research
      information, such as information about\\nthe activities and outputs of researchers
      and research institutions. We\\nbelieve that openness of research information
      can play an important role\\nin fostering responsible research assessment practices
      and promoting\\nglobal inclusiveness in science. The activities of the focal
      area\\nrevolve around the *understanding*, *intervening*, and *practicing*\\npillars
      of the CWTS knowledge agenda. We aim to develop a deep\\nunderstanding of the
      open research information landscape and to monitor\\nthe openness of research
      information. We also intend to develop\\ninitiatives that promote openness of
      research information as the norm\\nfor scientometric analyses. In addition,
      we are putting the use of open\\nresearch information into practice in our own
      work. The work of CWTS\\nwill increasingly be based on open rather than closed
      research\\ninformation, making our work more transparent, reproducible, and\\ninclusive.\\n:::\\n\\n###
      Strategic ambitions\\n\\nThe focal areas are currently developing strategic
      ambitions for the\\nperiod 2023-2028. Each focal area organizes its strategic
      ambitions in\\nthree pillars:\\n\\n- ***Understanding:*** Ambitions that focus
      on developing a deeper\\n  understanding of the problems addressed in the focal
      area.\\n\\n- ***Intervening:*** Ambitions that contribute to improving the research\\n
      \ system, for instance through Horizon Europe projects, products and\\n  services
      of [CWTS BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, and\\n  also through
      training, advocacy, and contributions to policy making.\\n\\n- ***Practicing:***
      Ambitions that contribute to improving our own way\\n  of working at CWTS ('practice
      what we preach').\\n\\nWhile a research centre may traditionally be expected
      to focus primarily\\non *understanding*, for our centre\_*intervening* is of
      equal importance.\\nAs discussed in [our previous blog\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028),\\nthe
      mission of CWTS is to improve how science is practiced and governed\\nand how
      it serves society. Realizing this mission requires us to invest\\nour efforts
      both in *understanding* and in *intervening*. In addition,\\nrecognizing that
      we are part of the research system ourselves, we also\\nfeel a special responsibility
      to improve our own way of working by\\n*practicing* what we preach, for instance
      in areas such as [open\\nscience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/practicing-what-we-preach-our-journey-toward-open-science)\\nand
      [recognition and\\nrewards](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts).\\n\\nAt
      the moment the focal areas are working hard to finalize the\\ndevelopment of
      their strategic ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*, and *practicing*
      pillars. They expect to announce their\\nplans in the coming months.  \\n\\n###
      Next steps\\n\\nThe focal areas, along with new ambitions in the *understanding*,\\n*intervening*,
      and *practicing* pillars, represent a major change in our\\nway of working at
      CWTS. The full implementation of these key elements in\\nthe CWTS knowledge
      agenda 2023-2028 will take time. We therefore see\\n2023 and 2024 as a transition
      period in which the knowledge agenda will\\nbe further elaborated and fine-tuned

      introduced the CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028. Building on this, in\\nthe current
      post we present the new focal areas in which CWTS organizes\\nits activities.
      These focal areas address key challenges in the way\\nscience is practiced and
      governed, in particular challenges for which we\\nbelieve our centre is uniquely
      positioned to make a difference and to\\ncontribute to transformative changes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-focal-areas-of-CWTS.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"34092\\\"
      alt=\\\"The focal areas of CWTS\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Focal areas\\n\\nMost
      of our activities at CWTS take place in three focal areas:\\nEngagement & Inclusion,
      Evaluation & Culture, and Information &\\nOpenness. These focal areas were launched
      on January 1, 2023, replacing\\nthe three research groups in which CWTS was
      organized until the end of\\n2022. While the research groups represented disciplinary
      traditions in\\nscience studies research, the focal areas are organized around
      key\\nchallenges faced by the research system. This reflects a major shift in\\nour
      way of working at CWTS.\\n\\nEach focal area consists of a core group of about
      eight to ten senior\\nstaff members and a broader group of PhD candidates and
      other\\nearly-career staff members as well as visiting researchers. A focal
      area\\nhas a small coordinating team that includes both senior researchers and\\na
      colleague with expertise in project coordination. To benefit from\\nsynergies
      between the focal areas, several staff members are\\ncontributing to two areas.\\n\\nThe
      box below summarizes the topics addressed by the focal areas. While\\neach focal
      area covers a distinct set of problems, the areas are also\\nclosely interconnected.
      The selection of the topics addressed by the\\nfocal areas is the outcome of
      an intensive consultative process\\ninvolving the entire CWTS team. By focusing
      on these topics, we aim to\\nset clear priorities and to maximize the impact
      of our work. The\\nimportance of setting priorities was emphasized in the evaluation
      of our\\ncentre that took place last year. In its advice, the evaluation\\ncommittee
      also identified topics that it felt may deserve more attention\\nin the work
      of our centre. The suggestions made by the committee have\\nproven very useful
      in defining the focal areas.  \\n\\n::: {style=\\\"background-color: #f3f3f3;
      padding:10px;\\\"}\\n#### Engagement & Inclusion {#engagement-inclusion style=\\\"width:100%;
      text-align:center;\\\"}\\n\\nThe focal area *Engagement & Inclusion* aims to
      contribute to a more\\ncollaborative, engaged, and inclusive research system.
      We believe in\\npromoting diversity and inclusion in the global scientific workforce,\\nand
      in recognizing the essential role that communication and co-creation\\nof scholarly
      activities play in strengthening such a diverse system. The\\nfocal area approaches
      these questions through strategic ambitions around\\nthe three pillars of the
      CWTS knowledge agenda: *understanding*,\\n*intervening*, and *practicing*. Examples
      of such ambitions include\\nimproving our understanding of the role of epistemic
      diversity in\\nknowledge creation, developing policy recommendations for more
      inclusive\\nand diverse academic careers, and taking more proactive measures
      to\\nco-create our own activities with a larger variety of societal\\nstakeholders

      "content_text": "Academic research has become increasingly complex, multidisciplinary,\ncollaborative,
      and transnational. The institutions that underpin\nresearch - including communication
      and evaluation systems - are trying\nto keep up, with varying levels of success.
      At the same time, our\nsociety is facing major challenges, including existential
      global health,\nwelfare, and sustainability issues. Obtaining solid evidence-informed\nsolutions
      to address these challenges requires a research system that\nencourages collaboration
      between researchers and with societal\nstakeholders, that values intellectual
      curiosity, outside-the-box\nthinking, and a diversity of perspectives, and that
      stimulates open\nsharing of results. It also requires a research system that
      reflects on\nits own role in society and its own shortcomings. This is the research\nsystem
      that we, at CWTS, want to help create.\n\nIn the coming six years, CWTS will
      operate under the heading of a new\nhigh-level strategic plan. In this blog
      post we share the purpose and\nmission of this new knowledge agenda. Our knowledge
      agenda replaces the\nresearch program [*Valuing Science and\nScholarship*](https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2q2x2.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      we have been working on between 2017 and 2022.  \n\n### Not another research
      program\n\nWhilst it is common for research institutes at Dutch universities
      to\nhave a *research program*, over the past years we began to feel the\nlimits
      of a framing that prioritizes research and leaves less room for\nother important
      activities. Instead, we wanted our new strategy to\nembrace all our activities,
      from our fundamental research to our tool\ndevelopment, and from our interventions
      in policy and education to our\nconsultancy and contract work. The term *knowledge
      agenda* is intended\nto communicate this inclusive ambition. It describes the
      mission we will\nwork on, the collective values we will uphold, and the strategic
      topics\nwe will address.  \n\n### Mission\n\nIn the lead-up to this new knowledge
      agenda, we spent a considerable\namount of time in 2022 discussing with the
      entire CWTS team the mission\nand values of our centre. We also organized two
      retreats that included\nbrainstorming sessions with academic partners and other
      stakeholders and\neven offered an opportunity to [develop dream\nprojects](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts).
      And\nfinally, we worked on defining focal areas for our institute and\ndeveloped
      a new organizational structure around these focal areas. We\nwill introduce
      these focal areas in a [next blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png\"\ndata-image=\"33918\"
      alt=\"Knowledge agenda\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \nTogether, we came up with the
      following mission statement for our\ncentre:\n\n*Our mission at CWTS is to improve
      how science is practiced and governed\nand how it serves society*\n\nTo realize
      this mission, we aim to develop a deep understanding of the\ndynamics of scientific
      knowledge production, based on in-depth\nengagement with a broad range of scientific
      and societal stakeholders.\nWe also aim to contribute to reforms in research
      assessment, adoption of\nopen science practices, changes in research cultures,
      and innovations in\nresearch analytics. Moreover, recognizing that we are part
      of the\nresearch system ourselves, we strive to practice what we preach and
      to\nlead by example.  \n\n### Values\n\nIn our new knowledge agenda, we are
      trying to adopt a [more explicitly\nvalue-led\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts)\nthat
      aims for congruence between the knowledge we create, our own\nresearch culture,
      and our internal governance mechanisms. The goal of\n''practicing what we preach''
      is to foster a positive culture at our\ncentre, not only stemming from our knowledge
      about the research system,\nbut also born from and carried by the CWTS community.
      To incorporate a\nmore active reflection on our own values into our strategy,
      we\ncollectively developed four core values to guide our work and\ndecision-making:  \n\n-
      *Transformative.* We want to make a difference by inciting\n  transformative
      changes in the way science is practiced and governed\n  and the way it serves
      society.\n\n- *Evidence-informed.* We value evidence-informed work and\n  policy-making.
      We collect scientific evidence and act on it, but we\n  also acknowledge its
      limitations. Scientific evidence offers essential\n  insights for improving
      how science is practiced and governed, but\n  these insights are always tentative
      and dependent on context.\n\n- *Collaborative.* We value collaborative work.
      To address the complex\n  challenges faced by science and society, we prefer
      to collaborate\n  rather than compete, both internally within our team and with
      external\n  stakeholders. We cherish a diversity of perspectives and strive
      for a\n  balanced representation and recognition of everyone''s interests and\n  contributions.\n\n-
      *Responsible.* We promote more responsible ways of practicing and\n  governing
      science, for instance by making research processes more\n  inclusive, research
      evaluations more fair, and research analytics more\n  transparent. We practice
      what we preach by making our own way of\n  working more responsible.\n\n###
      The coming years\n\nThe CWTS knowledge agenda 2023-2028 is intended to be an
      encompassing,\nhigh-level, and value-led strategic plan. It is meant to focus
      our\nefforts at a time when pushes for reform in research assessment and the\nincreased
      need for openness in research practices provide us with a\nunique opportunity
      to contribute to a stronger and healthier research\nsystem. Among other things,
      we plan to consider how research evaluation\nin its many forms conditions research
      agendas, notions of quality, and\ndaily practices of research and scholarly
      communication; how strategic\nand meaningful public engagement can become integral
      to realizing the\nvalue and relevance of academic research; how policy recommendations
      for\nmore inclusive and diverse academic careers can be developed; and how\nstructural
      inequities and lack of diversity and inclusion in global\nscience can be better
      understood and addressed. Tackling these and other\nquestions requires joint
      action by many different stakeholders in the\nresearch system. With our new
      knowledge agenda, we hope to meaningfully\ncontribute to this in the years to
      come.  \n", "images": [{"src": "https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png",

      research has become increasingly complex, multidisciplinary,\ncollaborative,
      and transnational. The institutions that underpin\nresearch - including communication
      and evaluation systems - are trying\nto keep up, with varying levels of success.
      At the same time, our\nsociety is facing major challenges, including existential
      global health,\nwelfare, and sustainability issues. Obtaining solid evidence-informed\nsolutions
      to address these challenges requires a research system that\nencourages collaboration
      between researchers and with societal\nstakeholders, that values intellectual
      curiosity, outside-the-box\nthinking, and a diversity of perspectives, and that
      stimulates open\nsharing of results. It also requires a research system that
      reflects on\nits own role in society and its own shortcomings. This is the research\nsystem
      that we, at CWTS, want to help create.\n\nIn the coming six years, CWTS will
      operate under the heading of a new\nhigh-level strategic plan. In this blog
      post we share the purpose and\nmission of this new knowledge agenda. Our knowledge
      agenda replaces the\nresearch program [*Valuing Science and\nScholarship*](https://www.cwts.nl/download/f-x2q2x2.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      we have been working on between 2017 and 2022.  \n\n### Not another research
      program\n\nWhilst it is common for research institutes at Dutch universities
      to\nhave a *research program*, over the past years we began to feel the\nlimits
      of a framing that prioritizes research and leaves less room for\nother important
      activities. Instead, we wanted our new strategy to\nembrace all our activities,
      from our fundamental research to our tool\ndevelopment, and from our interventions
      in policy and education to our\nconsultancy and contract work. The term *knowledge
      agenda* is intended\nto communicate this inclusive ambition. It describes the
      mission we will\nwork on, the collective values we will uphold, and the strategic
      topics\nwe will address.  \n\n### Mission\n\nIn the lead-up to this new knowledge
      agenda, we spent a considerable\namount of time in 2022 discussing with the
      entire CWTS team the mission\nand values of our centre. We also organized two
      retreats that included\nbrainstorming sessions with academic partners and other
      stakeholders and\neven offered an opportunity to [develop dream\nprojects](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts).
      And\nfinally, we worked on defining focal areas for our institute and\ndeveloped
      a new organizational structure around these focal areas. We\nwill introduce
      these focal areas in a [next blog\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20230509-knowledge-agenda.png\"\ndata-image=\"33918\"
      alt=\"Knowledge agenda\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \nTogether, we came up with the
      following mission statement for our\ncentre:\n\n*Our mission at CWTS is to improve
      how science is practiced and governed\nand how it serves society*\n\nTo realize
      this mission, we aim to develop a deep understanding of the\ndynamics of scientific
      knowledge production, based on in-depth\nengagement with a broad range of scientific
      and societal stakeholders.\nWe also aim to contribute to reforms in research
      assessment, adoption of\nopen science practices, changes in research cultures,
      and innovations in\nresearch analytics. Moreover, recognizing that we are part
      of the\nresearch system ourselves, we strive to practice what we preach and
      to\nlead by example.  \n\n### Values\n\nIn our new knowledge agenda, we are
      trying to adopt a [more explicitly\nvalue-led\nframework](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts)\nthat
      aims for congruence between the knowledge we create, our own\nresearch culture,
      and our internal governance mechanisms. The goal of\n''practicing what we preach''
      is to foster a positive culture at our\ncentre, not only stemming from our knowledge
      about the research system,\nbut also born from and carried by the CWTS community.
      To incorporate a\nmore active reflection on our own values into our strategy,
      we\ncollectively developed four core values to guide our work and\ndecision-making:  \n\n-
      *Transformative.* We want to make a difference by inciting\n  transformative
      changes in the way science is practiced and governed\n  and the way it serves
      society.\n\n- *Evidence-informed.* We value evidence-informed work and\n  policy-making.
      We collect scientific evidence and act on it, but we\n  also acknowledge its
      limitations. Scientific evidence offers essential\n  insights for improving
      how science is practiced and governed, but\n  these insights are always tentative
      and dependent on context.\n\n- *Collaborative.* We value collaborative work.
      To address the complex\n  challenges faced by science and society, we prefer
      to collaborate\n  rather than compete, both internally within our team and with
      external\n  stakeholders. We cherish a diversity of perspectives and strive
      for a\n  balanced representation and recognition of everyone''s interests and\n  contributions.\n\n-
      *Responsible.* We promote more responsible ways of practicing and\n  governing
      science, for instance by making research processes more\n  inclusive, research
      evaluations more fair, and research analytics more\n  transparent. We practice
      what we preach by making our own way of\n  working more responsible.\n\n###

      are under development. However, to empower further innovation\nin scholarly
      communication, a shared way to describe these different\nplatforms and their
      possibilities of interaction is required.  \n\n### The Journal Observatory project:
      aims and approach\n\nTo address this challenge, our project aims to:  \n\n1.  define
      an extensible, machine-readable and traceable way to describe\n    the policies
      and practices of the various platforms involved in\n    disseminating and evaluating
      scholarly works: the **Scholarly\n    Communication Platform Framework  \n    **\n\n2.  demonstrate
      the value of this new framework by building a\n    demonstration prototype called
      the **Journal Observatory**, a\n    resource which combines data on journals
      and other publication\n    platforms from various sources to clarify policy
      information for\n    authors, reviewers and others.\n\n#### **1. Scholarly Communication
      Platform Framework** {#scholarly-communication-platform-framework}\n\n[The Scholarly
      Communication Platform\nFramework](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      a new, high-level, structured language that enables the exchange of\ninformation
      about platforms for scholarly communication. To date, we\nhave focused on enabling
      description of platforms for the dissemination\nand/or evaluation of research
      articles, such as scientific journals,\npreprint servers, and peer review platforms.
      However, the Framework can\nfairly easily be extended in the future to describe
      platforms performing\nother scholarly communication functions (e.g., archiving
      via platforms\nlike LOCKKS/CLOCKKS or Portico), or to describe dissemination/evaluation\nof
      other types of scholarly outputs (books, datasets, software, code,\nmethods,
      materials). The detailed inner-workings and rationale of the\nFramework are

      **2. Journal Observatory prototype** {#journal-observatory-prototype}\n\nThe
      Journal Observatory prototype is a proof-of-concept demonstrator\nwhich integrates
      journal information from diverse open data sources\nincluding DOAJ, Sherpa Romeo
      and others, as well as directly from\npublishers. It shows the power of combining
      information from these\ndifferent sources to support three primary use-case
      areas: open access\npublishing, preprinting and peer review procedures. By making
      this\ninformation available, we support researchers, publishers, funders and\nresearch
      institutions to make informed decisions and monitor compliance.\nThe prototype
      comes both with interfaces for machines and with a\nuser-friendly web interface
      for humans. There are two interfaces for\nmachines: a [SPARQL\nendpoint](https://sparql.journalobservatory.org/sparql){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      a [REST API](https://api.journalobservatory.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe web
      interface for humans is provided by the [Journal Observatory\nBrowser](https://app.journalobservatory.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.

      alt=\"The Journal Observatory\" />\n</figure>\n\n### **Next steps**\n\nThe Journal
      Observatory project has achieved much within a limited\ntimeframe and with limited
      resources. We see our project and its outputs\nas the start or continuation,
      not the end, of a much larger\nconversation. We hope our work will provide a
      base for a more ambitious\nlong-term agenda, co-shaped with the wider scholarly
      community, and\naimed at working toward open and interoperable infrastructure
      for\nproviding systematic and reliable information on scholarly journals and\nother
      scholarly communication platforms.  \n\n### **The community event**\n\nTo mark
      the end of the project and to launch the project''s results, we\norganized an
      [online community\nevent](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\"_blank\"}
      on\nApril 25. During the event, we presented our work, including a live demo\nof
      the Journal Observatory Browser to show how the tool can support\nusers in efficiently
      finding answers to questions like: what journals in\nmy field (e.g. sustainability
      research) provide options for Diamond Open\nAccess publishing? How do the preprinting
      policies of two journals\ncompare? What journals in my field adhere to Open
      Peer Review, in the\nsense of publishing review reports?  \n\nThe demonstration
      was followed by Lucy Ofiesh''s (Director of Finance &\nOperations at Crossref)
      talk on the Principles of Open Scholarly\nInfrastructure (POSI). Lucy described
      how these principles, developed as\na community resource to help guide organizations,
      can support the\nresilience and sustainability of open infrastructure that serves
      the\nscholarly communications ecosystem.\n\nThe event was concluded by a panel
      discussion in which three of the\nproject''s stakeholder advisory board members
      discussed their perspective\non the need and future of interoperable, systematically-collected\ninformation
      on scholarly communication platforms. Johan Rooryck\n(Executive Director of
      cOAlition S), Catriona MacCallum (Director of\nOpen Science at Hindawi Publishing)
      and Gabe Stein (Head of Operations\nand Product at the Knowledge Futures Group)
      shared their view from the\nperspective of a research agency coalition, publisher
      and infrastructure\nprovider, respectively. They agreed that there is a dire
      need for the\nkind of service provided by initiatives like the Journal Observatory\nproject,
      but also identified several challenges on the road towards\nsustainability of
      such initiatives.\n\nThe recording of the event can be watched\n[here](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n###

      Observatory project has achieved much within a limited\ntimeframe and with limited
      resources. We see our project and its outputs\nas the start or continuation,
      not the end, of a much larger\nconversation. We hope our work will provide a
      base for a more ambitious\nlong-term agenda, co-shaped with the wider scholarly
      community, and\naimed at working toward open and interoperable infrastructure
      for\nproviding systematic and reliable information on scholarly journals and\nother
      scholarly communication platforms.  \n\n### **The community event**\n\nTo mark
      the end of the project and to launch the project''s results, we\norganized an
      [online community\nevent](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\"_blank\"}
      on\nApril 25. During the event, we presented our work, including a live demo\nof
      the Journal Observatory Browser to show how the tool can support\nusers in efficiently
      finding answers to questions like: what journals in\nmy field (e.g. sustainability
      research) provide options for Diamond Open\nAccess publishing? How do the preprinting
      policies of two journals\ncompare? What journals in my field adhere to Open
      Peer Review, in the\nsense of publishing review reports?  \n\nThe demonstration
      was followed by Lucy Ofiesh''s (Director of Finance &\nOperations at Crossref)
      talk on the Principles of Open Scholarly\nInfrastructure (POSI). Lucy described
      how these principles, developed as\na community resource to help guide organizations,
      can support the\nresilience and sustainability of open infrastructure that serves
      the\nscholarly communications ecosystem.\n\nThe event was concluded by a panel
      discussion in which three of the\nproject''s stakeholder advisory board members
      discussed their perspective\non the need and future of interoperable, systematically-collected\ninformation
      on scholarly communication platforms. Johan Rooryck\n(Executive Director of
      cOAlition S), Catriona MacCallum (Director of\nOpen Science at Hindawi Publishing)
      and Gabe Stein (Head of Operations\nand Product at the Knowledge Futures Group)
      shared their view from the\nperspective of a research agency coalition, publisher
      and infrastructure\nprovider, respectively. They agreed that there is a dire
      need for the\nkind of service provided by initiatives like the Journal Observatory\nproject,
      but also identified several challenges on the road towards\nsustainability of
      such initiatives.\n\nThe recording of the event can be watched\n[here](https://www.journalobservatory.org/event/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n###

      aims to\ncontribute to making available the information needed by these\nstakeholders.  \n\n###
      The current landscape, and its shortcomings\n\nThere are numerous initiatives
      and platforms providing some part of the\npuzzle, but information is scattered,
      incomplete, and difficult to\ncompare. For example, tools and databases are
      available that help\nresearchers understand how to make their research openly
      accessible\n(DOAJ), whether their work can be posted in a repository or on a\npreprint
      server (Sherpa Romeo), how to ensure compliance with funder\nrequirements (Plan
      S Journal Checker Tool), and how to pick a\npublication platform that offers
      particular peer review approaches\n(Transpose), open science practices (TOP
      factor), or that is considered\nto have a sufficiently high citation impact
      (Journal Citation Reports).\n\nGiven this complexity, it seems unrealistic to
      expect stakeholders to\nknow which tools or databases to use to obtain specific
      information.\n\nAs new models of publishing such as Publish-Review-Curate, publication\nas
      you go, preprint review and others emerge, distinct publishing\nfunctions like
      dissemination and evaluation are increasingly decoupled.\nThis creates the need
      for different platforms to interact and at least\nto be aware of each other''s
      policies and requirements. At present, there\nare minimal standards to enable
      the systematic interoperability of these\nplatforms. At the research output
      level, standards like\n[DocMaps](https://docmaps.knowledgefutures.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nthe [COAR\nNotify](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/){target=\"_blank\"}\nprotocol
      are under development. However, to empower further innovation\nin scholarly
      communication, a shared way to describe these different\nplatforms and their
      possibilities of interaction is required.  \n\n### The Journal Observatory project:
      aims and approach\n\nTo address this challenge, our project aims to:  \n\n1.  define
      an extensible, machine-readable and traceable way to describe\n    the policies
      and practices of the various platforms involved in\n    disseminating and evaluating
      scholarly works: the **Scholarly\n    Communication Platform Framework  \n    **\n\n2.  demonstrate
      the value of this new framework by building a\n    demonstration prototype called
      the **Journal Observatory**, a\n    resource which combines data on journals
      and other publication\n    platforms from various sources to clarify policy
      information for\n    authors, reviewers and others.\n\n#### **1. Scholarly Communication
      Platform Framework** {#scholarly-communication-platform-framework}\n\n[The Scholarly
      Communication Platform\nFramework](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      a new, high-level, structured language that enables the exchange of\ninformation
      about platforms for scholarly communication. To date, we\nhave focused on enabling
      description of platforms for the dissemination\nand/or evaluation of research
      articles, such as scientific journals,\npreprint servers, and peer review platforms.
      However, the Framework can\nfairly easily be extended in the future to describe
      platforms performing\nother scholarly communication functions (e.g., archiving
      via platforms\nlike LOCKKS/CLOCKKS or Portico), or to describe dissemination/evaluation\nof
      other types of scholarly outputs (books, datasets, software, code,\nmethods,
      materials). The detailed inner-workings and rationale of the\nFramework are
      described in our [technical\nreport](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7860610){target=\"_blank\"}.\nDocumentation
      and source code can be found on the [project''s\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/framework/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n####
      **2. Journal Observatory prototype** {#journal-observatory-prototype}\n\nThe
      Journal Observatory prototype is a proof-of-concept demonstrator\nwhich integrates
      journal information from diverse open data sources\nincluding DOAJ, Sherpa Romeo
      and others, as well as directly from\npublishers. It shows the power of combining
      information from these\ndifferent sources to support three primary use-case
      areas: open access\npublishing, preprinting and peer review procedures. By making
      this\ninformation available, we support researchers, publishers, funders and\nresearch
      institutions to make informed decisions and monitor compliance.\nThe prototype
      comes both with interfaces for machines and with a\nuser-friendly web interface
      for humans. There are two interfaces for\nmachines: a [SPARQL\nendpoint](https://sparql.journalobservatory.org/sparql){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      a [REST API](https://api.journalobservatory.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe web
      interface for humans is provided by the [Journal Observatory\nBrowser](https://app.journalobservatory.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      More\ninformation about the prototype, including documentation and source\ncode,
      can be found on the [project''s\nwebpage](https://www.journalobservatory.org/prototype/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/The-Journal-Observatory.png\"\ndata-image=\"33680\"

      now part of the governance canon of higher education. However, the\nmultiple
      forms this type of partnership can adopt are not so clear for\nevery junior-faculty,
      administrators, and from there to the\ntop-management in the higher education
      sector. In addition, the\nlandscape of Industry-University partnerships can
      get fuzzy --- not to\nmention difficult --- given the [scarce resources dedicated
      to research\nand development in middle and low-income\ncountries](https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en/report-series){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nTake
      Latin America and the Caribbean as an example. There are no\nLatin-American
      companies listed in [Clarivate\\''s Top-100 Global\nInnovators](https://clarivate.com/top-100-innovators/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      addition, as of 2022 there are only two companies ranked in the\n[SCImago Institutions\nRanking](https://www.scimagoir.com/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which assesses\ninstitutions worldwide in terms of research performance, innovation\noutput,
      and societal impact. Those companies were Petrobras and Estacio\nParticipacoes
      AS. Petrobras is one of the largest companies in the\npetroleum industry in
      the region, while Estacio Participacoes focuses on\nprivate educational services
      in Brazil.\n\nGiven the absence of Latin-American private organizations in the
      global\ninnovation sphere, it is both relevant and urgent to identify highly\nstrategic
      research fields in regions with restricted financial resources\nand underdeveloped
      industry ecosystems. For instance, in 2019 the\naverage [research and development
      expenditure in the region was a mere\n0.7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=XJ){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAlso,
      it is of high value to map research fields\nstill-to-be-explored-and-exploited
      via Industry-University partnerships.\n\n### Mapping the research-fronts of
      industry in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nIn a [study published in the
      Journal of Information\nScience](https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221131796){target=\"_blank\"},
      I\nidentified highly strategic research-fronts for both industry and\nresearch
      intensive institutions, universities among them, in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean.
      I applied a technique used to establish\ninterconnections and clustering between
      knowledge domains. This\ntechnique is called [bibliographic\ncoupling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.5090140103){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThe
      bibliographic coupling approach enables us to examine the underlying\nstructure
      of the knowledge required for researchers to produce new\nknowledge. This technique
      is quite versatile. It can process highly\nmultidisciplinary amounts of research
      documents, such as research on the\n[Sustainable Development\nGoals](https://clarivate.com/lp/navigating-the-structure-of-research-on-sustainable-development-goals-2/){target=\"_blank\"}\nor
      the [complete set of articles published in the journal\n*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03308-7){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      150 years of history.\n\nThe approach for coupling two documents is straightforward.
      See the\nfigure below this paragraph. Let\\''s suppose that I\\''m writing an
      article\non biotechnology (A, in Figure 1), and you, the reader, are writing
      an\narticle on bioeconomy (B, in Figure 1). We do not know each other.\nHowever,
      we found an interesting article or any other type of scholarly\ncommunication
      such as a book chapter, policy paper, and the like, on\n*thebioeconomy of biotech*
      (C, in Figure 1). Now, we read and assess\nthat scholarly communication, and
      decide to include it in our own study.\nWe cite it and by that common citation
      our documents are now connected.\nThe same applies to the fields of research
      of publication A and B:\nBecause of A and B being connected, biotechnology and
      bioeconomy now\nshare a link as well.  \n\nIn this first step, the bibliographic
      coupling detects the shared\nreferences between research articles to interconnect
      them. Then, in a\nsecond step, it is also feasible to interconnect the research
      field of\nthe journals in which those articles were published, thereby assembling\na
      network of research fields based on the research articles coupled.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/bibliographic_coupling_II.png\"\nalt=\"Bibliographic
      coupling II\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Bibliographic coupling.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI
      applied this process to a sample of 13,000+ research articles indexed\nin the
      bibliographic database\n[Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      articles sourced had to be coauthored by at least one author\naffiliated with
      an institution in Latin America and the Caribbean ---\neither public or private
      ---, and the same author or another coauthor\naffiliated with a private organization
      in any other country.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, the bibliographic coupling
      enables us to\ninterconnect the research articles produced with industry collaboration\nand
      the underlying structure of the knowledge required for their\ndevelopment. Once
      these articles and the academic journals in which they\nwere published were
      identified, I use the research fields\\''\nclassification of the journals to
      assemble a research field network as\nfollows.\n\nEach academic journal indexed
      in Scopus receives a classification to a\nsingle or multiple research field
      based on the [All Science Journal\nClassification](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/){target=\"_blank\"}\nsystem.
      There are over 330 research fields, categorized into five areas,\nnamely physical
      sciences, life sciences, health sciences, social\nsciences & humanities, and
      multidisciplinary. In consequence, if two\narticles connected via bibliographic
      coupling were published in a\njournal with two classifications such as biotechnology
      and\nbioengineering, and a second journal with a single classification in\nmolecular
      medicine, the research field network based on these two\njournals is composed
      by three interconnected fields: biotechnology,\nbioengineering, and molecular
      medicine.\n\nAlso, I calculated betweenness centrality, [an\nindicator](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01222-2){target=\"_blank\"}\nfor
      each research field that unveils its strategic position within the\nnetwork.
      Figure 2 shows the network layout with the research-fields with\nhigh strategic
      position, proportional to the size of the nodes. Also, it\nshows the time of
      the first publication of a given research-field.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/research-fronts_III_880_2023-04-12-100133_cbwp.png\"\nalt=\"Research

      Physical science, the most active. Multidisciplinary, the most strategic  {#physical-science-the-most-active.-multidisciplinary-the-most-strategic}\n\nResults
      showed that multiple research-fields from different research\nareas were active
      in industry-research collaborations (further on called\nindustry research fronts).
      Physical science had the most active role.\nThe least active role went to social
      sciences and humanities.\n\nThe research area of physical science with fields
      such as computer\nscience applications, information systems, electrical & electronic\nengineering,
      energy engineering and power technology took about \\~38% of\nthe total nodes
      of the network. Health sciences made up 23% of the\nnodes. In this area, we
      can find research-fields such as public health,\nenvironmental and occupational
      health, or general medicine. For the case\nof life sciences, an area with \\~19%
      of the nodes, we can find\nresearch-fields such as genetics, pharmacology, or
      agronomy and crop\nscience. Finally, for social sciences and humanities, with
      \\~18% of the\nfields, we can find fields such as strategy and management, geography,\nplanning
      and development, or economics and econometrics.\n\nDespite having just one node
      in the network, the area of\nmultidisciplinary research had the highest betweenness
      centrality.\nMultidisciplinary research was mostly published in scientific journals\nsuch
      as [PLoS\nONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\"_blank\"}.\nAccording
      to this journal, they accept: \\\"[over two hundred subject\nareas across science,
      engineering, medicine, and the related social\nsciences and\nhumanities](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\"_blank\"}.\\\"\nTherefore,
      it is quite difficult to dimension multidisciplinary research\nas a single research
      front, despite its highly strategic position in the\nresearch fronts network.
      More so, to outline specific recommendations\nand a plausible course of action
      to follow through the\nIndustry-University partnership.\u00a0\n\n### Uncharted
      research-fronts\n\nThrough recognizing research fronts, I could determine which\nresearch-fields
      had yet to be explored or exploited by\nindustry-institutions. Most of these
      research-fields were from health\nsciences, such as emergency medicine, care
      planning, or optometry,\nfollowed by fields in the social sciences and humanities,
      such\ndemography or life-span and life-course studies.\n\nHere lie plausible
      interconnections between the aforementioned uncharted\nfields. For instance,
      [the number of US citizens aged over 65 is\nprojected to double by\n2060](https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIs
      it a tangible research front plausibly formed by care planning and\ndemography?
      Is it a potential research front for industry-research\ninstitutions in Latin
      America and the Caribbean?\n\nWhat I have discussed here could be of great use
      to industry and\nresearch institutions. As a first insight, both parties can
      identify\nmature and emergent research fronts and assess how strategic their\nresearch
      capacities are amid the bibliographic network structure.\nSecond, they can identify
      research fields clustered nearby and gauge how\nlikely or attractive it might
      be to delve into different fields.\nFinally, parties can see more clearly which
      research fields are still\nunexplored by joint efforts between research institutions
      and industry.\nFurther studies could also source other types of research institutions\nand
      industry knowledge outputs such as patents and patent-citation data\nto expand
      industry and research institution endeavors.  \n\n[  \nHeader image:\u00a0Laurel

      in Brazil.\\n\\nGiven the absence of Latin-American private organizations in

      now part of the governance canon of higher education. However, the\\nmultiple
      forms this type of partnership can adopt are not so clear for\\nevery junior-faculty,
      administrators, and from there to the\\ntop-management in the higher education
      sector. In addition, the\\nlandscape of Industry-University partnerships can
      get fuzzy --- not to\\nmention difficult --- given the [scarce resources dedicated
      to research\\nand development in middle and low-income\\ncountries](https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en/report-series){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nTake
      Latin America and the Caribbean as an example. There are no\\nLatin-American
      companies listed in [Clarivate\\\\'s Top-100 Global\\nInnovators](https://clarivate.com/top-100-innovators/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      addition, as of 2022 there are only two companies ranked in the\\n[SCImago Institutions\\nRanking](https://www.scimagoir.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which assesses\\ninstitutions worldwide in terms of research performance, innovation\\noutput,
      and societal impact. Those companies were Petrobras and Estacio\\nParticipacoes
      AS. Petrobras is one of the largest companies in the\\npetroleum industry in
      the region, while Estacio Participacoes focuses on\\nprivate educational services
      in Brazil.\\n\\nGiven the absence of Latin-American private organizations in
      the global\\ninnovation sphere, it is both relevant and urgent to identify highly\\nstrategic
      research fields in regions with restricted financial resources\\nand underdeveloped
      industry ecosystems. For instance, in 2019 the\\naverage [research and development
      expenditure in the region was a mere\\n0.7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=XJ){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAlso,
      it is of high value to map research fields\\nstill-to-be-explored-and-exploited
      via Industry-University partnerships.\\n\\n### Mapping the research-fronts of
      industry in Latin America and the Caribbean\\n\\nIn a [study published in the
      Journal of Information\\nScience](https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515221131796){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      I\\nidentified highly strategic research-fronts for both industry and\\nresearch
      intensive institutions, universities among them, in Latin\\nAmerica and the
      Caribbean. I applied a technique used to establish\\ninterconnections and clustering
      between knowledge domains. This\\ntechnique is called [bibliographic\\ncoupling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.5090140103){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      bibliographic coupling approach enables us to examine the underlying\\nstructure
      of the knowledge required for researchers to produce new\\nknowledge. This technique
      is quite versatile. It can process highly\\nmultidisciplinary amounts of research
      documents, such as research on the\\n[Sustainable Development\\nGoals](https://clarivate.com/lp/navigating-the-structure-of-research-on-sustainable-development-goals-2/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      the [complete set of articles published in the journal\\n*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03308-7){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      150 years of history.\\n\\nThe approach for coupling two documents is straightforward.
      See the\\nfigure below this paragraph. Let\\\\'s suppose that I\\\\'m writing
      an article\\non biotechnology (A, in Figure 1), and you, the reader, are writing
      an\\narticle on bioeconomy (B, in Figure 1). We do not know each other.\\nHowever,
      we found an interesting article or any other type of scholarly\\ncommunication
      such as a book chapter, policy paper, and the like, on\\n*thebioeconomy of biotech*
      (C, in Figure 1). Now, we read and assess\\nthat scholarly communication, and
      decide to include it in our own study.\\nWe cite it and by that common citation
      our documents are now connected.\\nThe same applies to the fields of research
      of publication A and B:\\nBecause of A and B being connected, biotechnology
      and bioeconomy now\\nshare a link as well.  \\n\\nIn this first step, the bibliographic
      coupling detects the shared\\nreferences between research articles to interconnect
      them. Then, in a\\nsecond step, it is also feasible to interconnect the research
      field of\\nthe journals in which those articles were published, thereby assembling\\na
      network of research fields based on the research articles coupled.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/bibliographic_coupling_II.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Bibliographic
      coupling II\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Bibliographic coupling.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nI
      applied this process to a sample of 13,000+ research articles indexed\\nin the
      bibliographic database\\n[Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      articles sourced had to be coauthored by at least one author\\naffiliated with
      an institution in Latin America and the Caribbean ---\\neither public or private
      ---, and the same author or another coauthor\\naffiliated with a private organization
      in any other country.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, the bibliographic coupling
      enables us to\\ninterconnect the research articles produced with industry collaboration\\nand
      the underlying structure of the knowledge required for their\\ndevelopment.
      Once these articles and the academic journals in which they\\nwere published
      were identified, I use the research fields\\\\'\\nclassification of the journals
      to assemble a research field network as\\nfollows.\\n\\nEach academic journal
      indexed in Scopus receives a classification to a\\nsingle or multiple research
      field based on the [All Science Journal\\nClassification](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15181/supporthub/scopus/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsystem.
      There are over 330 research fields, categorized into five areas,\\nnamely physical
      sciences, life sciences, health sciences, social\\nsciences & humanities, and
      multidisciplinary. In consequence, if two\\narticles connected via bibliographic
      coupling were published in a\\njournal with two classifications such as biotechnology
      and\\nbioengineering, and a second journal with a single classification in\\nmolecular
      medicine, the research field network based on these two\\njournals is composed
      by three interconnected fields: biotechnology,\\nbioengineering, and molecular
      medicine.\\n\\nAlso, I calculated betweenness centrality, [an\\nindicator](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01222-2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      each research field that unveils its strategic position within the\\nnetwork.
      Figure 2 shows the network layout with the research-fields with\\nhigh strategic
      position, proportional to the size of the nodes. Also, it\\nshows the time of
      the first publication of a given research-field.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/research-fronts_III_880_2023-04-12-100133_cbwp.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Research

      Physical science, the most active. Multidisciplinary, the most strategic  {#physical-science-the-most-active.-multidisciplinary-the-most-strategic}\\n\\nResults
      showed that multiple research-fields from different research\\nareas were active
      in industry-research collaborations (further on called\\nindustry research fronts).
      Physical science had the most active role.\\nThe least active role went to social
      sciences and humanities.\\n\\nThe research area of physical science with fields
      such as computer\\nscience applications, information systems, electrical & electronic\\nengineering,
      energy engineering and power technology took about \\\\~38% of\\nthe total nodes
      of the network. Health sciences made up 23% of the\\nnodes. In this area, we
      can find research-fields such as public health,\\nenvironmental and occupational
      health, or general medicine. For the case\\nof life sciences, an area with \\\\~19%
      of the nodes, we can find\\nresearch-fields such as genetics, pharmacology,
      or agronomy and crop\\nscience. Finally, for social sciences and humanities,
      with \\\\~18% of the\\nfields, we can find fields such as strategy and management,
      geography,\\nplanning and development, or economics and econometrics.\\n\\nDespite
      having just one node in the network, the area of\\nmultidisciplinary research
      had the highest betweenness centrality.\\nMultidisciplinary research was mostly
      published in scientific journals\\nsuch as [PLoS\\nONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nAccording
      to this journal, they accept: \\\\\\\"[over two hundred subject\\nareas across
      science, engineering, medicine, and the related social\\nsciences and\\nhumanities](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\\\\\\"\\nTherefore,
      it is quite difficult to dimension multidisciplinary research\\nas a single
      research front, despite its highly strategic position in the\\nresearch fronts
      network. More so, to outline specific recommendations\\nand a plausible course
      of action to follow through the\\nIndustry-University partnership.\_\\n\\n###
      Uncharted research-fronts\\n\\nThrough recognizing research fronts, I could
      determine which\\nresearch-fields had yet to be explored or exploited by\\nindustry-institutions.
      Most of these research-fields were from health\\nsciences, such as emergency
      medicine, care planning, or optometry,\\nfollowed by fields in the social sciences
      and humanities, such\\ndemography or life-span and life-course studies.\\n\\nHere
      lie plausible interconnections between the aforementioned uncharted\\nfields.
      For instance, [the number of US citizens aged over 65 is\\nprojected to double
      by\\n2060](https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIs
      it a tangible research front plausibly formed by care planning and\\ndemography?
      Is it a potential research front for industry-research\\ninstitutions in Latin
      America and the Caribbean?\\n\\nWhat I have discussed here could be of great
      use to industry and\\nresearch institutions. As a first insight, both parties
      can identify\\nmature and emergent research fronts and assess how strategic
      their\\nresearch capacities are amid the bibliographic network structure.\\nSecond,
      they can identify research fields clustered nearby and gauge how\\nlikely or
      attractive it might be to delve into different fields.\\nFinally, parties can
      see more clearly which research fields are still\\nunexplored by joint efforts
      between research institutions and industry.\\nFurther studies could also source
      other types of research institutions\\nand industry knowledge outputs such as
      patents and patent-citation data\\nto expand industry and research institution
      endeavors.  \\n\\n[  \\nHeader image:\_Laurel and Michael Evans on\\n[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/mfq1Bml-ITY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[](https://unsplash.com/photos/D_YZmKGSyic?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}]{.caption}\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/unlocking-the-research-fronts-of-industry-and-research-institutions\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      "blog_slug": "leidenmadtrics", "content_text": "Open science has gained significant
      momentum over the past few years,\nwith various movements and initiatives emerging
      to promote sharing of\nscientific knowledge, data, and resources with the wider
      community. Open\nscience is a broad term encompassing a range of practices that
      strive to\nincrease transparency, inclusivity, and accessibility in science.
      The\nexpected benefits of open science are manifold, from accelerating\nscientific
      progress, enhancing scientific rigour, promoting responsible\nresearch, and
      ensuring public trust in science.\n\nWith that in mind, the research councils
      of the Netherlands (NWO) and\nNorway (RCN) joined hands with CWTS to organize
      a seminar series on open\nscience throughout 2022. The seminars aimed to enrich
      and expand the\nunderstanding of open science within the agencies, focusing
      on programme\nand policy officers and connected professionals interested in
      the\nsubject.\n\nAware of the challenges to reaching all those interested within
      NWO and\nRCN, we decided to create a knowledge platform to store and share the\ncontent
      from the seminars so they could be attended asynchronously.\nMoreover, recognizing
      the value of the produced content to a broader\naudience, we decided to put
      the idea of openness into practice, making\nthe platform open to the public.\n\n###
      [**The knowledge platform**](https://open-science.cwts.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThe
      knowledge platform features videos from the seminar series\npresentations, including
      lectures from Thed van Leeuwen, Ludo Waltman,\nWolfgang Kaltenbrunner, and myself.
      Open science champions, as we call\nthe many experts that shared experiences
      and their perspectives with our\naudience, are also there. Additionally, the
      platform includes support\nmaterials, access to the slides used in our presentations,
      links to\nrelevant resources and literature, and more.\n\nThe seminar series
      consisted of four individual seminars, included as\ndifferent sections in the
      platform. Each one of them covered specific\naspects of open science:\n\n####
      [*Introduction to open science*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/introduction-to-os-five-schools-of-open-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThe
      first seminar provided an overview of the complexity of open science\nas more
      of an umbrella term than a well-defined concept. From that\nperspective, open
      science refers to a series of movements to remove\nbarriers to sharing any scientific
      output, resources, methods, or tools\nand bringing scientific results closer
      to the general public. Through a\nseries of examples, we adopted the model of
      five schools of thought\nproposed by [Fecher and\nFriesike](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\"_blank\"}\n(2014)
      to understand open science in its multiple dimensions, from being\ndemocratic
      to its role in recognition and rewards.\n\n#### *[Open scholarly communication](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-scholarly-communication){target=\"_blank\"}*\n\nThe
      second seminar delved into open scholarly communication. It covered\ntopics
      such as open access publishing, article processing charges\n(APCs), Plan S,
      pre-printing, and open peer review. The seminar also\ncovered newer forms of
      scholarly publishing, with diverse levels of\nopenness, and the transition towards
      a more democratic future in\nscience.\n\n#### [*Open data, software and infrastructures*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-data-software-and-infrastructures){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThe
      third seminar focused on aspects connected to the infrastructure\nschool of
      open science, including open data, how to make data FAIR\n(Findable, Accessible,
      Interoperable, and Reusable), and data management\nplans, as well as recent
      developments in the sharing of code and\nsoftware. The seminar also covered
      necessary infrastructures for open\nscience, such as repositories.\n\n#### [*Recognition
      & rewards and responsible research assessment*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/recognition-and-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment){target=\"_blank\"}
      {#recognition-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment}\n\nThe fourth seminar
      approached an important ongoing development in the\nacademic world, connecting
      openness to issues related to recognition &\nrewards and responsible research
      assessment. The seminar covered the\ncurrent state of those issues and the challenges
      that arise from them.\nIt also discussed responsible research assessment, the
      development of\nnational matrixes for career assessment, the movement towards
      adopting\nnarrative CVs, and the importance of transparency and reproducibility
      in\nopen science.\n\n### Next steps\n\nTo call something a knowledge platform
      is undoubtedly ambitious. Our\nfour open science seminars were designed to introduce
      fundamental\nconcepts and to put these in the context of ongoing policy initiatives.\nWe
      recognize there is still much more to explore, so we built the\nplatform to
      be updated and expanded. In this way, new topics can be\nadded to follow the
      development of open science and enrich the\nplatform\\''s content.\n\nFor instance,
      at CWTS, we already plan to delve into topics such as the\nopen science pillars
      proposed by the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the convergence of open science and Responsible Research and\nInnovation (RRI).
      We are also interested, for instance, in learning from\nthe Global South\\''s
      efforts in the diamond open access model over the\npast two decades.\n\nWe also
      welcome contributions from new open science champions, as the\nplatform is open
      to growth and development. If you would like to be part\nof this effort, please
      reach out [to\nme](mailto:a.l.brasil@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Launching\nthe open science knowledge platform is a first step to something
      bigger,\nto a dynamic resource that evolves, reflecting the constantly changing\nnature
      of open science.\n\n### **Reflections on a co-creation process**\n\nThe journey
      to prepare our seminar series and organize the contents into\na knowledge platform
      has been quite interesting and rewarding. While we\nhad the chance to debate
      the state of the art of open science within\nCWTS, we had to build a practical
      program that could be valuable to\nthose working with the topic at different
      levels, including funding,\nevaluation, and policy design. That was a mission
      accomplished by\nadopting a co-creation perspective with our partners at NWO
      and RCN. So,\nwe very much like to thank Maria Cruz, Anthony Gadsdon, Marte
      Qvenild,\nand Christian Lund not only for fruitful discussions around the program\nand
      the outcomes, but also for an active partnership in every seminar.\n\nFurthermore,
      it''s also quite important for us to thank our champions.\nEarly in the design
      of the seminar series, we decided to invite\nadditional experts to contribute
      with their own ideas, perspectives, and\nexperiences on open science. The nine
      champions that joined us have\nexpanded our own understanding on open science
      and helped us create a\nmuch more comprehensive seminars than we would be able
      to do alone. So,\nwe also extend our thanks to Sonja Grossberndt, Sanli Faez,
      John Arne\nR\u00f8ttingen, Anne Scheel, Anna van''t Veer, Marjan Grootveld,
      Korbinian\nB\u00f6ls, Kim Huijpen, and Alexander Jensenius.\n\nAnd with that,

      from accelerating\\nscientific progress, enhancing scientific rigour, promoting
      responsible\\nresearch, and ensuring public trust in science.\\n\\nWith that
      in mind, the research councils of the Netherlands (NWO) and\\nNorway (RCN) joined
      hands with CWTS to organize a seminar series on open\\nscience throughout 2022.
      The seminars aimed to enrich and expand the\\nunderstanding of open science
      within the agencies, focusing on programme\\nand policy officers and connected
      professionals interested in the\\nsubject.\\n\\nAware of the challenges to reaching
      all those interested within NWO and\\nRCN, we decided to create a knowledge
      platform to store and share the\\ncontent from the seminars so they could be
      attended asynchronously.\\nMoreover, recognizing the value of the produced content
      to a broader\\naudience, we decided to put the idea of openness into practice,
      making\\nthe platform open to the public.\\n\\n### [**The knowledge platform**](https://open-science.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      knowledge platform features videos from the seminar series\\npresentations,
      including lectures from Thed van Leeuwen, Ludo Waltman,\\nWolfgang Kaltenbrunner,
      and myself. Open science champions, as we call\\nthe many experts that shared
      experiences and their perspectives with our\\naudience, are also there. Additionally,
      the platform includes support\\nmaterials, access to the slides used in our
      presentations, links to\\nrelevant resources and literature, and more.\\n\\nThe
      seminar series consisted of four individual seminars, included as\\ndifferent
      sections in the platform. Each one of them covered specific\\naspects of open
      science:\\n\\n#### [*Introduction to open science*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/introduction-to-os-five-schools-of-open-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      first seminar provided an overview of the complexity of open science\\nas more
      of an umbrella term than a well-defined concept. From that\\nperspective, open
      science refers to a series of movements to remove\\nbarriers to sharing any
      scientific output, resources, methods, or tools\\nand bringing scientific results
      closer to the general public. Through a\\nseries of examples, we adopted the
      model of five schools of thought\\nproposed by [Fecher and\\nFriesike](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(2014)
      to understand open science in its multiple dimensions, from being\\ndemocratic
      to its role in recognition and rewards.\\n\\n#### *[Open scholarly communication](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-scholarly-communication){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*\\n\\nThe
      second seminar delved into open scholarly communication. It covered\\ntopics
      such as open access publishing, article processing charges\\n(APCs), Plan S,
      pre-printing, and open peer review. The seminar also\\ncovered newer forms of
      scholarly publishing, with diverse levels of\\nopenness, and the transition
      towards a more democratic future in\\nscience.\\n\\n#### [*Open data, software
      and infrastructures*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/open-data-software-and-infrastructures){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nThe
      third seminar focused on aspects connected to the infrastructure\\nschool of
      open science, including open data, how to make data FAIR\\n(Findable, Accessible,
      Interoperable, and Reusable), and data management\\nplans, as well as recent
      developments in the sharing of code and\\nsoftware. The seminar also covered
      necessary infrastructures for open\\nscience, such as repositories.\\n\\n####
      [*Recognition & rewards and responsible research assessment*](https://open-science.cwts.nl/introduction/recognition-and-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      {#recognition-rewards-and-responsible-research-assessment}\\n\\nThe fourth seminar
      approached an important ongoing development in the\\nacademic world, connecting
      openness to issues related to recognition &\\nrewards and responsible research
      assessment. The seminar covered the\\ncurrent state of those issues and the
      challenges that arise from them.\\nIt also discussed responsible research assessment,
      the development of\\nnational matrixes for career assessment, the movement towards
      adopting\\nnarrative CVs, and the importance of transparency and reproducibility
      in\\nopen science.\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nTo call something a knowledge platform
      is undoubtedly ambitious. Our\\nfour open science seminars were designed to
      introduce fundamental\\nconcepts and to put these in the context of ongoing
      policy initiatives.\\nWe recognize there is still much more to explore, so we
      built the\\nplatform to be updated and expanded. In this way, new topics can
      be\\nadded to follow the development of open science and enrich the\\nplatform\\\\'s
      content.\\n\\nFor instance, at CWTS, we already plan to delve into topics such
      as the\\nopen science pillars proposed by the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the convergence of open science and Responsible Research and\\nInnovation (RRI).
      We are also interested, for instance, in learning from\\nthe Global South\\\\'s
      efforts in the diamond open access model over the\\npast two decades.\\n\\nWe
      also welcome contributions from new open science champions, as the\\nplatform
      is open to growth and development. If you would like to be part\\nof this effort,
      please reach out [to\\nme](mailto:a.l.brasil@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Launching\\nthe open science knowledge platform is a first step to something
      bigger,\\nto a dynamic resource that evolves, reflecting the constantly changing\\nnature
      of open science.\\n\\n### **Reflections on a co-creation process**\\n\\nThe
      journey to prepare our seminar series and organize the contents into\\na knowledge
      platform has been quite interesting and rewarding. While we\\nhad the chance
      to debate the state of the art of open science within\\nCWTS, we had to build
      a practical program that could be valuable to\\nthose working with the topic
      at different levels, including funding,\\nevaluation, and policy design. That
      was a mission accomplished by\\nadopting a co-creation perspective with our
      partners at NWO and RCN. So,\\nwe very much like to thank Maria Cruz, Anthony

      research funding bodies and universities across Europe have created\ndebate
      about the affordances of an otherwise taken-for-granted\nbureaucratic genre.
      Narrative CVs are meant to tackle a widely perceived\nproblem in relation to
      the use of traditional CV formats in research\nevaluation, namely an [overemphasis

      true innovation and openness of academic career\nsystems](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/117033/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      When\nrecognition and reward are too narrowly conceived and based on\nquantitative
      tallying, broad swathes of academic workers end up feeling\nundervalued or not
      able to play to their strengths, which in turn means\nwaste of talent, a less
      robust/diverse academic system, and persistent\ninequalities and hierarchies.  \n\n<figure
      style=\"float:left; margin-right:35px;margin-top:8px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/15mollie2-300x300.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"18292\"

      CVs instead supplement traditional types of biographical\ninformation with narrative
      elements through which researchers can tell\nmore contextual stories about their
      background/ career/ career\nmotivation. Ideally, narrative CVs can help diversify
      criteria of\nsuccess and achievement in research, thereby also diversifying
      the\nscientific workforce and creating more openness for \"irregular\" career\ntrajectories.\n\nAgainst
      the backdrop of these debates, we organized [a 5-day workshop at\nthe Lorentz
      Center in\nLeiden](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/curricula-vitae-as-reproductive-interfaces-in-research.html){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      December 2022 to bring together different academic stakeholders\n(including
      researchers, funders, policy makers, and administrators) to\nreflect on these
      and other new developments in CV territory. In this\npost we share some of our
      main insights. Urgent short-term goals include\nthe need for getting a better
      sense of the extent to which narrative CVs\ncan be effective in addressing the
      above-mentioned issues, and which\npractical conditions must be met for them
      to achieve their potential. In\nthe medium- to long run, we should ensure that
      current narrative CV\nformats are part of a coordinated broader strategy to
      foster inclusive\npractices in research evaluation.\n\n### Historical convergence
      vs a new diversity of CV formats\n\nNarrative CV formats can be seen as merely
      the latest development in the\nevolution of the genre. [Research on the morphology
      of\nCVs](https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvab040/6500313){target=\"_blank\"}\nhas
      for example shown that in the humanities in Germany, a narrative\nformat has
      been gradually replaced by a tabular format during the second\nhalf of the 20th
      century. More research would be needed to substantiate\nhow representative these
      findings are for CV practices in other fields\nand countries. Yet overall, we
      can safely assume that CV formats have\ntended to converge in recent decades,
      following a relatively universal\nstructure based on a range of categories of
      achievements.\n\nThe standardization of formats is in many ways productive.
      For example,\nit has made it possible to create overarching digital infrastructures\nfor
      creating and handling CVs that can also then be reused for specific\napplication
      purposes. During the workshop, we organized an open source\ndata mining session
      that drew on the ORCID database, which contains a\nwealth of biographical profiles
      by researchers that can be used to\ninterrogate empirical questions about [academic
      career systems and\nacademic\ndynamics](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjck6/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      At\nthe same time, it is exactly the uniformity of CV formats that current\nnarrative
      CV initiatives and other critical observers of research\nevaluation systems
      take issue with, since it exerts a form of\nnormalizing power on researchers
      that ultimately urges them to develop\ntheir careers around a rather narrow
      range of categories of\nachievement.  \n\n<figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/18sarah2-300x300.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"18292\"
      />\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe
      narrative CV templates recently introduced by funders and\nuniversities in turn
      are characterized by a diversity in structure and\nformat. At the workshop,
      we took a particularly close look at CV formats\nused by organizations who were
      also represented at our event, which\nincluded the Luxembourg National Research
      Fund (FNR), the Swiss National\nScience Fund (SNSF), and the Research Council
      of the Netherlands (NWO).\nThe formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and Dutch research
      councils all\nask for some narrative of the trajectory and scientific accomplishments\nof
      a researcher. The Swiss format requires up to three shorter\nnarratives, while
      the Luxembourg CV requires applicants to submit a\npersonal statement and a
      personal profile. The format used by the Dutch\nresearch council in turn is
      tailored to different career stages, with\napplicants for more advanced funding
      programs being asked to include an\naccount of their leadership expertise in
      the narrative. Even the very\nterm narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon. Rather
      than creating a sharp\ndistinction between narrative and non-narrative, most
      organizations\nadopting such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines
      more\ntraditional list-based information with narrative elements. One could\nalso
      argue that interpreting any kind of CV\nformat[](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024)[always\nrequires
      an effort at\nnarrativization](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024){target=\"_blank\"},\nso
      as to translate a list of achievements into a trajectory that makes\nsense to
      human evaluators. These points, as well as the current variety\nin novel CV
      formats, caution us not to think of narrative CV formats as\na singular new
      paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless, we\nwill in the following
      present some overarching questions that are\npertinent to most if not all narrative
      CV formats.\n\n### Evaluative use of narrative CVs\n\nA basic assumption that
      seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives is\nthat changing the way information
      is presented to reviewers will also\nchange evaluation practices such as the
      issues discussed in review\npanels. Yet this seems a rather strong supposition.
      If we think of peer\nreview not simply as a mechanism for objectively comparing
      information\nabout applicants but as a practice that is learned through socialization\nin
      academic communities, then we should assume that making use of the\naffordances
      of novel CV formats is not something that comes overnight.\nInstead, we should
      perhaps expect a gradual process in which researchers\nbecome familiar with
      the new format and make progressively more use of\nits features. Empirical investigation
      into this may be useful, e.g., how\ndo panel members actually negotiate and
      interpret evaluative criteria\nwhen using narrative CV formats? Do such practices
      change over time? In\nthe short term, detailed empirical studies that compare
      how review\npanels shortlist and select candidates when presented with narrative
      and\ntraditional CVs would be desirable (see\n[here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y){target=\"_blank\"}\nfor
      a pertinent ongoing research project carried out at Cambridge\nUniversity).\n\nThere
      may also be inadvertent risks in broadening the biographical\ninformation that
      is given as input for reviewers. First, it may be that\nsociocultural biases
      have a higher chance of coming to the fore. Imagine\na scenario where sharing
      personal details such as sexual orientation,\nage, ethnic origin or simply particular
      life choices predispose\nreviewers for or against the author of the CV. Relatedly,
      reviewers may\nbe inclined to evaluate those stories that resemble their own
      more\npositively, a phenomenon often studied under the name of homophily. Both\nbias
      and its specific form of homophily risk undermining ongoing\nattempts to foster
      diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. The\npotential effects of bias
      and homophily may potentially be mitigated by\nunconscious bias training, or
      by assuring reviewer panels are\nsufficiently diverse in terms of gender, ethnic
      origin, nationality and\ncareer stages. Again, empirical research on these questions
      would be\ndesirable. Do bias and homophily occur less or more often when using\nnarrative
      CVs? Are reviewers more likely to call each other out on bias\nand is unconscious
      bias training a suitable answer? Alternatively, can\npanels better deal with
      biases if they cultivate a practice making\nimplicit biases explicit?  \n\n<figure

      />\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Annemijn Algra.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###
      Crafting narratives\n\nA whole other set of unresolved questions arise even
      before evaluation,\nnamely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During the
      workshop, we\nadopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself as an
      academic,\neven experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations in
      CVs\nthat resulted in [a live\nexhibition](https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/){target=\"_blank\"}
      hosted by\nartists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the\nimages in this blog post have been created during that session). While\nnarrative
      CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements,\nthey do create
      the possibility to frame academic work in ways that\nhighlight different dimensions
      of contributions. For example, this\npotentially allows for focusing also on
      desirable but usually somewhat\nundervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication\nand engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in\ninnovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual\nresearchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how\nindividual researchers contribute
      to collaborative work -- for example,\nby giving space to account for community-building
      work that does not\nlead to publications and would normally remain invisible.
      At the same\ntime, the practice of crafting a narrative is also related to\nsociological
      power dynamics, for example to the command of cultural\ncapital, which is unequally
      distributed across researchers in terms of\ndemographic dimensions such as age
      and social origin. Crafting\nnarratives after all requires much more tacit knowledge
      about \\\"how to\npresent yourself\\\" than a standardized tabular format. In
      addition,\ncrafting narratives may come easier for some personality types than\nothers.\n\nThe
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how\ncoherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a\ngroup work session
      chaired by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a\ncritical look at academic
      career advice. Academic career advice\nresources often appear to help reproduce
      rather traditional assumptions\nabout what it means to be a successful researcher.
      One of the takeaways\nwas that the cost of conforming to perceived or real career
      requirements\n[can be\nhigh](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis){target=\"_blank\"},\nboth
      to building viable livelihoods and to health and wellbeing. Many\nresearchers
      still work under the assumption that the goal of doing\nacademic research is
      to become a professor, while other career paths are\nperceived as a form of
      failure. In reality, \"irregular\" trajectories may\nnot just lead to more professional
      fulfillment on the side of the\nresearcher, but may also have unexpected benefits
      for society (e.g.,\nwhen academics engage or contribute to industry, social
      organizations,\nor government). The narrative CV in principle allows for showcasing\ndiverse
      trajectories through academic research, for example in the sense\nof creating
      room to document experience working in other fields,\nprofessions, or experimenting
      with novel methods.\n\nA final important concern is of course the time required
      to craft and\nevaluate narratives, which will often be significant. One way
      of\nreducing this work is to aim for a degree of harmonization of formats\nacross
      organizations. Led by the Royal Society, efforts to achieve this\n[are already\nunderway](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      the UK. A related risk is that narrative CVs could turn into a new\nbusiness
      opportunity for hired consultants, specialized in crafting\ncatchy narratives.
      The attempt to \"optimize\" narrative CVs for\nparticular funding opportunities
      through such professional support would\nseem to undermine the intention of
      using new formats to increase the\ninformational value of CVs, and of course
      it would raise questions about\nwho has or does not have access to the necessary
      resources for such\nsupport. Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative
      CV\nformats, and it may be that a critical assessment or change of direction\nwill
      be required in a few years'' time.\n\n<figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"18292\"
      />\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Bj\u00f6rn Hammarfelt.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###
      A holistic perspective is needed\n\nAs this reflection on some of the key themes
      that came up during the\nworkshop shows, there are lots of opportunities but
      also uncertainties\nrelated to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps\nmost interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates\nreflection
      on practices of research assessment that are usually taken\nfor granted. We
      might say that experiments with novel CV formats\nfunction as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the\nfundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science\nfunding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of\nthe questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to\navoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV\nformats
      are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in\na broader set
      of practices of research assessment. Addressing the\nfoundational problems that
      narrative CV formats are meant to solve will\nrequire an empirically and conceptually
      well-understood view of the\nself-reproduction of the scientific career system
      - both in terms of how\nresearchers plan their careers and present themselves
      strategically for\nassessment purposes, and in terms of the practical functioning
      of\nresearch evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.\n\n[[**  \n**]{.caption}]{.caption}\n\n[[**The

      can help diversify criteria of\\nsuccess and achievement in research, thereby
      also diversifying the\\nscientific workforce and creating more openness for
      \\\"irregular\\\" career\\ntrajectories.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of these
      debates, we organized [a 5-day workshop at\\nthe Lorentz Center in\\nLeiden](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/curricula-vitae-as-reproductive-interfaces-in-research.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      December 2022 to bring together different academic stakeholders\\n(including
      researchers, funders, policy makers, and administrators) to\\nreflect on these
      and other new developments in CV territory. In this\\npost we share some of
      our main insights. Urgent short-term goals include\\nthe need for getting a
      better sense of the extent to which narrative CVs\\ncan be effective in addressing
      the above-mentioned issues, and which\\npractical conditions must be met for
      them to achieve their potential. In\\nthe medium- to long run, we should ensure
      that current narrative CV\\nformats are part of a coordinated broader strategy
      to foster inclusive\\npractices in research evaluation.\\n\\n### Historical
      convergence vs a new diversity of CV formats\\n\\nNarrative CV formats can be
      seen as merely the latest development in the\\nevolution of the genre. [Research
      on the morphology of\\nCVs](https://academic.oup.com/rev/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/reseval/rvab040/6500313){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      for example shown that in the humanities in Germany, a narrative\\nformat has
      been gradually replaced by a tabular format during the second\\nhalf of the
      20th century. More research would be needed to substantiate\\nhow representative
      these findings are for CV practices in other fields\\nand countries. Yet overall,
      we can safely assume that CV formats have\\ntended to converge in recent decades,
      following a relatively universal\\nstructure based on a range of categories
      of achievements.\\n\\nThe standardization of formats is in many ways productive.
      For example,\\nit has made it possible to create overarching digital infrastructures\\nfor
      creating and handling CVs that can also then be reused for specific\\napplication
      purposes. During the workshop, we organized an open source\\ndata mining session
      that drew on the ORCID database, which contains a\\nwealth of biographical profiles
      by researchers that can be used to\\ninterrogate empirical questions about [academic
      career systems and\\nacademic\\ndynamics](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjck6/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      At\\nthe same time, it is exactly the uniformity of CV formats that current\\nnarrative
      CV initiatives and other critical observers of research\\nevaluation systems
      take issue with, since it exerts a form of\\nnormalizing power on researchers
      that ultimately urges them to develop\\ntheir careers around a rather narrow
      range of categories of\\nachievement.  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right;
      margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/18sarah2-300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe
      narrative CV templates recently introduced by funders and\\nuniversities in
      turn are characterized by a diversity in structure and\\nformat. At the workshop,
      we took a particularly close look at CV formats\\nused by organizations who
      were also represented at our event, which\\nincluded the Luxembourg National
      Research Fund (FNR), the Swiss National\\nScience Fund (SNSF), and the Research
      Council of the Netherlands (NWO).\\nThe formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and
      Dutch research councils all\\nask for some narrative of the trajectory and scientific
      accomplishments\\nof a researcher. The Swiss format requires up to three shorter\\nnarratives,
      while the Luxembourg CV requires applicants to submit a\\npersonal statement
      and a personal profile. The format used by the Dutch\\nresearch council in turn
      is tailored to different career stages, with\\napplicants for more advanced
      funding programs being asked to include an\\naccount of their leadership expertise
      in the narrative. Even the very\\nterm narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon.
      Rather than creating a sharp\\ndistinction between narrative and non-narrative,
      most organizations\\nadopting such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines
      more\\ntraditional list-based information with narrative elements. One could\\nalso
      argue that interpreting any kind of CV\\nformat[](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024)[always\\nrequires
      an effort at\\nnarrativization](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nso
      as to translate a list of achievements into a trajectory that makes\\nsense
      to human evaluators. These points, as well as the current variety\\nin novel
      CV formats, caution us not to think of narrative CV formats as\\na singular
      new paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless, we\\nwill in the
      following present some overarching questions that are\\npertinent to most if
      not all narrative CV formats.\\n\\n### Evaluative use of narrative CVs\\n\\nA
      basic assumption that seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives is\\nthat changing
      the way information is presented to reviewers will also\\nchange evaluation
      practices such as the issues discussed in review\\npanels. Yet this seems a
      rather strong supposition. If we think of peer\\nreview not simply as a mechanism
      for objectively comparing information\\nabout applicants but as a practice that
      is learned through socialization\\nin academic communities, then we should assume
      that making use of the\\naffordances of novel CV formats is not something that
      comes overnight.\\nInstead, we should perhaps expect a gradual process in which
      researchers\\nbecome familiar with the new format and make progressively more
      use of\\nits features. Empirical investigation into this may be useful, e.g.,
      how\\ndo panel members actually negotiate and interpret evaluative criteria\\nwhen
      using narrative CV formats? Do such practices change over time? In\\nthe short
      term, detailed empirical studies that compare how review\\npanels shortlist
      and select candidates when presented with narrative and\\ntraditional CVs would
      be desirable (see\\n[here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      a pertinent ongoing research project carried out at Cambridge\\nUniversity).\\n\\nThere
      may also be inadvertent risks in broadening the biographical\\ninformation that
      is given as input for reviewers. First, it may be that\\nsociocultural biases
      have a higher chance of coming to the fore. Imagine\\na scenario where sharing
      personal details such as sexual orientation,\\nage, ethnic origin or simply
      particular life choices predispose\\nreviewers for or against the author of
      the CV. Relatedly, reviewers may\\nbe inclined to evaluate those stories that
      resemble their own more\\npositively, a phenomenon often studied under the name
      of homophily. Both\\nbias and its specific form of homophily risk undermining
      ongoing\\nattempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. The\\npotential
      effects of bias and homophily may potentially be mitigated by\\nunconscious
      bias training, or by assuring reviewer panels are\\nsufficiently diverse in
      terms of gender, ethnic origin, nationality and\\ncareer stages. Again, empirical
      research on these questions would be\\ndesirable. Do bias and homophily occur
      less or more often when using\\nnarrative CVs? Are reviewers more likely to
      call each other out on bias\\nand is unconscious bias training a suitable answer?
      Alternatively, can\\npanels better deal with biases if they cultivate a practice
      making\\nimplicit biases explicit?  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left; margin-right:35px;margin-top:8px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3annemijn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"

      Crafting narratives\\n\\nA whole other set of unresolved questions arise even
      before evaluation,\\nnamely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During
      the workshop, we\\nadopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself
      as an academic,\\neven experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations
      in CVs\\nthat resulted in [a live\\nexhibition](https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      hosted by\\nartists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the\\nimages in this blog post have been created during that session). While\\nnarrative
      CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements,\\nthey do create
      the possibility to frame academic work in ways that\\nhighlight different dimensions
      of contributions. For example, this\\npotentially allows for focusing also on
      desirable but usually somewhat\\nundervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication\\nand engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in\\ninnovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual\\nresearchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how\\nindividual researchers
      contribute to collaborative work -- for example,\\nby giving space to account
      for community-building work that does not\\nlead to publications and would normally
      remain invisible. At the same\\ntime, the practice of crafting a narrative is
      also related to\\nsociological power dynamics, for example to the command of
      cultural\\ncapital, which is unequally distributed across researchers in terms
      of\\ndemographic dimensions such as age and social origin. Crafting\\nnarratives
      after all requires much more tacit knowledge about \\\\\\\"how to\\npresent
      yourself\\\\\\\" than a standardized tabular format. In addition,\\ncrafting
      narratives may come easier for some personality types than\\nothers.\\n\\nThe
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how\\ncoherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a\\ngroup work session
      chaired by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a\\ncritical look at academic
      career advice. Academic career advice\\nresources often appear to help reproduce
      rather traditional assumptions\\nabout what it means to be a successful researcher.
      One of the takeaways\\nwas that the cost of conforming to perceived or real
      career requirements\\n[can be\\nhigh](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nboth
      to building viable livelihoods and to health and wellbeing. Many\\nresearchers
      still work under the assumption that the goal of doing\\nacademic research is
      to become a professor, while other career paths are\\nperceived as a form of
      failure. In reality, \\\"irregular\\\" trajectories may\\nnot just lead to more
      professional fulfillment on the side of the\\nresearcher, but may also have
      unexpected benefits for society (e.g.,\\nwhen academics engage or contribute
      to industry, social organizations,\\nor government). The narrative CV in principle
      allows for showcasing\\ndiverse trajectories through academic research, for
      example in the sense\\nof creating room to document experience working in other
      fields,\\nprofessions, or experimenting with novel methods.\\n\\nA final important
      concern is of course the time required to craft and\\nevaluate narratives, which
      will often be significant. One way of\\nreducing this work is to aim for a degree
      of harmonization of formats\\nacross organizations. Led by the Royal Society,
      efforts to achieve this\\n[are already\\nunderway](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      the UK. A related risk is that narrative CVs could turn into a new\\nbusiness
      opportunity for hired consultants, specialized in crafting\\ncatchy narratives.
      The attempt to \\\"optimize\\\" narrative CVs for\\nparticular funding opportunities
      through such professional support would\\nseem to undermine the intention of
      using new formats to increase the\\ninformational value of CVs, and of course
      it would raise questions about\\nwho has or does not have access to the necessary
      resources for such\\nsupport. Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative
      CV\\nformats, and it may be that a critical assessment or change of direction\\nwill
      be required in a few years' time.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Bj\xF6rn Hammarfelt.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n###
      A holistic perspective is needed\\n\\nAs this reflection on some of the key
      themes that came up during the\\nworkshop shows, there are lots of opportunities
      but also uncertainties\\nrelated to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps\\nmost interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates\\nreflection
      on practices of research assessment that are usually taken\\nfor granted. We
      might say that experiments with novel CV formats\\nfunction as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the\\nfundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science\\nfunding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of\\nthe questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to\\navoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV\\nformats
      are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in\\na broader
      set of practices of research assessment. Addressing the\\nfoundational problems
      that narrative CV formats are meant to solve will\\nrequire an empirically and
      conceptually well-understood view of the\\nself-reproduction of the scientific
      career system - both in terms of how\\nresearchers plan their careers and present
      themselves strategically for\\nassessment purposes, and in terms of the practical
      functioning of\\nresearch evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.\\n\\n[[**

      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Sarah de Rijcke.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe
      narrative CV templates recently introduced by funders and\\nuniversities in
      turn are characterized by a diversity in structure and\\nformat. At the workshop,
      we took a particularly close look at CV formats\\nused by organizations who
      were also represented at our event, which\\nincluded the Luxembourg National
      Research Fund (FNR), the Swiss National\\nScience Fund (SNSF), and the Research
      Council of the Netherlands (NWO).\\nThe formats of the Swiss, Luxembourg, and
      Dutch research councils all\\nask for some narrative of the trajectory and scientific
      accomplishments\\nof a researcher. The Swiss format requires up to three shorter\\nnarratives,
      while the Luxembourg CV requires applicants to submit a\\npersonal statement
      and a personal profile. The format used by the Dutch\\nresearch council in turn
      is tailored to different career stages, with\\napplicants for more advanced
      funding programs being asked to include an\\naccount of their leadership expertise
      in the narrative. Even the very\\nterm narrative CV is not fully agreed-upon.
      Rather than creating a sharp\\ndistinction between narrative and non-narrative,
      most organizations\\nadopting such formats aim for a hybrid document that combines
      more\\ntraditional list-based information with narrative elements. One could\\nalso
      argue that interpreting any kind of CV\\nformat[](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024)[always\\nrequires
      an effort at\\nnarrativization](https://valuationstudies.liu.se/article/view/842/1024){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nso
      as to translate a list of achievements into a trajectory that makes\\nsense
      to human evaluators. These points, as well as the current variety\\nin novel
      CV formats, caution us not to think of narrative CV formats as\\na singular
      new paradigm replacing existing conventions. Nevertheless, we\\nwill in the
      following present some overarching questions that are\\npertinent to most if
      not all narrative CV formats.\\n\\n### Evaluative use of narrative CVs\\n\\nA
      basic assumption that seems to underpin narrative CV initiatives is\\nthat changing
      the way information is presented to reviewers will also\\nchange evaluation
      practices such as the issues discussed in review\\npanels. Yet this seems a
      rather strong supposition. If we think of peer\\nreview not simply as a mechanism
      for objectively comparing information\\nabout applicants but as a practice that
      is learned through socialization\\nin academic communities, then we should assume
      that making use of the\\naffordances of novel CV formats is not something that
      comes overnight.\\nInstead, we should perhaps expect a gradual process in which
      researchers\\nbecome familiar with the new format and make progressively more
      use of\\nits features. Empirical investigation into this may be useful, e.g.,
      how\\ndo panel members actually negotiate and interpret evaluative criteria\\nwhen
      using narrative CV formats? Do such practices change over time? In\\nthe short
      term, detailed empirical studies that compare how review\\npanels shortlist
      and select candidates when presented with narrative and\\ntraditional CVs would
      be desirable (see\\n[here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/332844/Narrative%20CVs%20drive%20change%20in%20OR%20practice.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfor
      a pertinent ongoing research project carried out at Cambridge\\nUniversity).\\n\\nThere
      may also be inadvertent risks in broadening the biographical\\ninformation that
      is given as input for reviewers. First, it may be that\\nsociocultural biases
      have a higher chance of coming to the fore. Imagine\\na scenario where sharing
      personal details such as sexual orientation,\\nage, ethnic origin or simply
      particular life choices predispose\\nreviewers for or against the author of
      the CV. Relatedly, reviewers may\\nbe inclined to evaluate those stories that
      resemble their own more\\npositively, a phenomenon often studied under the name
      of homophily. Both\\nbias and its specific form of homophily risk undermining
      ongoing\\nattempts to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. The\\npotential
      effects of bias and homophily may potentially be mitigated by\\nunconscious
      bias training, or by assuring reviewer panels are\\nsufficiently diverse in
      terms of gender, ethnic origin, nationality and\\ncareer stages. Again, empirical
      research on these questions would be\\ndesirable. Do bias and homophily occur
      less or more often when using\\nnarrative CVs? Are reviewers more likely to
      call each other out on bias\\nand is unconscious bias training a suitable answer?
      Alternatively, can\\npanels better deal with biases if they cultivate a practice
      making\\nimplicit biases explicit?  \\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left; margin-right:35px;margin-top:8px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3annemijn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"

      Crafting narratives\\n\\nA whole other set of unresolved questions arise even
      before evaluation,\\nnamely in the practice of crafting a narrative. During
      the workshop, we\\nadopted a very broad perspective on representing oneself
      as an academic,\\neven experimenting with the use of AI-generated visualizations
      in CVs\\nthat resulted in [a live\\nexhibition](https://www.np3.nu/resumatic/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      hosted by\\nartists Ruud Akse and Zwaan Ipema in the art space NP3 in Groningen
      (the\\nimages in this blog post have been created during that session). While\\nnarrative
      CV formats currently abstain from any visualization elements,\\nthey do create
      the possibility to frame academic work in ways that\\nhighlight different dimensions
      of contributions. For example, this\\npotentially allows for focusing also on
      desirable but usually somewhat\\nundervalued aspects like actively practicing
      Open Science, communication\\nand engagement with society, teaching, or exerting
      leadership in\\ninnovative ways. And while narrative CVs focus on individual\\nresearchers,
      they principally allow for new ways of showing how\\nindividual researchers
      contribute to collaborative work -- for example,\\nby giving space to account
      for community-building work that does not\\nlead to publications and would normally
      remain invisible. At the same\\ntime, the practice of crafting a narrative is
      also related to\\nsociological power dynamics, for example to the command of
      cultural\\ncapital, which is unequally distributed across researchers in terms
      of\\ndemographic dimensions such as age and social origin. Crafting\\nnarratives
      after all requires much more tacit knowledge about \\\\\\\"how to\\npresent
      yourself\\\\\\\" than a standardized tabular format. In addition,\\ncrafting
      narratives may come easier for some personality types than\\nothers.\\n\\nThe
      prospect of writing a narrative also raises the question of how\\ncoherent the
      biographical account should be. Our workshop featured a\\ngroup work session
      chaired by Catelijne Coopmans in which we took a\\ncritical look at academic
      career advice. Academic career advice\\nresources often appear to help reproduce
      rather traditional assumptions\\nabout what it means to be a successful researcher.
      One of the takeaways\\nwas that the cost of conforming to perceived or real
      career requirements\\n[can be\\nhigh](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nboth
      to building viable livelihoods and to health and wellbeing. Many\\nresearchers
      still work under the assumption that the goal of doing\\nacademic research is
      to become a professor, while other career paths are\\nperceived as a form of
      failure. In reality, \\\"irregular\\\" trajectories may\\nnot just lead to more
      professional fulfillment on the side of the\\nresearcher, but may also have
      unexpected benefits for society (e.g.,\\nwhen academics engage or contribute
      to industry, social organizations,\\nor government). The narrative CV in principle
      allows for showcasing\\ndiverse trajectories through academic research, for
      example in the sense\\nof creating room to document experience working in other
      fields,\\nprofessions, or experimenting with novel methods.\\n\\nA final important
      concern is of course the time required to craft and\\nevaluate narratives, which
      will often be significant. One way of\\nreducing this work is to aim for a degree
      of harmonization of formats\\nacross organizations. Led by the Royal Society,
      efforts to achieve this\\n[are already\\nunderway](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/tools-for-support/resume-for-researchers/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      the UK. A related risk is that narrative CVs could turn into a new\\nbusiness
      opportunity for hired consultants, specialized in crafting\\ncatchy narratives.
      The attempt to \\\"optimize\\\" narrative CVs for\\nparticular funding opportunities
      through such professional support would\\nseem to undermine the intention of
      using new formats to increase the\\ninformational value of CVs, and of course
      it would raise questions about\\nwho has or does not have access to the necessary
      resources for such\\nsupport. Time will tell how researchers will adapt to narrative
      CV\\nformats, and it may be that a critical assessment or change of direction\\nwill
      be required in a few years' time.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:right; margin-left:24px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/3bjorn2_300x300.jpg\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"18292\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Visual CV, created by Bj\xF6rn Hammarfelt.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n###
      A holistic perspective is needed\\n\\nAs this reflection on some of the key
      themes that came up during the\\nworkshop shows, there are lots of opportunities
      but also uncertainties\\nrelated to the recent wave of narrative CV initiatives.
      What is perhaps\\nmost interesting about it is that the current moment stimulates\\nreflection
      on practices of research assessment that are usually taken\\nfor granted. We
      might say that experiments with novel CV formats\\nfunction as a sort of sociological
      breaching experiment, where the\\nfundamentals of our conventional mechanisms
      for distributing science\\nfunding and academic hiring are put up for discussion.
      The breadth of\\nthe questions we raise in this short essay in any case prompts
      us to\\navoid thinking of the introduction of new CV formats as a panacea. CV\\nformats
      are just one element - albeit a particularly important one - in\\na broader
      set of practices of research assessment. Addressing the\\nfoundational problems
      that narrative CV formats are meant to solve will\\nrequire an empirically and
      conceptually well-understood view of the\\nself-reproduction of the scientific
      career system - both in terms of how\\nresearchers plan their careers and present
      themselves strategically for\\nassessment purposes, and in terms of the practical
      functioning of\\nresearch evaluation, as well as the science system as a whole.\\n\\n[[**

      Conference on Science, Technology\nand Innovation Indicators (STI\n2022)](https://sti2022.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      in Granada, Spain, was my\nfirst international trip since I had finished [my
      one-year research stay\nin\nLeiden](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/how-does-a-lockdown-affect-a-visiting-researcher-some-reflections-during-the-period-of-the-covid-19-lockdown){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      come back to Taiwan. When I learned that the STI 2022 conference\nwould be held
      physically, I was very excited about returning to Europe\nand reconnecting with
      the colleagues over there. Due to the\nCovid-measures in place in Taiwan, it
      was not certain from the beginning\nthat I would actually be able to attend
      the conference, but in the end\nit all worked out. I was privileged to attend
      the STI 2022 conference\nand extremely grateful for this opportunity. My trip
      was relatively\nshort, and I did not have much time to enjoy the beautiful scenery
      of\nGranada. People might wonder if attending the conference for less than a\nweek
      was worth traveling here from a faraway country. I did remember one\ncolleague
      asking me this question, and my answer was, \"Yes, definitely.\"\n\n### What
      reconnecting means to me\n\nIt is because I reconnected to the center of the
      bibliometric community\nagain! As a researcher from faraway Asia, I sometimes
      felt lost because\nmany new topics have not yet been discussed at my place.
      Attending the\nSTI conference live again gave me an excellent opportunity to
      follow the\nlatest trends and have face-to-face discussions with my international\npeers.
      For instance, I noticed more and more studies and discussions\nabout open infrastructures
      and new databases like Overton. The topic of\ndiversity has gained more attention,
      with bibliometric analyses\nsupporting policy-making in this area. Triangulating
      quantitative and\nqualitative analyses has become more common. Many interesting
      works\nrelated to funding policy also allowed me to understand the funding\nmechanisms
      in European countries better. I could even get in touch with\nparticipants who
      work at funding organizations. Not to mention that it\nwas great to know who
      else is studying OA publishing and APCs, which is\none of my research interests.\n\nMoreover,
      I made some personal \"breakthroughs\". For instance, it was my\nfirst time
      hosting an STI conference session, my first presentation on\ninternational collaboration,
      and my first time being part of the\nreviewers. I have learned a lot from preparation
      to presentation, which\ngave me more confidence.\n\nBesides that, I also attended
      the first-ever \\\"[*Women in Science Policy\n(WISP)*](https://twitter.com/Women_SciPolicy){target=\"_blank\"}\"
      event at\nthe conference. This was organized by Gemma Derrick, Cassidy R. Sugimoto\nand
      Caroline Wagner,\u00a0who attempted to advocate for acknowledging women\nin
      science policy to relevant stakeholders and to build up the network\nfor female
      researchers to coordinate matches between mentors and\nmentees. All female participants
      from different career stages were\ninvited to attend this event on the first
      day after the reception\ncocktail. The senior female researchers were genuinely
      willing to share\ntheir experiences. When they heard questions from the junior\nresearchers,
      they even would introduce other senior researchers who had\nsimilar backgrounds
      or had encountered similar issues before to juniors.\nFor me, I did get to know
      more female researchers during the WISP event.\nIt was a more relaxed environment
      than the coffee breaks during the\ndaytime. The atmosphere, in general, was
      great. It did create a safe and\nfriendly space without any burden. Usually,
      during coffee breaks, people\nupdate each other on research progress and career
      status, discuss their\nthoughts on the last session or plenary meeting, or introduce
      and\nexchange contact information in a hurry. At the WISP, I felt more\ncomfortable
      asking questions and seeking advice like career planning.\n\nOf course, some
      of these observations and experiences could also have\nbeen achieved via online
      conferences, but the live and immediate\ndiscussions with international peers
      is the most valuable thing. It is\nsomething that is hardly replaced by virtual
      conferences. Real-time and\nphysical conferences provide opportunities for connecting.
      We can\ninteract through more frequent social events like coffee breaks,\nlunches,
      and dinners. It also gives us a more flexible schedule for \"pre\nand post-conference
      activity\" to enhance the connection. Grasping the\nopportunity to explore the
      city on the day before the conference starts\nor extending the happy-hour time
      after the conference ends is a way to\nget to know our colleagues better.\n\n###
      Hybrid conferences -- a compromise? {#hybrid-conferences-a-compromise}\n\nEven
      though online conference formats may hardly replace the real and\nlive interactions
      during physical conferences, attending international\nconferences has its economic
      and environmental costs and may not always\nbe possible or desired. Here is
      where hybrid conferences can be a\nsolution and might even help to ensure inclusion
      and diversity. During\nthe pandemic, organizing a conference in the online format
      let academic\ncommunities get used to the new model of scholarly communication.\n\nBut
      how do we make online experiences as likeable as meeting physically?\nI think
      the most important thing is: people online should not feel left\nout or disconnected.
      Besides some issues with technical equipment or\ninternet connection, we often
      see them being forgotten during\ndiscussions. In that sense, ensuring every
      session host knows how to\nhost hybrid conferences is essential.\n\nRegarding
      social activities, pure online conferences usually rely on\nchatrooms or even
      games to proceed; however, it seems impossible to\nengage people online and
      offline in the same social activities at the\nsame time, for example, having
      a city tour together. This requires\ncreative thinking to come up with approaches
      that make the conference\nexperience enjoyable for both offline and online participants.  \n\n###
      Looking forward to STI 2023\n\nHere I would like to express my gratitude again
      to the organizing\ncommittee of the STI 2022 conference! I really appreciate
      the idea of\ninviting more early career researchers to host sessions and organizing\nthe
      WISP event to provide an excellent opportunity for female\nresearchers to get
      to know each other, engage in conversations, and\nexchange experiences. Now
      I am looking forward to the next one -- [STI\n2023 in Leiden](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\norganizing committee has already [announced that it will be held in a\nhybrid\nway](https://twitter.com/Ednoyons/status/1568535459525001217?t=tRE7p6tYDkBGukYhtP8u_A&s=19){target=\"_blank\"}.\nMoreover,
      the conference motto, \"*improving scholarly evaluation\npractice in the light
      of cultural change,*\" triggers the ambition of\ninnovating the conference format
      as well as the [submission and review\nprocess](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLet\\''s

      the conference, but in the end\\nit all worked out. I was privileged to attend
      the STI 2022 conference\\nand extremely grateful for this opportunity. My trip
      was relatively\\nshort, and I did not have much time to enjoy the beautiful
      scenery of\\nGranada. People might wonder if attending the conference for less
      than a\\nweek was worth traveling here from a faraway country. I did remember
      one\\ncolleague asking me this question, and my answer was, \\\"Yes, definitely.\\\"\\n\\n###
      What reconnecting means to me\\n\\nIt is because I reconnected to the center
      of the bibliometric community\\nagain! As a researcher from faraway Asia, I
      sometimes felt lost because\\nmany new topics have not yet been discussed at
      my place. Attending the\\nSTI conference live again gave me an excellent opportunity
      to follow the\\nlatest trends and have face-to-face discussions with my international\\npeers.
      For instance, I noticed more and more studies and discussions\\nabout open infrastructures
      and new databases like Overton. The topic of\\ndiversity has gained more attention,
      with bibliometric analyses\\nsupporting policy-making in this area. Triangulating
      quantitative and\\nqualitative analyses has become more common. Many interesting
      works\\nrelated to funding policy also allowed me to understand the funding\\nmechanisms
      in European countries better. I could even get in touch with\\nparticipants
      who work at funding organizations. Not to mention that it\\nwas great to know
      who else is studying OA publishing and APCs, which is\\none of my research interests.\\n\\nMoreover,
      I made some personal \\\"breakthroughs\\\". For instance, it was my\\nfirst
      time hosting an STI conference session, my first presentation on\\ninternational
      collaboration, and my first time being part of the\\nreviewers. I have learned
      a lot from preparation to presentation, which\\ngave me more confidence.\\n\\nBesides
      that, I also attended the first-ever \\\\\\\"[*Women in Science Policy\\n(WISP)*](https://twitter.com/Women_SciPolicy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\"
      event at\\nthe conference. This was organized by Gemma Derrick, Cassidy R. Sugimoto\\nand
      Caroline Wagner,\_who attempted to advocate for acknowledging women\\nin science
      policy to relevant stakeholders and to build up the network\\nfor female researchers
      to coordinate matches between mentors and\\nmentees. All female participants
      from different career stages were\\ninvited to attend this event on the first
      day after the reception\\ncocktail. The senior female researchers were genuinely
      willing to share\\ntheir experiences. When they heard questions from the junior\\nresearchers,
      they even would introduce other senior researchers who had\\nsimilar backgrounds
      or had encountered similar issues before to juniors.\\nFor me, I did get to
      know more female researchers during the WISP event.\\nIt was a more relaxed
      environment than the coffee breaks during the\\ndaytime. The atmosphere, in
      general, was great. It did create a safe and\\nfriendly space without any burden.
      Usually, during coffee breaks, people\\nupdate each other on research progress
      and career status, discuss their\\nthoughts on the last session or plenary meeting,
      or introduce and\\nexchange contact information in a hurry. At the WISP, I felt
      more\\ncomfortable asking questions and seeking advice like career planning.\\n\\nOf
      course, some of these observations and experiences could also have\\nbeen achieved
      via online conferences, but the live and immediate\\ndiscussions with international
      peers is the most valuable thing. It is\\nsomething that is hardly replaced
      by virtual conferences. Real-time and\\nphysical conferences provide opportunities
      for connecting. We can\\ninteract through more frequent social events like coffee
      breaks,\\nlunches, and dinners. It also gives us a more flexible schedule for
      \\\"pre\\nand post-conference activity\\\" to enhance the connection. Grasping
      the\\nopportunity to explore the city on the day before the conference starts\\nor
      extending the happy-hour time after the conference ends is a way to\\nget to
      know our colleagues better.\\n\\n### Hybrid conferences -- a compromise? {#hybrid-conferences-a-compromise}\\n\\nEven
      though online conference formats may hardly replace the real and\\nlive interactions
      during physical conferences, attending international\\nconferences has its economic
      and environmental costs and may not always\\nbe possible or desired. Here is
      where hybrid conferences can be a\\nsolution and might even help to ensure inclusion
      and diversity. During\\nthe pandemic, organizing a conference in the online
      format let academic\\ncommunities get used to the new model of scholarly communication.\\n\\nBut
      how do we make online experiences as likeable as meeting physically?\\nI think
      the most important thing is: people online should not feel left\\nout or disconnected.
      Besides some issues with technical equipment or\\ninternet connection, we often
      see them being forgotten during\\ndiscussions. In that sense, ensuring every
      session host knows how to\\nhost hybrid conferences is essential.\\n\\nRegarding
      social activities, pure online conferences usually rely on\\nchatrooms or even
      games to proceed; however, it seems impossible to\\nengage people online and
      offline in the same social activities at the\\nsame time, for example, having
      a city tour together. This requires\\ncreative thinking to come up with approaches
      that make the conference\\nexperience enjoyable for both offline and online
      participants.  \\n\\n### Looking forward to STI 2023\\n\\nHere I would like
      to express my gratitude again to the organizing\\ncommittee of the STI 2022
      conference! I really appreciate the idea of\\ninviting more early career researchers
      to host sessions and organizing\\nthe WISP event to provide an excellent opportunity
      for female\\nresearchers to get to know each other, engage in conversations,

      "leidenmadtrics", "content_text": "The adoption of open science practices has
      become a prominent topic of\nstudy for the science studies community. However,
      the research practices\nof the community itself are still quite traditional.
      While open access\npublishing, preprinting, open peer review, open data sharing,
      and other\nopen science practices are gradually becoming more common in the
      science\nstudies community, the adoption of these practices is still at a\nrelatively
      low level.\n\nGiven the community''s deep understanding of the research system,
      we\nthink we should be able to do a better job. As organizers of this year''s\n[Science,
      Technology and Innovation Indicators conference (STI\n2023)](https://sti2023.org){target=\"_blank\"},
      we therefore introduce two\nopen science experiments: We adopt a new publication
      and peer review\nprocess, fully aligned with state-of-the-art open science practices,
      and\nwe invite authors of contributions submitted to the conference to\nreflect
      on their own open science practices.  \n\n### Experiment 1: Opening the publication
      and peer review process\n\nIn earlier editions of the STI conference, contributions
      submitted to\nthe conference were reviewed in a traditional closed peer review\nprocess.
      Contributions accepted for presentation at the conference were\npublished in
      the conference proceedings while those not accepted for\npresentation were not
      published.\n\nFor the STI 2023 conference, we are going to experiment with an
      open\n''publish, then review'' model as an alternative to the closed ''review,\nthen
      publish'' approach. The publication and peer review process will be\norganized
      as follows:  \n\n- The conference will use a submission and publication platform
      provided\n  by [Orvium](https://orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"}. *All contributions\n  submitted
      to the conference will immediately be published as a\n  preprint on the platform.*
      Contributions will be openly accessible\n  under a CC-BY license. Authors will
      retain their copyright. Each\n  contribution will have its own DOI.\n\n<!--
      -->\n\n- The conference will organize an open peer review process. *For each\n  contribution
      submitted to the conference, the reviews will be\n  published on the Orvium
      platform and will be linked to the preprint\n  version of the contribution.*
      Reviewers will be encouraged to disclose\n  their identity, but they may also
      choose to remain anonymous. Authors\n  will be invited to update their contribution
      based on the feedback\n  provided by reviewers. The updated contribution will
      also be published\n  on the Orvium platform.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- As conference
      organizers, *we will use the peer review results to\n  select contributions
      for presentation at the conference.* All\n  contributions will remain available
      on the Orvium platform, both the\n  contributions selected for presentation
      and those not selected.\n\nFurther information about the publication and peer
      review process of the\nSTI 2023 conference can be found in the [call for\npapers](https://www.sti2023.org/call-for-papers/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\n''publish, then review'' model that we are going to use at the conference\nis
      inspired by platforms such as\n[*F1000Research*](https://f1000research.com/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[*eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83889){target=\"_blank\"},
      and\n[*Peer Community In*](https://peercommunityin.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      [combine preprinting and open peer\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg2283){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n**Expected
      benefits**\n\nCompared with the publication and peer review process in earlier\neditions
      of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits in our new\napproach:  \n\n-
      *Accelerating the dissemination of new scientific knowledge.* The\n  immediate
      publication of conference contributions as preprints will\n  speed up the dissemination
      of new scientific knowledge. Interested\n  researchers and practitioners will
      have access to the latest\n  scientific findings without waiting for the conference
      to take place.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Increasing the value of peer review.* In the
      traditional closed peer\n  review model used in earlier editions of the STI
      conference, reviews\n  were made available only to the authors of a conference
      contribution\n  and to the conference organizers. In our new open peer review
      model,\n  reviews will also be made available to the readers of a conference\n  contribution,
      helping readers to develop a more informed understanding\n  of the strengths
      and weaknesses of a contribution, also the ones not\n  selected for presentation.
      This will increase the value of the\n  reviews.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Giving more
      recognition to authors.* The immediate publication of\n  conference contributions
      as preprints will enable authors to get\n  feedback and credit more rapidly.\n\n<!--
      -->\n\n- *Giving more recognition to reviewers.* In the traditional closed peer\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers\n  hardly got
      any credit for their work. In our new open peer review\n  model, reviewers who
      choose to disclose their identity will get public\n  recognition.\n\n**Potential
      concerns**\n\nWe recognize that the publication and peer review process of the
      STI\n2023 conference may also raise concerns. A common objection against\npreprinting
      is that preprints may present inaccurate results because\nthey are published
      before peer review. While results presented in\npreprints may indeed be inaccurate,
      the same applies to results reported\nin peer-reviewed articles, since peer
      review usually does not resolve\nall inaccuracies in an article. We also note
      that the reviews that will\nbe published alongside the preprinted conference
      contributions will help\nreaders to assess the quality of a contribution. Another
      concern about\npreprinting is that journals might be reluctant to publish articles
      that\nhave already been published as a preprint. However, very few journals\nstill
      have such a policy.\n\nA common concern about open peer review is that criticism
      provided by\nreviewers may be incorrect or even offensive. As conference organizers,\nwe
      call on reviewers to give constructive and respectful feedback, for\ninstance
      by following the [FAST (focused, appropriate, specific,\ntransparent)\nprinciples](https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      reserve the right to moderate reviews that we regard as\ndisrespectful. If the
      authors of a conference contribution consider\ncriticism provided by a reviewer
      to be incorrect, they will have the\npossibility to publish a response in which
      they explain why they\ndisagree with the reviewer. Authors will also be able
      to update their\nconference contribution to address problems identified by reviewers.\n\nWe
      appreciate that special consideration needs to be given to the\ninterests of
      PhD students and other researchers who find themselves in\nvulnerable positions.
      These researchers may be disproportionately\naffected by the drawbacks of the
      way publication and peer review\nprocesses are organized. In a closed ''review,
      then publish'' model, peer\nreview may be biased against these researchers,
      lowering their chances\nof getting their work published. In an open ''publish,
      then review''\nmodel, these researchers may feel uncomfortable both about their
      own\nwork being critiqued publicly and about publicly critiquing the work of\nothers,
      in particular the work of more senior colleagues. In the\nevaluation of our
      new approach to publication and peer review (see\nbelow), we will pay special
      attention to the experiences of PhD students\nand other researchers in vulnerable
      positions.\n\n### Experiment 2: Reflecting on open science practices\n\nAs organizers
      of the STI 2023 conference, we strongly encourage authors\nof contributions
      submitted to the conference to adopt open science\npractices in their work.
      At the same time, we recognize that there may\nbe barriers to the adoption of
      such practices, including for instance\nreliance on proprietary data sources,
      legal or ethical concerns, and\nlack of experience with open science practices.
      Rather than introducing\nformal open science requirements, we therefore take
      a more experimental\napproach. We invite authors of conference contributions
      to explicitly\nreflect on their own open science practices.\n\n*Each contribution
      submitted to the conference is expected to include a\nshort section in which
      the authors reflect on the use of open science\npractices in the research presented
      in their contribution.*Authors may\nfor instance discuss the openness of the
      data used in their research. If\nthe data is openly available, the authors can
      explain how the data can\nbe obtained. If the data is not openly available,
      the authors can\nexplain why they do not use openly available data or why they
      are unable\nto make their data openly available. Openness of software and source\ncodes
      can be discussed in a similar way. Authors may also discuss\nwhether a research
      plan was made openly available at the start of their\nresearch (''preregistration'')
      or whether any intermediate results of the\nresearch have already been published,
      for instance in a preprint.\n\nWe hope this experiment will increase the awareness
      and adoption of open\nscience practices in the science studies community. In
      addition, the\nexperiment may also help organizers of future conferences to
      better\nunderstand how the adoption of open science practices can be facilitated\nand
      promoted.  \n\n### Evaluating the experiments\n\nThe above two experiments will
      hopefully provide an additional\nmotivation to colleagues in the science studies
      community to submit\ntheir work to our conference. We are eager to see how the
      experiments\nwill work out. After the conference, we will invite conference\nparticipants
      to fill in a survey to evaluate the experiments. The\noutcomes of the evaluation
      will be reported in a blog post. In the\nmeantime, if you have any questions
      about the experiments, or any\nfeedback you would like to share, don''t hesitate
      to [contact\nus](mailto:sti2023@cwts.leidenuniv.nl).\n\nLooking forward to meeting

      itself are still quite traditional. While open access\npublishing, preprinting,
      open peer review, open data sharing, and other\nopen science practices are gradually
      becoming more common in the science\nstudies community, the adoption of these
      practices is still at a\nrelatively low level.\n\nGiven the community''s deep
      understanding of the research system, we\nthink we should be able to do a better
      job. As organizers of this year''s\n[Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators
      conference (STI\n2023)](https://sti2023.org){target=\"_blank\"}, we therefore
      introduce two\nopen science experiments: We adopt a new publication and peer
      review\nprocess, fully aligned with state-of-the-art open science practices,
      and\nwe invite authors of contributions submitted to the conference to\nreflect
      on their own open science practices.  \n\n### Experiment 1: Opening the publication
      and peer review process\n\nIn earlier editions of the STI conference, contributions
      submitted to\nthe conference were reviewed in a traditional closed peer review\nprocess.
      Contributions accepted for presentation at the conference were\npublished in
      the conference proceedings while those not accepted for\npresentation were not
      published.\n\nFor the STI 2023 conference, we are going to experiment with an
      open\n''publish, then review'' model as an alternative to the closed ''review,\nthen
      publish'' approach. The publication and peer review process will be\norganized
      as follows:  \n\n- The conference will use a submission and publication platform
      provided\n  by [Orvium](https://orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"}. *All contributions\n  submitted
      to the conference will immediately be published as a\n  preprint on the platform.*
      Contributions will be openly accessible\n  under a CC-BY license. Authors will
      retain their copyright. Each\n  contribution will have its own DOI.\n\n<!--
      -->\n\n- The conference will organize an open peer review process. *For each\n  contribution
      submitted to the conference, the reviews will be\n  published on the Orvium
      platform and will be linked to the preprint\n  version of the contribution.*
      Reviewers will be encouraged to disclose\n  their identity, but they may also
      choose to remain anonymous. Authors\n  will be invited to update their contribution
      based on the feedback\n  provided by reviewers. The updated contribution will
      also be published\n  on the Orvium platform.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- As conference
      organizers, *we will use the peer review results to\n  select contributions
      for presentation at the conference.* All\n  contributions will remain available
      on the Orvium platform, both the\n  contributions selected for presentation
      and those not selected.\n\nFurther information about the publication and peer
      review process of the\nSTI 2023 conference can be found in the [call for\npapers](https://www.sti2023.org/call-for-papers/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\n''publish, then review'' model that we are going to use at the conference\nis
      inspired by platforms such as\n[*F1000Research*](https://f1000research.com/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[*eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83889){target=\"_blank\"},
      and\n[*Peer Community In*](https://peercommunityin.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      [combine preprinting and open peer\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg2283){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n**Expected
      benefits**\n\nCompared with the publication and peer review process in earlier\neditions
      of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits in our new\napproach:  \n\n-
      *Accelerating the dissemination of new scientific knowledge.* The\n  immediate
      publication of conference contributions as preprints will\n  speed up the dissemination
      of new scientific knowledge. Interested\n  researchers and practitioners will
      have access to the latest\n  scientific findings without waiting for the conference
      to take place.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Increasing the value of peer review.* In the
      traditional closed peer\n  review model used in earlier editions of the STI
      conference, reviews\n  were made available only to the authors of a conference
      contribution\n  and to the conference organizers. In our new open peer review
      model,\n  reviews will also be made available to the readers of a conference\n  contribution,
      helping readers to develop a more informed understanding\n  of the strengths
      and weaknesses of a contribution, also the ones not\n  selected for presentation.
      This will increase the value of the\n  reviews.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Giving more
      recognition to authors.* The immediate publication of\n  conference contributions
      as preprints will enable authors to get\n  feedback and credit more rapidly.\n\n<!--
      -->\n\n- *Giving more recognition to reviewers.* In the traditional closed peer\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers\n  hardly got
      any credit for their work. In our new open peer review\n  model, reviewers who
      choose to disclose their identity will get public\n  recognition.\n\n**Potential

      of the STI conference, we see a number of benefits in our new\napproach:  \n\n-
      *Accelerating the dissemination of new scientific knowledge.* The\n  immediate
      publication of conference contributions as preprints will\n  speed up the dissemination
      of new scientific knowledge. Interested\n  researchers and practitioners will
      have access to the latest\n  scientific findings without waiting for the conference
      to take place.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Increasing the value of peer review.* In the
      traditional closed peer\n  review model used in earlier editions of the STI
      conference, reviews\n  were made available only to the authors of a conference
      contribution\n  and to the conference organizers. In our new open peer review
      model,\n  reviews will also be made available to the readers of a conference\n  contribution,
      helping readers to develop a more informed understanding\n  of the strengths
      and weaknesses of a contribution, also the ones not\n  selected for presentation.
      This will increase the value of the\n  reviews.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n- *Giving more
      recognition to authors.* The immediate publication of\n  conference contributions
      as preprints will enable authors to get\n  feedback and credit more rapidly.\n\n<!--
      -->\n\n- *Giving more recognition to reviewers.* In the traditional closed peer\n  review
      model used in earlier editions of the STI conference, reviewers\n  hardly got
      any credit for their work. In our new open peer review\n  model, reviewers who
      choose to disclose their identity will get public\n  recognition.\n\n**Potential
      concerns**\n\nWe recognize that the publication and peer review process of the
      STI\n2023 conference may also raise concerns. A common objection against\npreprinting
      is that preprints may present inaccurate results because\nthey are published
      before peer review. While results presented in\npreprints may indeed be inaccurate,
      the same applies to results reported\nin peer-reviewed articles, since peer
      review usually does not resolve\nall inaccuracies in an article. We also note
      that the reviews that will\nbe published alongside the preprinted conference
      contributions will help\nreaders to assess the quality of a contribution. Another
      concern about\npreprinting is that journals might be reluctant to publish articles
      that\nhave already been published as a preprint. However, very few journals\nstill
      have such a policy.\n\nA common concern about open peer review is that criticism
      provided by\nreviewers may be incorrect or even offensive. As conference organizers,\nwe
      call on reviewers to give constructive and respectful feedback, for\ninstance
      by following the [FAST (focused, appropriate, specific,\ntransparent)\nprinciples](https://asapbio.org/fast-principles-for-preprint-feedback){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      reserve the right to moderate reviews that we regard as\ndisrespectful. If the
      authors of a conference contribution consider\ncriticism provided by a reviewer
      to be incorrect, they will have the\npossibility to publish a response in which
      they explain why they\ndisagree with the reviewer. Authors will also be able
      to update their\nconference contribution to address problems identified by reviewers.\n\nWe
      appreciate that special consideration needs to be given to the\ninterests of
      PhD students and other researchers who find themselves in\nvulnerable positions.
      These researchers may be disproportionately\naffected by the drawbacks of the
      way publication and peer review\nprocesses are organized. In a closed ''review,
      then publish'' model, peer\nreview may be biased against these researchers,
      lowering their chances\nof getting their work published. In an open ''publish,
      then review''\nmodel, these researchers may feel uncomfortable both about their
      own\nwork being critiqued publicly and about publicly critiquing the work of\nothers,
      in particular the work of more senior colleagues. In the\nevaluation of our
      new approach to publication and peer review (see\nbelow), we will pay special
      attention to the experiences of PhD students\nand other researchers in vulnerable
      positions.\n\n### Experiment 2: Reflecting on open science practices\n\nAs organizers
      of the STI 2023 conference, we strongly encourage authors\nof contributions
      submitted to the conference to adopt open science\npractices in their work.
      At the same time, we recognize that there may\nbe barriers to the adoption of
      such practices, including for instance\nreliance on proprietary data sources,
      legal or ethical concerns, and\nlack of experience with open science practices.
      Rather than introducing\nformal open science requirements, we therefore take
      a more experimental\napproach. We invite authors of conference contributions
      to explicitly\nreflect on their own open science practices.\n\n*Each contribution
      submitted to the conference is expected to include a\nshort section in which
      the authors reflect on the use of open science\npractices in the research presented
      in their contribution.*Authors may\nfor instance discuss the openness of the
      data used in their research. If\nthe data is openly available, the authors can
      explain how the data can\nbe obtained. If the data is not openly available,
      the authors can\nexplain why they do not use openly available data or why they
      are unable\nto make their data openly available. Openness of software and source\ncodes
      can be discussed in a similar way. Authors may also discuss\nwhether a research
      plan was made openly available at the start of their\nresearch (''preregistration'')
      or whether any intermediate results of the\nresearch have already been published,
      for instance in a preprint.\n\nWe hope this experiment will increase the awareness
      and adoption of open\nscience practices in the science studies community. In
      addition, the\nexperiment may also help organizers of future conferences to
      better\nunderstand how the adoption of open science practices can be facilitated\nand
      promoted.  \n\n### Evaluating the experiments\n\nThe above two experiments will
      hopefully provide an additional\nmotivation to colleagues in the science studies
      community to submit\ntheir work to our conference. We are eager to see how the
      experiments\nwill work out. After the conference, we will invite conference\nparticipants
      to fill in a survey to evaluate the experiments. The\noutcomes of the evaluation
      will be reported in a blog post. In the\nmeantime, if you have any questions
      about the experiments, or any\nfeedback you would like to share, don''t hesitate
      to [contact\nus](mailto:sti2023@cwts.leidenuniv.nl).\n\nLooking forward to meeting
      you at STI 2023!  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      gives an introduction to RRA and discusses how to\nnavigate RRA guidelines,
      which can be a complex task.\n\n### What is Responsible Research Assessment
      (RRA)?\n\nA search for definitions of RRA resulted in:\n\n- [\\\"Responsible
      metrics as a way of framing appropriate uses of\n  quantitative indicators in
      the governance, management and assessment\n  of\n  research\\\"](https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/){target=\"_blank\"}\n-
      [\\\"Responsible research evaluation focuses on producing research\n  metrics

      RRA [\\\"is an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which\n  incentivise,
      reflect and reward the plural characteristics of\n  high-quality research, in
      support of diverse and inclusive research\n  cultures.\\\"](https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nTwo
      definitions focus on principles for working with metrics, and the\nthird on
      supporting diverse and inclusive research culture through\nresearch assessment.
      All are valid, and one unifying definition is still\nlacking. Also, the terminology
      varies. Assessment and evaluation or\nmetrics and indicators are used interchangeably.\n\nIt
      can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what RRA is and getting an\noverview of
      RRA is equally complex. One approach, however, is RRA\nguidelines that explain
      RRA and guide its implementation. Some\ninternationally well-known RRA guidelines
      are: [San Francisco\nDeclaration on Research Assessment\n(DORA)](https://sfdora.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [Leiden\nManifesto](https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a){target=\"_blank\"}, [Hong
      Kong\nPrinciples](https://www.wcrif.org/guidance/hong-kong-principles){target=\"_blank\"},\nand\n[SCOPE](https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nA
      common starting point for RRA and its guidelines is that traditional\nquantitative
      research assessment and its emphasis on bibliometric\nindicators may be easy
      to apply but has many biases. Criticism of\ntraditional indicators is seen,
      for example, in DORA leading to the\nrecommendation not to use Journal Impact
      Factors for research funding,\nappointment, and promotion considerations.\n\nTraditional
      quantitative research assessment is indicator- or\ndata-driven, meaning that
      popular indicators---for example the Journal\nImpact Factor---or easily available
      data are the staring points of\nassessments. Instead, RRA focuses on the entity
      to be assessed and\nstarts with what seems to be lacking in the traditional
      quantitative\nresearch assessments, for example, the values (cf. SCOPE), or
      the\nresearch integrity (cf. Hong Kong Principles) of the entity to be\nassessed.\n\n###
      Who use RRA guidelines?\n\nUniversities'' adoption of RRA guidelines is relatively
      new, and [many\nuniversities use DORA or Leiden Manifesto, sometimes to develop
      local\nRRA\npolicies](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/results-from-the-2021-responsible-metrics-state-of-the-art-survey/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is possible to endorse DORA and Hong Kong Principles at their\nwebsites, and
      the long lists of signatories show that not only\nuniversities but also other
      institutions from the research sector\nsupport RRA, for example, funders, publishers,
      learned societies,\ngovernmental agencies, etc. Also, individuals are among
      the signatories.\n\nRRA guidelines are not only relevant at the individual,
      local, and\nnational level. The European Commission has published an agreement
      on\nhow to reform research assessment. [The RRA guidelines contribute to the\nbasis
      for the reform, and the guidelines are among the tools for the\npractical implementation
      of the\nreform](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      What are the scopes of RRA guidelines?\n\nFor institutions or individuals new
      to RRA, it can be difficult to\nnavigate the guidelines. Which guidelines are
      relevant? What are the\nscopes of the guidelines? How are the guidelines applied?
      Etc.\n\nTo answer these questions, [the Evaluation Checklists Project Charter\nand
      its Criteria for Evaluation\nChecklists](https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      useful. The criteria are developed by experts from evaluation\nresearch with
      the mission to \"advance excellence in evaluation by\nproviding high-quality
      checklists to guide practice\" and the vision \"for\nall evaluators to have
      the information they need to provide exceptional\nevaluation service and advance
      the public good\".\n\nUsing the criteria *RRA guideline addresses one or more
      specific\nevaluation tasks* and *RRA guideline clarifies or simplifies complex\ncontent
      to guide performance of evaluation tasks*, it becomes apparent\nthat the four
      guidelines mentioned earlier differ in their scopes: SCOPE\naims to improve
      the assessment process, Hong Kong Principles wants to\nstrengthen research integrity,
      Leiden Manifesto stresses accountability\nin metrics-based research assessment,
      and DORA focuses on assessment of\nresearch publications but also other types
      of output. (See also [this\nposter from the Nordic Workshop on Bibliometrics
      and Research\nPolicy](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/87075445/Poster_NW2022_Bruun_Gauffriau.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\n###
      How easy are RRA guidelines to use?\n\nAbove it is shown that the first criteria
      can help understand the scope\nof a RRA guideline. Whether a guideline is easy
      to use may be addressed\nby the next sections of Criteria for Evaluation Checklists:
      *Clarity of\nPurpose*, *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*, *Clarity
      of\nWriting*, and *References and Sources*.\n\nEspecially, the criteria on *Clarity
      of Purpose* address how to use a\nchecklist. Not all four RRA guidelines discussed
      here are clear on all\nof these criteria, i.e., the process of applying the
      guidelines instead\nof simply the result of using the guidelines. Here are some
      examples of\nhow to meet these criteria and, thus, help the user applying the\nguideline:\n\nSCOPE
      discusses the criterion *The circumstances in which it \\[the\nguideline\\]
      should be used* and concludes that research assessment and,\nthus, the use of
      SCOPE is not always the right solution. Assessment is\nnot recommended to incentivize
      specific behaviours. For example, open\naccess publishing would benefit more
      from making it easy for a\nresearcher to comply than from measuring the researcher''s
      share of open\naccess publications.\n\nDORA addresses the criterion *Intended
      users*. The sections in the\nguideline mention intended users. The users are
      funding agencies,\nresearch institutions, publishers, organizations that supply
      metrics,\nand researchers.\n\nLeiden Manifesto and Hong Kong Principles, respectively,
      have relatively\nclear purposes because of their delimited scopes; accountability
      in\nmetrics-based research assessment and strengthen research integrity.\n\nThe
      criteria sections *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*,\n*Clarity of
      Writing*, and *References and Sources* further review how\nwell a guideline
      supports the RRA process. For example, the four\nguidelines provide illustrative
      examples and cases, but all aspects of\nan assessment task are not necessarily
      covered. And the guidelines are\norganized in sections, but it is not always
      clear how this organization\nsupports the RRA process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRRA
      does not have a clear definition, and RRA guidelines can be\ndifficult to apply.
      The Criteria for Evaluation Checklists provides a\ntool developed by evaluation
      researchers that can help users choose\nrelevant RRA guidelines for their work.
      Applying the understanding of\nRRA guidelines constituted by the Evaluation
      Checklists Project Charter\nmay also facilitate a systematic analysis of RRA
      guidelines that could\nlead to a clearer definition of RRA.\n\n### ~Acknowledgements~\n\n~This

      its Criteria for Evaluation\nChecklists](https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      useful. The criteria are developed by experts from evaluation\nresearch with
      the mission to \"advance excellence in evaluation by\nproviding high-quality
      checklists to guide practice\" and the vision \"for\nall evaluators to have
      the information they need to provide exceptional\nevaluation service and advance
      the public good\".\n\nUsing the criteria *RRA guideline addresses one or more
      specific\nevaluation tasks* and *RRA guideline clarifies or simplifies complex\ncontent
      to guide performance of evaluation tasks*, it becomes apparent\nthat the four
      guidelines mentioned earlier differ in their scopes: SCOPE\naims to improve
      the assessment process, Hong Kong Principles wants to\nstrengthen research integrity,
      Leiden Manifesto stresses accountability\nin metrics-based research assessment,
      and DORA focuses on assessment of\nresearch publications but also other types
      of output. (See also [this\nposter from the Nordic Workshop on Bibliometrics
      and Research\nPolicy](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/87075445/Poster_NW2022_Bruun_Gauffriau.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\n###
      How easy are RRA guidelines to use?\n\nAbove it is shown that the first criteria
      can help understand the scope\nof a RRA guideline. Whether a guideline is easy
      to use may be addressed\nby the next sections of Criteria for Evaluation Checklists:
      *Clarity of\nPurpose*, *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*, *Clarity
      of\nWriting*, and *References and Sources*.\n\nEspecially, the criteria on *Clarity
      of Purpose* address how to use a\nchecklist. Not all four RRA guidelines discussed
      here are clear on all\nof these criteria, i.e., the process of applying the
      guidelines instead\nof simply the result of using the guidelines. Here are some
      examples of\nhow to meet these criteria and, thus, help the user applying the\nguideline:\n\nSCOPE
      discusses the criterion *The circumstances in which it \\[the\nguideline\\]
      should be used* and concludes that research assessment and,\nthus, the use of
      SCOPE is not always the right solution. Assessment is\nnot recommended to incentivize
      specific behaviours. For example, open\naccess publishing would benefit more
      from making it easy for a\nresearcher to comply than from measuring the researcher''s
      share of open\naccess publications.\n\nDORA addresses the criterion *Intended
      users*. The sections in the\nguideline mention intended users. The users are
      funding agencies,\nresearch institutions, publishers, organizations that supply
      metrics,\nand researchers.\n\nLeiden Manifesto and Hong Kong Principles, respectively,
      have relatively\nclear purposes because of their delimited scopes; accountability
      in\nmetrics-based research assessment and strengthen research integrity.\n\nThe
      criteria sections *Completeness and Relevance*, *Organization*,\n*Clarity of
      Writing*, and *References and Sources* further review how\nwell a guideline
      supports the RRA process. For example, the four\nguidelines provide illustrative
      examples and cases, but all aspects of\nan assessment task are not necessarily
      covered. And the guidelines are\norganized in sections, but it is not always
      clear how this organization\nsupports the RRA process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRRA
      does not have a clear definition, and RRA guidelines can be\ndifficult to apply.
      The Criteria for Evaluation Checklists provides a\ntool developed by evaluation
      researchers that can help users choose\nrelevant RRA guidelines for their work.
      Applying the understanding of\nRRA guidelines constituted by the Evaluation
      Checklists Project Charter\nmay also facilitate a systematic analysis of RRA
      guidelines that could\nlead to a clearer definition of RRA.\n\n### ~Acknowledgements~\n\n~This

      agenda gaining attention\ntoday. The blog post gives an introduction to RRA
      and discusses how to\nnavigate RRA guidelines, which can be a complex task.\n\n###
      What is Responsible Research Assessment (RRA)?\n\nA search for definitions of
      RRA resulted in:\n\n- [\\\"Responsible metrics as a way of framing appropriate
      uses of\n  quantitative indicators in the governance, management and assessment\n  of\n  research\\\"](https://www.ukri.org/publications/review-of-metrics-in-research-assessment-and-management/){target=\"_blank\"}\n-
      [\\\"Responsible research evaluation focuses on producing research\n  metrics
      that adhere to certain principles, such as data accuracy,\n  transparent data
      collection and analysis or making use of a diversity\n  of\n  indicators.\\\"](http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-7998-2181-6.ch003){target=\"_blank\"}\n-
      RRA [\\\"is an umbrella term for approaches to assessment which\n  incentivise,
      reflect and reward the plural characteristics of\n  high-quality research, in
      support of diverse and inclusive research\n  cultures.\\\"](https://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_changing_role_of_funders_in_responsible_research_assessment_progress_obstacles_and_the_way_ahead/13227914){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nTwo
      definitions focus on principles for working with metrics, and the\nthird on
      supporting diverse and inclusive research culture through\nresearch assessment.
      All are valid, and one unifying definition is still\nlacking. Also, the terminology
      varies. Assessment and evaluation or\nmetrics and indicators are used interchangeably.\n\nIt
      can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what RRA is and getting an\noverview of
      RRA is equally complex. One approach, however, is RRA\nguidelines that explain
      RRA and guide its implementation. Some\ninternationally well-known RRA guidelines
      are: [San Francisco\nDeclaration on Research Assessment\n(DORA)](https://sfdora.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [Leiden\nManifesto](https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a){target=\"_blank\"}, [Hong
      Kong\nPrinciples](https://www.wcrif.org/guidance/hong-kong-principles){target=\"_blank\"},\nand\n[SCOPE](https://inorms.net/scope-framework-for-research-evaluation/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nA
      common starting point for RRA and its guidelines is that traditional\nquantitative
      research assessment and its emphasis on bibliometric\nindicators may be easy
      to apply but has many biases. Criticism of\ntraditional indicators is seen,
      for example, in DORA leading to the\nrecommendation not to use Journal Impact
      Factors for research funding,\nappointment, and promotion considerations.\n\nTraditional
      quantitative research assessment is indicator- or\ndata-driven, meaning that
      popular indicators---for example the Journal\nImpact Factor---or easily available
      data are the staring points of\nassessments. Instead, RRA focuses on the entity
      to be assessed and\nstarts with what seems to be lacking in the traditional
      quantitative\nresearch assessments, for example, the values (cf. SCOPE), or
      the\nresearch integrity (cf. Hong Kong Principles) of the entity to be\nassessed.\n\n###
      Who use RRA guidelines?\n\nUniversities'' adoption of RRA guidelines is relatively
      new, and [many\nuniversities use DORA or Leiden Manifesto, sometimes to develop
      local\nRRA\npolicies](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/results-from-the-2021-responsible-metrics-state-of-the-art-survey/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is possible to endorse DORA and Hong Kong Principles at their\nwebsites, and
      the long lists of signatories show that not only\nuniversities but also other
      institutions from the research sector\nsupport RRA, for example, funders, publishers,
      learned societies,\ngovernmental agencies, etc. Also, individuals are among
      the signatories.\n\nRRA guidelines are not only relevant at the individual,
      local, and\nnational level. The European Commission has published an agreement
      on\nhow to reform research assessment. [The RRA guidelines contribute to the\nbasis
      for the reform, and the guidelines are among the tools for the\npractical implementation
      of the\nreform](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      What are the scopes of RRA guidelines?\n\nFor institutions or individuals new
      to RRA, it can be difficult to\nnavigate the guidelines. Which guidelines are
      relevant? What are the\nscopes of the guidelines? How are the guidelines applied?
      Etc.\n\nTo answer these questions, [the Evaluation Checklists Project Charter\nand
      its Criteria for Evaluation\nChecklists](https://wmich.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/u350/2019/EvalChecklistsProject-Charter.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nis

      its contents with those of other encyclopaedias are long gone,\nalthough the
      perception from [academia was more\noptimistic](https://doi.org/10.1038/438900a){target=\"_blank\"}.
      However,\nin education, the terrain in which this platform is most valuable,
      [the\ncontroversy is\ngreater](https://doi.org/10.7557/13.2377){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Its\nestablished use among students collides completely with the sceptical\nperception
      of part of the teachers. Despite this, there are more and\nmore voices in favour
      of its use, as well as an increasing number of\n[educational\nprojects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:School_and_university_projects)\nthat
      integrate it into the classroom. This conflict has yet to be\nresolved, although
      the general perception has progressively improved\nover time.\n\nIn the case
      of scientometrics, its community has been studying the\npresence of science
      on Wikipedia since before the formal [birth of\n''altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/)''.
      In most cases, however,\nthese previous studies have mostly focused on the analysis
      of the\nscientific works mentioned on Wikipedia, rather than taking Wikipedia\nitself
      as their main research object. This science-centric focus\ntypically overlooks
      the potential of exploring the different\nrelationships that Wikipedia has (or
      doesn''t have) with science. In this\npost I reflect about such potential by
      presenting five key facts about\nthe nature of Wikipedia and its possibilities
      as a research source for\nthe study of science-society interactions.\n\n###
      **1) Why are scientific publications cited on Wikipedia?** {#why-are-scientific-publications-cited-on-wikipedia}\n\nThe
      most common critique of Wikipedia has to do with the reliability of\nits contents,
      a problem that Wikipedia itself [exhibits with complete\ntransparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      its quest for reliability, Wikipedia places great importance on\n[verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      is one of its [core content\npolicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThere
      are several issues in these content policy guidelines that cannot\nbe overlooked
      when studying Wikipedia citations to scientific\npublications. Firstly, Wikipedia
      is an encyclopaedia. It may seem\nobvious, but as stated in its content policy
      guidelines, \\\"*Wikipedia\ndoes not publish* [*original\nresearch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research){target=\"_blank\"}\\\".\nMoreover,
      Wikipedia only publishes information of [encyclopaedic\nrelevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSecondly,
      not all sources are valid as citations on Wikipedia. At the\ntop of the [list
      of source\ntypologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources){target=\"_blank\"}\nrecommended
      by Wikipedia are peer-reviewed scientific publications.\n[Books are one of the
      most relevant\nmaterials](https://doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-06-2018-0152){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThis
      relevance of books for Wikipedia has even led publishers to offer\nfree access
      to their collections to Wikipedia editors via proposals such\nas [The Wikipedia\nLibrary](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThe
      fundamental difference between Wikipedia citations and scientific\ncitations
      cannot be ignored, as the interpretation of these differs\ngreatly. Thus, the
      dynamic nature of Wikipedia must be clearly\nunderstood. Contrary to the static
      nature of citations to scientific\npapers, which theoretically speaking can
      never decrease, [the references\nin a Wikipedia article can indeed\ndisappear](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00171){target=\"_blank\"},
      and\neven reappear later. Analysing this phenomenon through a snapshot in\nwhich
      only the resources cited at a specific moment in time appear is\nuseful, but
      it may hinder the consideration of all these fluctuations\nand specificities
      of Wikipedia citations.\n\n### **2) Linguistic and cultural multiverses** {#linguistic-and-cultural-multiverses}\n\nWikipedia
      is a decentralised medium whose management falls in the hands\nof its [community
      of\neditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community){target=\"_blank\"},\nalso
      known as *wikipedians*, who dictate (many of) its\n[policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      must therefore have the [support of the\ncommunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThere
      is nothing immutable on Wikipedia. This is an important feature,\nresulting
      in [more than 300 language\neditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      are far from being mere translations. The community of\n*wikipedians* for each
      edition (also known as\n[*wikipedistas*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedistas){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      Spanish,\n[*wikip\u00e9diens*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Wikip%C3%A9diens){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      French or\n[*wikipedianen*](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedianen){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      Dutch) establishes their own policies and manages their contents. It\nis enough
      to take a quick look at the main page of the\n[Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[Dutch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/){target=\"_blank\"} Wikipedias to\nobserve
      clear differences. In fact, even the design or the name itself\ncan have a slight
      variation, see for example the case of the [Catalan\nViquip\u00e8dia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      or the\n[Galician](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia)\n[*Galipedia*](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThis
      obviously has an impact on the contents, which may introduce\n[cultural](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054){target=\"_blank\"}\n[biases](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054).\n\nAlthough
      the edits made to Wikipedia articles can come from users who\ncontribute independently,
      there are also communities organised around\ntopics. These are the so-called\n[WikiProjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject){target=\"_blank\"}.\nEach
      of them is focused on a specific topic, for example\n[astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Astronomy){target=\"_blank\"},\n[cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cats)
      or\n[Lady\nGaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lady_Gaga){target=\"_blank\"}.\nJust
      as each language edition has complete autonomy, so do the\nWikiProjects. Each
      one establishes its own specific guidelines for the\ndevelopment and improvement
      of the project\\''s articles of interest. They\ncan provide recommendations,
      such as following a specific structure, or\neven offer suggested literature,
      as in the case of the [lepidoptera\nWikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lepidoptera){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of these activities can thus affect the contents of an entire block\nof articles.
      In addition, especially in the case of the English\nWikipedia edition, WikiProjects
      organise the articles in a very\nremarkable way. [Wikipedia articles are\nclassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment){target=\"_blank\"}\naccording
      to two criteria: the *quality* of the article and its\n*importance* or priority
      for the WikiProject in question. The use of\nreferences plays a key role in
      establishing one categorisation or\nanother. It should be noted that this assignment
      is made freely by\n*wikipedians*, although the more advanced categories\n([Featured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria){target=\"_blank\"}\nand

      articles by quality level</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### * *3) Life beyond Wikipedia
      articles {#life-beyond-wikipedia-articles}\n\nIn Wikipedia, the contents of
      articles are the result of\n[consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThis
      is not always possible and results in a high number of edits in\nwhich several
      editors try to get ahead of each other in their respective\npoints of view.
      Wikipedia refers to these conflicts as [*edit\nwars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      some of [the most regrettable\nones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars){target=\"_blank\"}\nhave
      been documented. These conflicts are frequent in articles\nconcerning more sensitive
      and topical issues. When one of these wars\ntakes place, the community tries
      to reach a consensus on its own or with\nthe intervention of a\n[committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee){target=\"_blank\"}\nformed
      to help resolve it.\n\nFurthermore, *wikipedians* have the possibility to discuss
      the contents\nof articles openly with the rest of the community. Something that
      often\ngoes unnoticed on Wikipedia is the [talk\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages){target=\"_blank\"}\n(you
      can find the link to it next to the article title), where editors\ndo not only
      leave messages related to changes made or proposed changes,\nbut also allow
      these contents to be discussed for improvement. The\nscientific literature also
      has a place in these discussions, for example\nby [commenting on publications
      of interest for\ncitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Impact_factor/Archive_1#Published_article_to_consider_for_citation){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      the article or by [being used as support for the statements made in\nthe\ndiscussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Homeopathy/Archive_41#Reliable_source_for_%22fringe%22){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n|     |

      type appear in both lists.\n\n**  \n**\n\n### 4) How are the contents of Wikipedia
      classified by topics? {#how-are-the-contents-of-wikipedia-classified-by-topics}\n\nThe
      way in which content is classified by topics on Wikipedia has its\nups and downs.
      Wikipedia\\''s main system is the\n[categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories){target=\"_blank\"}\n([not
      to be confused with Wikidata\nConcepts](https://elib.dlr.de/188534/){target=\"_blank\"}),
      a\n[folksonomy](https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2017.sep.20){target=\"_blank\"}\nwhich,
      in the English edition Wikipedia alone, includes [2 million\ncategories](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6967464){target=\"_blank\"}.
      As\nan example of the usefulness and representativeness of these, the\nWikipedia
      article\n[Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\"_blank\"}\nhas
      only one category\n([Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bibliometrics){target=\"_blank\"}),\nwhile
      [Derek J. de Solla\nPrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price){target=\"_blank\"}\\''s\narticle
      has 16, with some such as ''[1922\nbirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1922_births){target=\"_blank\"}''\nand
      ''[1983\ndeaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1983_deaths){target=\"_blank\"}''.\nThis
      problem is undermined by the hierarchical relationships established\nbetween
      them. Because a category may have more than one parent category,\nit is difficult
      to establish a single broad topic for each Wikipedia\narticle.\n\nIn addition,
      Wikipedia has other systems that also organise its\n[contents by\ntopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      make browsing easier. Some of these are [overview\narticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews){target=\"_blank\"},\n[lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Lists){target=\"_blank\"}\nor\n[portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSystems
      such as WikiProjects can also be used for this purpose, as they\ndelimit articles
      related to a topic. There is also no shortage of\nmachine learning applications,
      such as\n[ORES](https://ores.wikimedia.org/){target=\"_blank\"}, an article
      topic\nmodel that predicts the topic of an article.*  \n*  \n\n<figure>\n<div

      **5) Wikipedia as the ultimate social media for measuring social attention**
      {#wikipedia-as-the-ultimate-social-media-for-measuring-social-attention}\n\nFinally,
      there is a wide range of metrics that can be obtained from\nWikipedia to understand
      the different interactions taking place at\nWikipedia. In this regard, it is
      worth recalling that Wikipedia is one\nof the websites with the [highest traffic\nworldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is in fact easy to find Wikipedia articles at the top of web search\nengine
      results, attracting millions of visits. Furthermore, not only is\nthere an English
      Wikipedia, which is the largest one and can be used as\na proxy for international
      forms of attention, but there are also\ndifferent language editions that can
      be used to capture local attention.\nAll things considered, what we have is
      a perfect social thermometer, the\nusefulness of which has already been noted,
      for example, for [monitoring\noutbreaks](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThe
      number of times an article has been edited, as well as the unique\nnumber of
      editors involved, can shed light on which articles are most\nactive and interesting
      for the Wikipedia community to engage with. In\nthe case of discussions, these
      can even be seen as a proxy for\nidentifying controversial content. On the other
      hand, the years since\nthe creation of the article and its length make it possible
      to\ncharacterise the article, while the number of references to scientific\narticles
      reflects the scientific orientation or interest of the article.\nThe possibilities
      are numerous, go far beyond these more general\napproaches, and many have yet
      to be explored.\n\nWhat is certain is that only by paying attention to these
      aspects when\nanalysing science in this social medium will it be possible to\nunderstand
      the role that science plays in Wikipedia, beyond its greater\nor lesser presence,
      as well as the implications and reach of these\nresources within the community
      of editors and society in general.\n", "images": [{"src": "https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure.png"},

      the general perception has progressively improved\\nover time.\\n\\nIn the case
      of scientometrics, its community has been studying the\\npresence of science
      on Wikipedia since before the formal [birth of\\n'altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/)'.
      In most cases, however,\\nthese previous studies have mostly focused on the
      analysis of the\\nscientific works mentioned on Wikipedia, rather than taking
      Wikipedia\\nitself as their main research object. This science-centric focus\\ntypically
      overlooks the potential of exploring the different\\nrelationships that Wikipedia
      has (or doesn't have) with science. In this\\npost I reflect about such potential
      by presenting five key facts about\\nthe nature of Wikipedia and its possibilities
      as a research source for\\nthe study of science-society interactions.\\n\\n###
      **1) Why are scientific publications cited on Wikipedia?** {#why-are-scientific-publications-cited-on-wikipedia}\\n\\nThe
      most common critique of Wikipedia has to do with the reliability of\\nits contents,
      a problem that Wikipedia itself [exhibits with complete\\ntransparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      its quest for reliability, Wikipedia places great importance on\\n[verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      is one of its [core content\\npolicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThere
      are several issues in these content policy guidelines that cannot\\nbe overlooked
      when studying Wikipedia citations to scientific\\npublications. Firstly, Wikipedia
      is an encyclopaedia. It may seem\\nobvious, but as stated in its content policy
      guidelines, \\\\\\\"*Wikipedia\\ndoes not publish* [*original\\nresearch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\\\\".\\nMoreover,
      Wikipedia only publishes information of [encyclopaedic\\nrelevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSecondly,
      not all sources are valid as citations on Wikipedia. At the\\ntop of the [list
      of source\\ntypologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nrecommended
      by Wikipedia are peer-reviewed scientific publications.\\n[Books are one of
      the most relevant\\nmaterials](https://doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-06-2018-0152){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      relevance of books for Wikipedia has even led publishers to offer\\nfree access
      to their collections to Wikipedia editors via proposals such\\nas [The Wikipedia\\nLibrary](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      fundamental difference between Wikipedia citations and scientific\\ncitations
      cannot be ignored, as the interpretation of these differs\\ngreatly. Thus, the
      dynamic nature of Wikipedia must be clearly\\nunderstood. Contrary to the static
      nature of citations to scientific\\npapers, which theoretically speaking can
      never decrease, [the references\\nin a Wikipedia article can indeed\\ndisappear](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00171){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and\\neven reappear later. Analysing this phenomenon through a snapshot in\\nwhich
      only the resources cited at a specific moment in time appear is\\nuseful, but
      it may hinder the consideration of all these fluctuations\\nand specificities
      of Wikipedia citations.\\n\\n### **2) Linguistic and cultural multiverses**
      {#linguistic-and-cultural-multiverses}\\n\\nWikipedia is a decentralised medium
      whose management falls in the hands\\nof its [community of\\neditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nalso
      known as *wikipedians*, who dictate (many of) its\\n[policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      must therefore have the [support of the\\ncommunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThere
      is nothing immutable on Wikipedia. This is an important feature,\\nresulting
      in [more than 300 language\\neditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      are far from being mere translations. The community of\\n*wikipedians* for each
      edition (also known as\\n[*wikipedistas*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedistas){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Spanish,\\n[*wikip\xE9diens*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Wikip%C3%A9diens){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      French or\\n[*wikipedianen*](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedianen){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Dutch) establishes their own policies and manages their contents. It\\nis enough
      to take a quick look at the main page of the\\n[Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[Dutch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} Wikipedias to\\nobserve
      clear differences. In fact, even the design or the name itself\\ncan have a
      slight variation, see for example the case of the [Catalan\\nViquip\xE8dia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or the\\n[Galician](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia)\\n[*Galipedia*](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      obviously has an impact on the contents, which may introduce\\n[cultural](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n[biases](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054).\\n\\nAlthough
      the edits made to Wikipedia articles can come from users who\\ncontribute independently,
      there are also communities organised around\\ntopics. These are the so-called\\n[WikiProjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEach
      of them is focused on a specific topic, for example\\n[astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Astronomy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cats)
      or\\n[Lady\\nGaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lady_Gaga){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nJust
      as each language edition has complete autonomy, so do the\\nWikiProjects. Each
      one establishes its own specific guidelines for the\\ndevelopment and improvement
      of the project\\\\'s articles of interest. They\\ncan provide recommendations,
      such as following a specific structure, or\\neven offer suggested literature,
      as in the case of the [lepidoptera\\nWikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lepidoptera){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSome
      of these activities can thus affect the contents of an entire block\\nof articles.
      In addition, especially in the case of the English\\nWikipedia edition, WikiProjects
      organise the articles in a very\\nremarkable way. [Wikipedia articles are\\nclassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\naccording
      to two criteria: the *quality* of the article and its\\n*importance* or priority
      for the WikiProject in question. The use of\\nreferences plays a key role in
      establishing one categorisation or\\nanother. It should be noted that this assignment

      Wikipedia articles {#life-beyond-wikipedia-articles}\\n\\nIn Wikipedia, the
      contents of articles are the result of\\n[consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      is not always possible and results in a high number of edits in\\nwhich several
      editors try to get ahead of each other in their respective\\npoints of view.
      Wikipedia refers to these conflicts as [*edit\\nwars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      some of [the most regrettable\\nones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      been documented. These conflicts are frequent in articles\\nconcerning more
      sensitive and topical issues. When one of these wars\\ntakes place, the community
      tries to reach a consensus on its own or with\\nthe intervention of a\\n[committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nformed
      to help resolve it.\\n\\nFurthermore, *wikipedians* have the possibility to
      discuss the contents\\nof articles openly with the rest of the community. Something
      that often\\ngoes unnoticed on Wikipedia is the [talk\\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(you
      can find the link to it next to the article title), where editors\\ndo not only
      leave messages related to changes made or proposed changes,\\nbut also allow
      these contents to be discussed for improvement. The\\nscientific literature
      also has a place in these discussions, for example\\nby [commenting on publications
      of interest for\\ncitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Impact_factor/Archive_1#Published_article_to_consider_for_citation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin

      Wikipedia classified by topics? {#how-are-the-contents-of-wikipedia-classified-by-topics}\\n\\nThe
      way in which content is classified by topics on Wikipedia has its\\nups and
      downs. Wikipedia\\\\'s main system is the\\n[categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n([not
      to be confused with Wikidata\\nConcepts](https://elib.dlr.de/188534/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      a\\n[folksonomy](https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2017.sep.20){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwhich,
      in the English edition Wikipedia alone, includes [2 million\\ncategories](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6967464){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      As\\nan example of the usefulness and representativeness of these, the\\nWikipedia
      article\\n[Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      only one category\\n([Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nwhile
      [Derek J. de Solla\\nPrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'s\\narticle
      has 16, with some such as '[1922\\nbirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1922_births){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\nand
      '[1983\\ndeaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1983_deaths){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'.\\nThis
      problem is undermined by the hierarchical relationships established\\nbetween
      them. Because a category may have more than one parent category,\\nit is difficult
      to establish a single broad topic for each Wikipedia\\narticle.\\n\\nIn addition,
      Wikipedia has other systems that also organise its\\n[contents by\\ntopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      make browsing easier. Some of these are [overview\\narticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Lists){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor\\n[portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSystems
      such as WikiProjects can also be used for this purpose, as they\\ndelimit articles
      related to a topic. There is also no shortage of\\nmachine learning applications,
      such as\\n[ORES](https://ores.wikimedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, an article
      topic\\nmodel that predicts the topic of an article.*  \\n*  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<div

      **5) Wikipedia as the ultimate social media for measuring social attention**
      {#wikipedia-as-the-ultimate-social-media-for-measuring-social-attention}\\n\\nFinally,
      there is a wide range of metrics that can be obtained from\\nWikipedia to understand
      the different interactions taking place at\\nWikipedia. In this regard, it is
      worth recalling that Wikipedia is one\\nof the websites with the [highest traffic\\nworldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is in fact easy to find Wikipedia articles at the top of web search\\nengine
      results, attracting millions of visits. Furthermore, not only is\\nthere an
      English Wikipedia, which is the largest one and can be used as\\na proxy for
      international forms of attention, but there are also\\ndifferent language editions
      that can be used to capture local attention.\\nAll things considered, what we
      have is a perfect social thermometer, the\\nusefulness of which has already
      been noted, for example, for [monitoring\\noutbreaks](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      number of times an article has been edited, as well as the unique\\nnumber of
      editors involved, can shed light on which articles are most\\nactive and interesting
      for the Wikipedia community to engage with. In\\nthe case of discussions, these
      can even be seen as a proxy for\\nidentifying controversial content. On the
      other hand, the years since\\nthe creation of the article and its length make
      it possible to\\ncharacterise the article, while the number of references to
      scientific\\narticles reflects the scientific orientation or interest of the
      article.\\nThe possibilities are numerous, go far beyond these more general\\napproaches,
      and many have yet to be explored.\\n\\nWhat is certain is that only by paying
      attention to these aspects when\\nanalysing science in this social medium will
      it be possible to\\nunderstand the role that science plays in Wikipedia, beyond
      its greater\\nor lesser presence, as well as the implications and reach of these\\nresources
      within the community of editors and society in general.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/five-key-facts-to-consider-when-studying-science-on-wikipedia\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      integrate it into the classroom. This conflict has yet to be\\nresolved, although
      the general perception has progressively improved\\nover time.\\n\\nIn the case
      of scientometrics, its community has been studying the\\npresence of science
      on Wikipedia since before the formal [birth of\\n'altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/)'.
      In most cases, however,\\nthese previous studies have mostly focused on the
      analysis of the\\nscientific works mentioned on Wikipedia, rather than taking
      Wikipedia\\nitself as their main research object. This science-centric focus\\ntypically
      overlooks the potential of exploring the different\\nrelationships that Wikipedia
      has (or doesn't have) with science. In this\\npost I reflect about such potential
      by presenting five key facts about\\nthe nature of Wikipedia and its possibilities
      as a research source for\\nthe study of science-society interactions.\\n\\n###
      **1) Why are scientific publications cited on Wikipedia?** {#why-are-scientific-publications-cited-on-wikipedia}\\n\\nThe
      most common critique of Wikipedia has to do with the reliability of\\nits contents,
      a problem that Wikipedia itself [exhibits with complete\\ntransparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      its quest for reliability, Wikipedia places great importance on\\n[verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      is one of its [core content\\npolicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThere
      are several issues in these content policy guidelines that cannot\\nbe overlooked
      when studying Wikipedia citations to scientific\\npublications. Firstly, Wikipedia
      is an encyclopaedia. It may seem\\nobvious, but as stated in its content policy
      guidelines, \\\\\\\"*Wikipedia\\ndoes not publish* [*original\\nresearch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\\\\".\\nMoreover,
      Wikipedia only publishes information of [encyclopaedic\\nrelevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSecondly,
      not all sources are valid as citations on Wikipedia. At the\\ntop of the [list
      of source\\ntypologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nrecommended
      by Wikipedia are peer-reviewed scientific publications.\\n[Books are one of
      the most relevant\\nmaterials](https://doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-06-2018-0152){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      relevance of books for Wikipedia has even led publishers to offer\\nfree access
      to their collections to Wikipedia editors via proposals such\\nas [The Wikipedia\\nLibrary](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      fundamental difference between Wikipedia citations and scientific\\ncitations
      cannot be ignored, as the interpretation of these differs\\ngreatly. Thus, the
      dynamic nature of Wikipedia must be clearly\\nunderstood. Contrary to the static
      nature of citations to scientific\\npapers, which theoretically speaking can
      never decrease, [the references\\nin a Wikipedia article can indeed\\ndisappear](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00171){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      and\\neven reappear later. Analysing this phenomenon through a snapshot in\\nwhich
      only the resources cited at a specific moment in time appear is\\nuseful, but
      it may hinder the consideration of all these fluctuations\\nand specificities
      of Wikipedia citations.\\n\\n### **2) Linguistic and cultural multiverses**
      {#linguistic-and-cultural-multiverses}\\n\\nWikipedia is a decentralised medium
      whose management falls in the hands\\nof its [community of\\neditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nalso
      known as *wikipedians*, who dictate (many of) its\\n[policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      must therefore have the [support of the\\ncommunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThere
      is nothing immutable on Wikipedia. This is an important feature,\\nresulting
      in [more than 300 language\\neditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      are far from being mere translations. The community of\\n*wikipedians* for each
      edition (also known as\\n[*wikipedistas*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedistas){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Spanish,\\n[*wikip\xE9diens*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Wikip%C3%A9diens){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      French or\\n[*wikipedianen*](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedianen){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      Dutch) establishes their own policies and manages their contents. It\\nis enough
      to take a quick look at the main page of the\\n[Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[Dutch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} Wikipedias to\\nobserve
      clear differences. In fact, even the design or the name itself\\ncan have a
      slight variation, see for example the case of the [Catalan\\nViquip\xE8dia](https://ca.wikipedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      or the\\n[Galician](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia)\\n[*Galipedia*](https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galipedia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      obviously has an impact on the contents, which may introduce\\n[cultural](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n[biases](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2018.00054).\\n\\nAlthough
      the edits made to Wikipedia articles can come from users who\\ncontribute independently,
      there are also communities organised around\\ntopics. These are the so-called\\n[WikiProjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEach
      of them is focused on a specific topic, for example\\n[astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Astronomy){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cats)
      or\\n[Lady\\nGaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lady_Gaga){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nJust
      as each language edition has complete autonomy, so do the\\nWikiProjects. Each
      one establishes its own specific guidelines for the\\ndevelopment and improvement
      of the project\\\\'s articles of interest. They\\ncan provide recommendations,
      such as following a specific structure, or\\neven offer suggested literature,
      as in the case of the [lepidoptera\\nWikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lepidoptera){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSome
      of these activities can thus affect the contents of an entire block\\nof articles.
      In addition, especially in the case of the English\\nWikipedia edition, WikiProjects
      organise the articles in a very\\nremarkable way. [Wikipedia articles are\\nclassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\naccording
      to two criteria: the *quality* of the article and its\\n*importance* or priority
      for the WikiProject in question. The use of\\nreferences plays a key role in
      establishing one categorisation or\\nanother. It should be noted that this assignment
      is made freely by\\n*wikipedians*, although the more advanced categories\\n([Featured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      [Good\\nArticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_criteria){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\ndepend
      on a more centralised and standardised system with a particular\\nsystem of
      nomination and voting.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Figure.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"30714\\\"
      />\\n<figcaption>Average length (in bytes) and referenced publications of\\nWikipedia
      articles by quality level</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n### * *3) Life beyond
      Wikipedia articles {#life-beyond-wikipedia-articles}\\n\\nIn Wikipedia, the
      contents of articles are the result of\\n[consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      is not always possible and results in a high number of edits in\\nwhich several
      editors try to get ahead of each other in their respective\\npoints of view.
      Wikipedia refers to these conflicts as [*edit\\nwars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      some of [the most regrettable\\nones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhave
      been documented. These conflicts are frequent in articles\\nconcerning more
      sensitive and topical issues. When one of these wars\\ntakes place, the community
      tries to reach a consensus on its own or with\\nthe intervention of a\\n[committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nformed
      to help resolve it.\\n\\nFurthermore, *wikipedians* have the possibility to
      discuss the contents\\nof articles openly with the rest of the community. Something
      that often\\ngoes unnoticed on Wikipedia is the [talk\\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(you
      can find the link to it next to the article title), where editors\\ndo not only
      leave messages related to changes made or proposed changes,\\nbut also allow
      these contents to be discussed for improvement. The\\nscientific literature
      also has a place in these discussions, for example\\nby [commenting on publications

      Wikipedia classified by topics? {#how-are-the-contents-of-wikipedia-classified-by-topics}\\n\\nThe
      way in which content is classified by topics on Wikipedia has its\\nups and
      downs. Wikipedia\\\\'s main system is the\\n[categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n([not
      to be confused with Wikidata\\nConcepts](https://elib.dlr.de/188534/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),
      a\\n[folksonomy](https://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2017.sep.20){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwhich,
      in the English edition Wikipedia alone, includes [2 million\\ncategories](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6967464){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      As\\nan example of the usefulness and representativeness of these, the\\nWikipedia
      article\\n[Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nhas
      only one category\\n([Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bibliometrics){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nwhile
      [Derek J. de Solla\\nPrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'s\\narticle
      has 16, with some such as '[1922\\nbirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1922_births){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\nand
      '[1983\\ndeaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1983_deaths){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'.\\nThis
      problem is undermined by the hierarchical relationships established\\nbetween
      them. Because a category may have more than one parent category,\\nit is difficult
      to establish a single broad topic for each Wikipedia\\narticle.\\n\\nIn addition,
      Wikipedia has other systems that also organise its\\n[contents by\\ntopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      make browsing easier. Some of these are [overview\\narticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Lists){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor\\n[portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nSystems
      such as WikiProjects can also be used for this purpose, as they\\ndelimit articles
      related to a topic. There is also no shortage of\\nmachine learning applications,
      such as\\n[ORES](https://ores.wikimedia.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, an article
      topic\\nmodel that predicts the topic of an article.*  \\n*  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<div

      **5) Wikipedia as the ultimate social media for measuring social attention**
      {#wikipedia-as-the-ultimate-social-media-for-measuring-social-attention}\\n\\nFinally,
      there is a wide range of metrics that can be obtained from\\nWikipedia to understand
      the different interactions taking place at\\nWikipedia. In this regard, it is
      worth recalling that Wikipedia is one\\nof the websites with the [highest traffic\\nworldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      is in fact easy to find Wikipedia articles at the top of web search\\nengine
      results, attracting millions of visits. Furthermore, not only is\\nthere an
      English Wikipedia, which is the largest one and can be used as\\na proxy for
      international forms of attention, but there are also\\ndifferent language editions
      that can be used to capture local attention.\\nAll things considered, what we
      have is a perfect social thermometer, the\\nusefulness of which has already
      been noted, for example, for [monitoring\\noutbreaks](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      number of times an article has been edited, as well as the unique\\nnumber of
      editors involved, can shed light on which articles are most\\nactive and interesting
      for the Wikipedia community to engage with. In\\nthe case of discussions, these
      can even be seen as a proxy for\\nidentifying controversial content. On the
      other hand, the years since\\nthe creation of the article and its length make
      it possible to\\ncharacterise the article, while the number of references to
      scientific\\narticles reflects the scientific orientation or interest of the
      article.\\nThe possibilities are numerous, go far beyond these more general\\napproaches,
      and many have yet to be explored.\\n\\nWhat is certain is that only by paying
      attention to these aspects when\\nanalysing science in this social medium will
      it be possible to\\nunderstand the role that science plays in Wikipedia, beyond
      its greater\\nor lesser presence, as well as the implications and reach of these\\nresources
      within the community of editors and society in general.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/five-key-facts-to-consider-when-studying-science-on-wikipedia\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      Elon Musk took over Twitter, there has been a steady stream\nof Twitter users
      looking for alternatives, such as\n[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      This alternative\nis part of a larger federation of social media services called
      the\n[fediverse](https://axbom.com/fediverse/){target=\"_blank\"}, which\nincludes
      not only a Twitter-like platform such as Mastodon, but also\nInstagram-like
      photo sharing and TikTok-like video sharing platforms for\nexample. The key
      idea is that this social media infrastructure is\ndecentralised, having no central
      authority that oversees or manages\neverything. Any user on any part of the
      federated social media can\nfollow any other user, across services, platforms
      and servers. Perhaps\nthe easiest to understand analogy is email: from a personal
      mail address\nlike\n[v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl](mailto:v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\"_blank\"}\nyou

      might wonder what the benefit of this decentralised alternative is\nover established
      social media such as Twitter, Instagram or TikTok. We\nbelieve that part of

      trust and moderation. Social media plays\nan increasing role in societal debates,

      media suffer from various problematic aspects. There are concerns\nof the [spread

      social media have increasingly tried to deal with this, it\nremains a rather
      daunting task.  \n\nAddressing problems of trust and moderation requires more
      than just\ndecentralised social media. At the moment, many Mastodon servers

      the strain of the millions of users migrating from Twitter to\nMastodon recently.
      Although such volunteer activity is supported by\ngenerous donations, this is
      unlikely to scale to the hundreds of\nmillions of Twitter users. Moderation
      is also run by volunteers, and\nscaling this to many millions of users is very
      challenging, running into\nexactly the same problems that Twitter and Facebook
      are facing. These\nestablished social media employ\n[hundreds](https://gizmodo.com/twitter-content-moderation-musk-midterms-1849726968){target=\"_blank\"}\nor
      even\n[thousands](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      moderators, while problematic messages keep flowing through the\ncracks. Moreover,
      moderation should not be in the hands of the few, and\nTwitter or Facebook should
      not unilaterally get to decide for the world\nwhat should be allowed and what
      should not.  \n\n### Host server\n\nWe propose that institutions should step
      up and take responsibility and\nhost their own servers. Institutions, like universities,
      research\ncentres, newspapers, publishers, broadcast companies, ministries and\nNGOs,
      all have a role to play in shaping the discussion on social media,\nwithout
      any single institution being in control. We believe that\ninstitutions setting
      up their own servers brings three benefits.\n\nFirst, by hosting their own servers,
      institutions contribute to trust\nand verification of users. Many institutions
      already have established\nand verified domain names, such as\n[cwts.nl](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}
      for our own\ninstitution, and this helps to establish a trusted presence on
      social\nmedia. Within the federated social media, accounts would be clearly\nassociated
      with that domain name, for example\n[@vtraag@social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl/@vtraag){target=\"_blank\"},\nclearly
      establishing that these users belong to that institution.\nInstitutions can
      limit users to staff members only and verify their\nidentity, thus establishing
      a trusted presence. Users may benefit from\nthe institutional connection, and
      as some have argued, this could\nestablish an organisation as [a trustworthy\nbrand](https://martinfowler.com/articles/your-org-run-mastodon.html){target=\"_blank\"},\nmaking
      Mastodon a more suitable platform for institutions than Twitter,\n[instead of\nless](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/11/10/academics-can-easily-leave-twitters-town-square-but-it-will-be-much-harder-for-their-institutions/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\nSecondly,
      institutions with their own servers would contribute to the\nmoderation of social
      media. Institutions need to take responsibility for\nmoderating the behaviour
      of users of their own server. This means that\ninstitutions should implement
      a clear moderation policy for their social\nmedia presence. This is how it should
      be: different contexts may require\ndifferent moderation policies. For example,
      researchers may have\ndifferent obligations and responsibilities than the general
      public. This\nway, institutions could help ensure that debates take place more\nrespectfully.
      At the same time, institutions would also help to ensure\nthat people are able
      to express themselves freely and safely.  \n\nThirdly, establishing institutional
      servers makes decentralised social\nmedia sustainable. As we already noted,
      it is unlikely that the current\nsystem will scale to millions of people based
      on voluntary\ncontributions. By stepping up and providing their own servers,\ninstitutions
      provide a critical part of the necessary infrastructure.\nNot only in monetary
      terms, but also in terms of time investment for\nverification and moderation.  \n\n###
      CWTS initiative\n\nThis is why at CWTS we have now launched our own social media
      server at\n[social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl){target=\"_blank\"}. Only
      people\nwho are affiliated with CWTS can register for an account on this server.\nIn
      practice, this means that CWTS staff members can register for an\naccount using
      their institutional email address. We have written a\nmoderation policy, and
      set up a moderation committee that will advise on\nany violations of this moderation
      policy to the management. The\nmanagement would not moderate messages directly,
      and only rely on the\nmoderation committee, thus providing some necessary checks
      and balances.\nWe trust CWTS staff members to behave responsibly in accordance
      with\nthis moderation policy. We will not actively check every message being\nposted,
      but reported messages will be followed up on.  \n\nDoes this initiative solve
      all problems of social media? Surely not.\nInstitutional users presumably represent
      only a small minority of social\nmedia users. How the large public will find
      its way on Mastodon is not\nyet clear. This initiative will not directly reduce
      societal\npolarisation, but it may help establish a trusted social media presence\nof
      researchers who can engage in societal debates. It also expands the\nbreadth
      of social media platforms that researchers can use to interact\nwith broader
      communities. We believe that setting up our own server is a\nstep forward, and
      we hope to see other institutions taking similar\ninitiatives.  \n", "images":

      not unilaterally get to decide for the world\nwhat should be allowed and what
      should not.  \n\n### Host server\n\nWe propose that institutions should step
      up and take responsibility and\nhost their own servers. Institutions, like universities,
      research\ncentres, newspapers, publishers, broadcast companies, ministries and\nNGOs,
      all have a role to play in shaping the discussion on social media,\nwithout
      any single institution being in control. We believe that\ninstitutions setting
      up their own servers brings three benefits.\n\nFirst, by hosting their own servers,
      institutions contribute to trust\nand verification of users. Many institutions
      already have established\nand verified domain names, such as\n[cwts.nl](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}
      for our own\ninstitution, and this helps to establish a trusted presence on
      social\nmedia. Within the federated social media, accounts would be clearly\nassociated
      with that domain name, for example\n[@vtraag@social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl/@vtraag){target=\"_blank\"},\nclearly
      establishing that these users belong to that institution.\nInstitutions can
      limit users to staff members only and verify their\nidentity, thus establishing
      a trusted presence. Users may benefit from\nthe institutional connection, and
      as some have argued, this could\nestablish an organisation as [a trustworthy\nbrand](https://martinfowler.com/articles/your-org-run-mastodon.html){target=\"_blank\"},\nmaking
      Mastodon a more suitable platform for institutions than Twitter,\n[instead of\nless](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/11/10/academics-can-easily-leave-twitters-town-square-but-it-will-be-much-harder-for-their-institutions/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\nSecondly,
      institutions with their own servers would contribute to the\nmoderation of social
      media. Institutions need to take responsibility for\nmoderating the behaviour
      of users of their own server. This means that\ninstitutions should implement
      a clear moderation policy for their social\nmedia presence. This is how it should
      be: different contexts may require\ndifferent moderation policies. For example,
      researchers may have\ndifferent obligations and responsibilities than the general
      public. This\nway, institutions could help ensure that debates take place more\nrespectfully.
      At the same time, institutions would also help to ensure\nthat people are able
      to express themselves freely and safely.  \n\nThirdly, establishing institutional
      servers makes decentralised social\nmedia sustainable. As we already noted,
      it is unlikely that the current\nsystem will scale to millions of people based
      on voluntary\ncontributions. By stepping up and providing their own servers,\ninstitutions
      provide a critical part of the necessary infrastructure.\nNot only in monetary
      terms, but also in terms of time investment for\nverification and moderation.  \n\n###
      CWTS initiative\n\nThis is why at CWTS we have now launched our own social media
      server at\n[social.cwts.nl](https://social.cwts.nl){target=\"_blank\"}. Only
      people\nwho are affiliated with CWTS can register for an account on this server.\nIn
      practice, this means that CWTS staff members can register for an\naccount using
      their institutional email address. We have written a\nmoderation policy, and
      set up a moderation committee that will advise on\nany violations of this moderation
      policy to the management. The\nmanagement would not moderate messages directly,
      and only rely on the\nmoderation committee, thus providing some necessary checks
      and balances.\nWe trust CWTS staff members to behave responsibly in accordance
      with\nthis moderation policy. We will not actively check every message being\nposted,
      but reported messages will be followed up on.  \n\nDoes this initiative solve
      all problems of social media? Surely not.\nInstitutional users presumably represent
      only a small minority of social\nmedia users. How the large public will find
      its way on Mastodon is not\nyet clear. This initiative will not directly reduce
      societal\npolarisation, but it may help establish a trusted social media presence\nof
      researchers who can engage in societal debates. It also expands the\nbreadth
      of social media platforms that researchers can use to interact\nwith broader
      communities. We believe that setting up our own server is a\nstep forward, and
      we hope to see other institutions taking similar\ninitiatives.  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/take-responsibility-for-social-media","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      the wider academic community with a call towards improving research\noutput
      tracking. Funding acknowledgments were a particular focal point.\nIn [the previous
      blog post in this\nseries](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      already addressed several issues at play in funding acknowledgment\ndata sets.
      In this second installment, we examine a specific real-life\nexample of one
      funding acknowledgment within which many of the issues\npresented in that previous
      post come together. [The article in\nquestion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.007){target=\"_blank\"}\nwas
      published in the *Journal of Molecular Biology*, with the research\nbeing primarily
      conducted at the College of Medicine, Florida State\nUniversity.\n\nIn this
      blog post, we suggest a taxonomy of different types of\nacknowledgment, all
      of which co-occur regularly in acknowledgment\nsections of published articles.
      In the reproduced acknowledgment section\nbelow, these different types are color-coded.
      We will show how different\nbibliographic databases parse and extract funding
      agencies and/or grant\nnumbers from this text, and how they can all end up with
      a different\nresult. By doing so, we would like to make clear that assigning
      funding\nagencies to publications is a process with a level of ambiguity, a\nprocess
      that relies at least partly on interpretation.\n\n> **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**\n>\n>

      X-ray structures have been\n> deposited in the PDB.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the above
      text, we identify three main types of acknowledgment:\n\n- [Personal acknowledgment:]{style=\"color:blue;\"}
      Individuals being\n  acknowledged for their roles in the research process\n-
      [Financial support:]{style=\"color:green;\"} Reference to grants,\n  contracts,
      or any phrasing that elucidates the financial component of\n  the acknowledgment
      (terms like \"funded\", \"financially supported\",\n  etc.)\n- [Logistics acknowledgment:]{style=\"color:red;\"}
      Reference to the use\n  of facilities, materials and/or machines used in the
      research process\n\nWhen bibliometric databases count funding acknowledgments,
      it is\nimportant to accurately make the above distinctions, since different\nanalyses
      require inclusion and exclusion of different acknowledgment\ntypes. This can
      already be difficult to ascertain when the wording in\nthe acknowledgment text
      is ambiguous (i.e., is \"Author A was supported\nby Harvard\" a financial acknowledgment?)
      or when the logistic support\ncomes with a grant or contract number.\n\nThat
      latter distinction, between grant and contract, is important to\nnote on its
      own terms:\n\n- **Grant**: in referencing [grant 0655133B from the American
      Heart\n  Association]{style=\"color:green;\"}, the authors are referencing a\n  specific
      grant number.\n- **Contract**: the authors also reference [Contract No.\n  W-31-109-Eng-38]{style=\"color:green;\"},
      a\n  [contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_DEAC0298CH10886_8900_-NONE-_-NONE-){target=\"_blank\"}\n  awarded
      by the US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office\n  of Science.\n\nThese
      types of financial support are distinct in their structure and\nfunction. While
      the case can be made for either type to be included as a\nfunding acknowledgment,
      adding them up without distinction can feel like\ncomparing apples and reds.
      Whether the financial support counted\npertains to researchers'' salaries, a
      tailored grant, or a large\ngovernment contract for a laboratory can be an important
      difference\ndepending on one''s analysis.\n\n### Different interpretations from
      bibliometric databases\n\nThe idea that acknowledgment texts are highly interpretable
      can be\nobserved in how different databases capture the acknowledgments of this\nexample
      paper. The tables below show the resulting funding organizations\nwhen using
      the Web of Science, Dimensions, Scopus and Crossref databases\nrespectively.\n\n:::

      Association |\n:::\n\n  \n  \n\nWhen comparing these results with the original
      acknowledgment text, the\ndifferent databases clearly exhibit varying degrees
      of accuracy.\n\nDimensions and Scopus provide the most comprehensive results,\nidentifying
      financial support from both the US Department of Energy and\nthe American Heart
      Association. In comparison, Web of Science only\nidentifies the US Department
      of Energy and Crossref only identifies the\nAmerican Heart Association.\n\nIn
      addition to this, the results from Dimensions also list the Argonne\nNational
      Laboratory which is not mentioned in the acknowledgment text.\nAfter further
      investigation it was found that the Advanced Photon Source\nis located at Argonne
      National Laboratory. This is a complicated case\nprecisely because it can be
      partly categorized as logistical support\n(\"Use of the Advanced Photon Source\")
      and partly financial (the\nmentioned contract). However, we would argue that
      having the Argonne\nNational Laboratory as the funder here is debatable since
      the funding\nthat is in play here is from the US Department of Energy *to* the\nArgonne
      National Laboratory. Arguably, the support from Argonne National\nLaboratory
      is logistical, while the support from the US Department of\nEnergy is financial
      yet of a more indirect type than the American Heart\nAssociation.\n\nFurthermore,
      there is also a variability in the identification of grant\nnumbers by the different
      databases. Web of Science and Scopus only find\na grant number for the US Department
      of Energy, whereas Dimensions and\nCrossref only find a grant number for the
      American Heart Association.\n\n### Extracting and identifying funding acknowledgements\n\nThe
      variation in the results can be partly explained by the different\napproaches
      taken by the databases for the extraction and identification\nof funding acknowledgment
      data.\n\n[Web of Science extracts and\ndisplays](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/webofscience/fundingsearch/){target=\"_blank\"}\nthe
      raw (source) text from the acknowledgment text, while Dimensions\nonly displays
      the resulting assignment to an organization in the [GRID\ndatabase](https://www.grid.ac/){target=\"_blank\"}
      it uses. To end up with\nthis assignment, [Dimensions uses a\ncombination](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018861-what-is-the-difference-between-funded-by-and-supporting-grants-shown-on-a-publication-page-){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      \"text-mining the ''Acknowledgments'' or ''Funding'' section\" and\n\"structured
      metadata received from some of our publication data sources,\ne.g., Crossref
      or PubMed\".\n\nThe [funder registry used by\nCrossref](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/){target=\"_blank\"}\nwas
      donated by Elsevier, and is combined with acknowledgment and grant\ninformation
      provided to Crossref by publishers and funding agencies in\norder to connect
      the funders in the registry to publications. Scopus\nextracts organizations
      from the acknowledgment text and [matches them to\nthe Crossref funding\nregistry](https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/funder-registry){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThese
      methodological differences can result in the potential loss of\ndiscerning information
      regarding the identification of funding\norganizations. For example, in the
      acknowledgment text the reference to\nthe US Department of Energy consists of
      three parts: the funding agency\n(US Department of Energy), the funding programme
      (Basic Energy Sciences)\nand the programme office (Office of Science).\n\nWeb
      of Science identifies this information as one funder, including the\nhierarchical
      structure of the organization within the name. In\ncomparison, Scopus lists
      these different levels as separate\norganizations, resulting in the identification
      of three funders where\nthere should only be one.\n\nIt is also important to
      note that the relationships between the\norganizations are not documented within
      the funding registry created by\nWeb of Science. The hierarchical relationships
      between different\norganizations are available within the Crossref and GRID
      registries used\nby the other databases, allowing organizations to be aggregated
      into\nhigher-level entities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese types of discrepancies
      in funding acknowledgments are not rare.\nThe standards and practices of what
      or whom to acknowledge [vary\ndepending on the field of\nstudy,](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185578){target=\"_blank\"}\nwith
      [cultural\nfactors](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22692){target=\"_blank\"} also\nplaying
      a role.\n\nThe above example illustrates certain nuances that one needs to be
      aware\nof when analyzing funding acknowledgment databases; each database\ncaptures
      and interprets the data differently and the exact nature of the\nacknowledgment
      is not always obvious. Moreover, it also shows that\ncounting acknowledgments
      is not a straightforward task, with one paper\nresulting in either 1, 2, 3 or
      4 acknowledgments depending on which\nbibliographic database you refer to.\n\nIt
      would be helpful if bibliographic data providers were more\nforthcoming on the
      decision processes that lie behind such results as\nshown above. How do they
      distinguish funding acknowledgments from other\ntypes of acknowledgments? Why
      do they include certain mentioned\norganizations in the text and ignore others?
      For some data providers, it\nis also not clear whether the connected funder
      is extracted from the\ntext or derived from other sources, such as data provided
      by the\npublisher or funder. Here, too, transparency would be helpful for those\nusing
      the data.\n\nFinally, though one standardized format of writing acknowledgments
      could\nnever fit every case, as mentioned in the [previous\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements){target=\"_blank\"},\nusing
      [persistent\nidentifiers](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/nwo-persistent-identifier-strategy-will-lead-increased-efficiency-and-insight){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      templates provided by funders can help to streamline the processing\nof this
      data.\n\n*Part 2 of the series on Funding Acknowledgements in Academic\nPublishing*\n\n*Photo

      Association |\\n:::\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nWhen comparing these results with the
      original acknowledgment text, the\\ndifferent databases clearly exhibit varying
      degrees of accuracy.\\n\\nDimensions and Scopus provide the most comprehensive
      results,\\nidentifying financial support from both the US Department of Energy
      and\\nthe American Heart Association. In comparison, Web of Science only\\nidentifies
      the US Department of Energy and Crossref only identifies the\\nAmerican Heart
      Association.\\n\\nIn addition to this, the results from Dimensions also list
      the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory which is not mentioned in the acknowledgment
      text.\\nAfter further investigation it was found that the Advanced Photon Source\\nis
      located at Argonne National Laboratory. This is a complicated case\\nprecisely
      because it can be partly categorized as logistical support\\n(\\\"Use of the
      Advanced Photon Source\\\") and partly financial (the\\nmentioned contract).
      However, we would argue that having the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory as the
      funder here is debatable since the funding\\nthat is in play here is from the
      US Department of Energy *to* the\\nArgonne National Laboratory. Arguably, the
      support from Argonne National\\nLaboratory is logistical, while the support
      from the US Department of\\nEnergy is financial yet of a more indirect type
      than the American Heart\\nAssociation.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is also a variability
      in the identification of grant\\nnumbers by the different databases. Web of
      Science and Scopus only find\\na grant number for the US Department of Energy,
      whereas Dimensions and\\nCrossref only find a grant number for the American
      Heart Association.\\n\\n### Extracting and identifying funding acknowledgements\\n\\nThe
      variation in the results can be partly explained by the different\\napproaches
      taken by the databases for the extraction and identification\\nof funding acknowledgment
      data.\\n\\n[Web of Science extracts and\\ndisplays](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/webofscience/fundingsearch/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthe
      raw (source) text from the acknowledgment text, while Dimensions\\nonly displays
      the resulting assignment to an organization in the [GRID\\ndatabase](https://www.grid.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      it uses. To end up with\\nthis assignment, [Dimensions uses a\\ncombination](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018861-what-is-the-difference-between-funded-by-and-supporting-grants-shown-on-a-publication-page-){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      \\\"text-mining the 'Acknowledgments' or 'Funding' section\\\" and\\n\\\"structured
      metadata received from some of our publication data sources,\\ne.g., Crossref
      or PubMed\\\".\\n\\nThe [funder registry used by\\nCrossref](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwas
      donated by Elsevier, and is combined with acknowledgment and grant\\ninformation
      provided to Crossref by publishers and funding agencies in\\norder to connect
      the funders in the registry to publications. Scopus\\nextracts organizations
      from the acknowledgment text and [matches them to\\nthe Crossref funding\\nregistry](https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/funder-registry){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThese
      methodological differences can result in the potential loss of\\ndiscerning
      information regarding the identification of funding\\norganizations. For example,
      in the acknowledgment text the reference to\\nthe US Department of Energy consists
      of three parts: the funding agency\\n(US Department of Energy), the funding
      programme (Basic Energy Sciences)\\nand the programme office (Office of Science).\\n\\nWeb
      of Science identifies this information as one funder, including the\\nhierarchical
      structure of the organization within the name. In\\ncomparison, Scopus lists
      these different levels as separate\\norganizations, resulting in the identification
      of three funders where\\nthere should only be one.\\n\\nIt is also important
      to note that the relationships between the\\norganizations are not documented
      within the funding registry created by\\nWeb of Science. The hierarchical relationships
      between different\\norganizations are available within the Crossref and GRID
      registries used\\nby the other databases, allowing organizations to be aggregated
      into\\nhigher-level entities.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThese types of discrepancies
      in funding acknowledgments are not rare.\\nThe standards and practices of what
      or whom to acknowledge [vary\\ndepending on the field of\\nstudy,](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185578){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwith
      [cultural\\nfactors](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22692){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      also\\nplaying a role.\\n\\nThe above example illustrates certain nuances that
      one needs to be aware\\nof when analyzing funding acknowledgment databases;
      each database\\ncaptures and interprets the data differently and the exact nature
      of the\\nacknowledgment is not always obvious. Moreover, it also shows that\\ncounting
      acknowledgments is not a straightforward task, with one paper\\nresulting in
      either 1, 2, 3 or 4 acknowledgments depending on which\\nbibliographic database
      you refer to.\\n\\nIt would be helpful if bibliographic data providers were
      more\\nforthcoming on the decision processes that lie behind such results as\\nshown
      above. How do they distinguish funding acknowledgments from other\\ntypes of
      acknowledgments? Why do they include certain mentioned\\norganizations in the
      text and ignore others? For some data providers, it\\nis also not clear whether
      the connected funder is extracted from the\\ntext or derived from other sources,
      such as data provided by the\\npublisher or funder. Here, too, transparency
      would be helpful for those\\nusing the data.\\n\\nFinally, though one standardized
      format of writing acknowledgments could\\nnever fit every case, as mentioned
      in the [previous\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nusing
      [persistent\\nidentifiers](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/nwo-persistent-identifier-strategy-will-lead-increased-efficiency-and-insight){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      templates provided by funders can help to streamline the processing\\nof this
      data.\\n\\n*Part 2 of the series on Funding Acknowledgements in Academic\\nPublishing*\\n\\n*Photo

      the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory which is not mentioned in the acknowledgment
      text.\\nAfter further investigation it was found that the Advanced Photon Source\\nis
      located at Argonne National Laboratory. This is a complicated case\\nprecisely
      because it can be partly categorized as logistical support\\n(\\\"Use of the
      Advanced Photon Source\\\") and partly financial (the\\nmentioned contract).
      However, we would argue that having the Argonne\\nNational Laboratory as the
      funder here is debatable since the funding\\nthat is in play here is from the
      US Department of Energy *to* the\\nArgonne National Laboratory. Arguably, the
      support from Argonne National\\nLaboratory is logistical, while the support
      from the US Department of\\nEnergy is financial yet of a more indirect type
      than the American Heart\\nAssociation.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is also a variability
      in the identification of grant\\nnumbers by the different databases. Web of
      Science and Scopus only find\\na grant number for the US Department of Energy,
      whereas Dimensions and\\nCrossref only find a grant number for the American
      Heart Association.\\n\\n### Extracting and identifying funding acknowledgements\\n\\nThe
      variation in the results can be partly explained by the different\\napproaches
      taken by the databases for the extraction and identification\\nof funding acknowledgment
      data.\\n\\n[Web of Science extracts and\\ndisplays](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/webofscience/fundingsearch/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthe
      raw (source) text from the acknowledgment text, while Dimensions\\nonly displays
      the resulting assignment to an organization in the [GRID\\ndatabase](https://www.grid.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      it uses. To end up with\\nthis assignment, [Dimensions uses a\\ncombination](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018861-what-is-the-difference-between-funded-by-and-supporting-grants-shown-on-a-publication-page-){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      \\\"text-mining the 'Acknowledgments' or 'Funding' section\\\" and\\n\\\"structured
      metadata received from some of our publication data sources,\\ne.g., Crossref
      or PubMed\\\".\\n\\nThe [funder registry used by\\nCrossref](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwas
      donated by Elsevier, and is combined with acknowledgment and grant\\ninformation
      provided to Crossref by publishers and funding agencies in\\norder to connect
      the funders in the registry to publications. Scopus\\nextracts organizations
      from the acknowledgment text and [matches them to\\nthe Crossref funding\\nregistry](https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/research-initiatives/funder-registry){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThese
      methodological differences can result in the potential loss of\\ndiscerning
      information regarding the identification of funding\\norganizations. For example,
      in the acknowledgment text the reference to\\nthe US Department of Energy consists
      of three parts: the funding agency\\n(US Department of Energy), the funding
      programme (Basic Energy Sciences)\\nand the programme office (Office of Science).\\n\\nWeb
      of Science identifies this information as one funder, including the\\nhierarchical
      structure of the organization within the name. In\\ncomparison, Scopus lists
      these different levels as separate\\norganizations, resulting in the identification
      of three funders where\\nthere should only be one.\\n\\nIt is also important
      to note that the relationships between the\\norganizations are not documented
      within the funding registry created by\\nWeb of Science. The hierarchical relationships
      between different\\norganizations are available within the Crossref and GRID
      registries used\\nby the other databases, allowing organizations to be aggregated
      into\\nhigher-level entities.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThese types of discrepancies
      in funding acknowledgments are not rare.\\nThe standards and practices of what
      or whom to acknowledge [vary\\ndepending on the field of\\nstudy,](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185578){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwith
      [cultural\\nfactors](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22692){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      also\\nplaying a role.\\n\\nThe above example illustrates certain nuances that
      one needs to be aware\\nof when analyzing funding acknowledgment databases;
      each database\\ncaptures and interprets the data differently and the exact nature
      of the\\nacknowledgment is not always obvious. Moreover, it also shows that\\ncounting
      acknowledgments is not a straightforward task, with one paper\\nresulting in
      either 1, 2, 3 or 4 acknowledgments depending on which\\nbibliographic database
      you refer to.\\n\\nIt would be helpful if bibliographic data providers were
      more\\nforthcoming on the decision processes that lie behind such results as\\nshown
      above. How do they distinguish funding acknowledgments from other\\ntypes of
      acknowledgments? Why do they include certain mentioned\\norganizations in the
      text and ignore others? For some data providers, it\\nis also not clear whether
      the connected funder is extracted from the\\ntext or derived from other sources,
      such as data provided by the\\npublisher or funder. Here, too, transparency
      would be helpful for those\\nusing the data.\\n\\nFinally, though one standardized
      format of writing acknowledgments could\\nnever fit every case, as mentioned
      in the [previous\\npost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/to-count-or-not-to-count-how-to-deal-with-funding-acknowledgements){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nusing
      [persistent\\nidentifiers](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/nwo-persistent-identifier-strategy-will-lead-increased-efficiency-and-insight){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      templates provided by funders can help to streamline the processing\\nof this
      data.\\n\\n*Part 2 of the series on Funding Acknowledgements in Academic\\nPublishing*\\n\\n*Photo

      Nothing new so far. Yet formalised\ninternational strategic partnerships between
      universities are more\nrecent. These agreements include both research and education
      and cover a\nrange of departments. And they are expected to contribute to strategic\ngoals
      and have great impact.\n\nThe University of Edinburgh is involved in a range
      of strategic\npartnerships, and noticed a lack of consistent, aligned evaluation\npractices.
      It proved a challenge to assess whether to enter into an\nagreement with a potential
      partner, or whether a strategic partnership\nindeed delivered its expectations,
      let alone to discuss this with their\nstrategic partners. They invited five
      of their strategic partners\n(Universities of Copenhagen, Helsinki, Leiden,
      Sydney, and University\nCollege Dublin) to join hands, develop an evaluation
      framework and\npublish a handbook. The framework had to be based on state-of-the-art\nliterature
      and had to lead to clear assessments of strategic\npartnerships.\n\n<figure

      />\n</figure>\n\nEnter Leiden University''s CWTS and the University of Edinburgh\\''s\nScience,
      Technology and Innovation Studies (STIS). We were asked to\ncontribute to the
      project, given our expertise in research assessment,\nresearch governance and
      STIS''s knowledge of collaboration and\ninternationalization.\n\nThe literature
      review by STIS is extensive and rich and covers\ninternationalization, mobility,
      and environmental impacts of\ninternational collaboration. Yet it was not straightforward
      to find\nliterature immediately relevant for international strategic partnerships\nbetween
      universities, nor on the evaluation of such agreements.\nTherefore, we first
      unpacked the notion of international strategic\npartnerships, to understand
      the different forms and formats it can take.\nThis approach delivered keywords
      for a broader literature review, which\nput forward various, separate bodies
      of literature that are all relevant\nto international partnerships. The literature
      review provided our\nevidence base to develop the framework. And more on (the
      literature\nreview on) internationalisation in an upcoming blogpost by Rodrigo\nLiscovsky.\n\nAs
      strategic international partnerships come in different shapes and\nforms, we
      had doubts from the start about the feasibility to develop a\nsimple framework,
      with straightforward guidelines on data and a clear\nassessment as result. To
      ensure the framework could be used in a variety\nof situations, we wanted to
      take the context into account. Context is\nrelevant both in terms of governance
      (e.g. how the evaluation is used),\nas well as in terms of the partnership,
      including the history of the\npartnership, its goals and implementation plan.\n\nSome
      examples to illustrate the diversity the framework needed to cover.\nAccording
      to the definition developed by our partners, strategic\npartnerships include
      both research and education. However, it soon\nbecame clear that some of their
      strategic partnerships are research\nonly. In addition, according to their definition,
      strategic partnerships\nare between universities, while we also heard about
      partnerships with a\nvariety of partners, including local authorities. Also,
      a strategic\npartnership should be university wide. Yet several of the partnerships\nare
      focused on one or two topics only. And regarding use and governance:\nwe noticed
      that some universities wanted to use evaluation to gain\ninsight into the partnership
      and develop recommendations for\nimprovement, whereas in other universities
      the evaluation was going to\nbe used to inform decisions.\n\nWe heard a lot
      about the strategic importance of partnerships, little\nabout its implementation
      and management, and even less about their\nevaluation. We realized that whatever
      framework we would develop, it\nwould differ substantively from the expectations
      of a comprehensive\nevaluation tool. Instead, we felt we needed to address simple\nimplementation
      and evaluation questions, and we wanted to ensure the\nframework could be used
      in different governance systems, and at any time\nin a partnership (before,
      during, towards the end). We therefore started\nto think of a framework consisting
      of a set of questions and were\ninspired by examples such as the [Societal Readiness
      Thinking\nTool](https://thinkingtool.eu/#:~:text=The%20thinking%20tool%20offers%20practical,with%20societal%20needs%20and%20expectations.){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [Toolbox Policy\nEvaluation](https://www.toolboxbeleidsevaluaties.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\n(in
      Dutch).\n\nWe realized that in order to develop a useful evaluation framework,
      we\nhad to collaborate closely with the international officers from the six\npartner
      universities and take them along in the development. We proposed\nto develop
      the framework on the go. One of us had done so before, when\ndeveloping a societal
      impact approach with and for research\ninfrastructures in the\n[ACCELERATE](https://www.accelerate2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/D-1.5-Final-Assessment-Protocol.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nproject.
      We asked each of the six partners to do a case study, i.e., to\nevaluate an
      existing strategic partnership and we offered to guide them\nthrough this approach.
      We also suggested to use a \"logbook\" and keep\nnotes of any changes in the
      evaluation, new insights, eye-openers,\nquestions, etc.\n\nAs a result, our
      partners contributed evaluations of, in random order,\ntheir very first partnership;
      a research collaboration focused on two\ntopics and two universities; a research
      collaboration of one university\nwith a variety of partners in a specific region;
      the portfolio of\npartners in one continent and university wide collaborations
      covering\nresearch, education as well as professional staff.\n\nWe organized
      four online meetings with each partner and planned to\naddress different topics
      in every meeting. The topic of the first\nmeeting was the history, rationale
      and context of the partnership and\nthe reason to evaluate. The result would
      be a clear evaluation question.\nThe second meeting was dedicated to data collection,
      the third to\nanalysis of the data and the fourth and final to the interpretation
      of\nthe evidence collected, and the formulation of the assessment of the\npartnership.\n\nIn
      practice the flow was iterative, and new topics arose every time.\nComposing
      the evaluation question was not easy at all and required many\nreformulations.
      The history and rationale of a partnership were\naddressed in subsequent meetings.
      The implementation of the partnership\nand the roles and responsibilities were
      brought up more than once. And\nwhen several partners wanted to reach out to
      researchers and students,\nwe spent ample time talking about qualitative research
      methods such as\ninterviews and surveys.\n\n<figure style=\"float:left; margin-right:15px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture2_2022-11-23-154707_revp.png\"\ndata-image=\"30189\"
      />\n</figure>\n\nAccording to their own account, our partners lost confidence
      when they\nfirst started working on their case. They grappled with the complexity\nof
      contextual factors and the variety of perspectives of students,\nresearchers,
      administrators, and the partner university. However, after\nfour online meetings,
      they regained confidence when we met in person for\nthe very first time. They
      presented and discussed their evaluations,\nthought along with each other, and
      advised on next steps. Several\nmentioned that it was all about asking the right
      questions and they\nasked each other the right questions indeed.\n\nIn the end,
      the framework we developed together is basically a series of\nquestions. About
      the context of the evaluation (Why evaluate? What is\nthe goal?); about the
      specific evaluation (What is the evaluation about?\nWhat is the central question?);
      and about the context of the partnership\n(What is the history? What are the
      targets?). Plus, it includes an\nextensive methodological section. When we presented
      the framework, our\npartners recognised the questions and accepted it as a useful
      framework.\n\n<figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:15px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture3_2022-11-23-155045_hwwc.png\"\ndata-image=\"30191\"
      />\n</figure>\n\nThe final phase of the project was the development of the handbook.
      We\ndescribed the framework, completed the literature review and our\npartners
      described their evaluation. Perhaps the most interesting\nchapter is Lessons
      Learnt from the EVALUATE project, written by our\npartners. Remember how they
      struggled with the diverse perspectives?\nThey now acknowledge the variety of
      perspectives, suggest taking these\ninto account and use participative methods.
      They provide recommendations\non such diverse topics as data collection, the
      use of evaluation and the\nimplementation of strategic partnerships. They question
      unrealistic\nexpectations and bold claims, such as turning students into \"global\ncitizens\"
      or using research to address \"global challenges\". And they\nadvise thinking
      about evaluation as an opportunity to build capacity and\ninvolve and inspire
      partners.\n\nWe had hoped that talking about evaluation of strategic partnerships\nwould
      lead to changes in the management and implementation. And indeed,\nwhen we met
      for the second time, we noticed how our partners were\nchanging their practice.
      Several had discussed expectations and\nintentions with their partner universities,
      as well as within their own\nuniversity. Something they hardly did before. Moreover,
      they wanted to\nreach out to partner universities outside of Europe and Australia
      and\nuse the experience, and the framework, for these partnerships as well.\n\nBut
      we need to be realistic. In general, many see strategic partnerships\nas, well,
      of strategic importance. They expect great contributions,\nhowever small the
      partnership. And when it comes to the newest\ndevelopment of university alliances,
      expectations are even grander. Four\nuniversities involved in EVALUATE, including
      the universities where we\nare based, are part of [Una\nEuropa](https://www.una-europa.eu/about/manifesto){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\nalliance believes a university is created by and for society and as such\ndriven
      to be of relevance, impact and high quality. It is a laboratory\nof the here
      and now, where creativity and experimentation unlock the\nhidden potentials
      of tomorrow. Who is against this creed? Not many, we\nguess. But what does it
      mean in practice? What is the evidence? How can\nthis be assessed? Let''s talk
      about our partnership!\n\nEVALUATE is funded under ERASMUS+ Key Action 2.\n\nThis
      blogpost is based on the experience of the authors with the\nEVALUATE project

      involved in a range of strategic\npartnerships, and noticed a lack of consistent,
      aligned evaluation\npractices. It proved a challenge to assess whether to enter
      into an\nagreement with a potential partner, or whether a strategic partnership\nindeed
      delivered its expectations, let alone to discuss this with their\nstrategic
      partners. They invited five of their strategic partners\n(Universities of Copenhagen,
      Helsinki, Leiden, Sydney, and University\nCollege Dublin) to join hands, develop
      an evaluation framework and\npublish a handbook. The framework had to be based
      on state-of-the-art\nliterature and had to lead to clear assessments of strategic\npartnerships.\n\n<figure

      Technology and Innovation Studies (STIS). We were asked to\ncontribute to the
      project, given our expertise in research assessment,\nresearch governance and
      STIS''s knowledge of collaboration and\ninternationalization.\n\nThe literature
      review by STIS is extensive and rich and covers\ninternationalization, mobility,
      and environmental impacts of\ninternational collaboration. Yet it was not straightforward
      to find\nliterature immediately relevant for international strategic partnerships\nbetween
      universities, nor on the evaluation of such agreements.\nTherefore, we first
      unpacked the notion of international strategic\npartnerships, to understand
      the different forms and formats it can take.\nThis approach delivered keywords
      for a broader literature review, which\nput forward various, separate bodies
      of literature that are all relevant\nto international partnerships. The literature
      review provided our\nevidence base to develop the framework. And more on (the
      literature\nreview on) internationalisation in an upcoming blogpost by Rodrigo\nLiscovsky.\n\nAs
      strategic international partnerships come in different shapes and\nforms, we
      had doubts from the start about the feasibility to develop a\nsimple framework,
      with straightforward guidelines on data and a clear\nassessment as result. To
      ensure the framework could be used in a variety\nof situations, we wanted to
      take the context into account. Context is\nrelevant both in terms of governance
      (e.g. how the evaluation is used),\nas well as in terms of the partnership,
      including the history of the\npartnership, its goals and implementation plan.\n\nSome
      examples to illustrate the diversity the framework needed to cover.\nAccording
      to the definition developed by our partners, strategic\npartnerships include
      both research and education. However, it soon\nbecame clear that some of their
      strategic partnerships are research\nonly. In addition, according to their definition,
      strategic partnerships\nare between universities, while we also heard about
      partnerships with a\nvariety of partners, including local authorities. Also,
      a strategic\npartnership should be university wide. Yet several of the partnerships\nare
      focused on one or two topics only. And regarding use and governance:\nwe noticed
      that some universities wanted to use evaluation to gain\ninsight into the partnership
      and develop recommendations for\nimprovement, whereas in other universities
      the evaluation was going to\nbe used to inform decisions.\n\nWe heard a lot
      about the strategic importance of partnerships, little\nabout its implementation
      and management, and even less about their\nevaluation. We realized that whatever
      framework we would develop, it\nwould differ substantively from the expectations
      of a comprehensive\nevaluation tool. Instead, we felt we needed to address simple\nimplementation
      and evaluation questions, and we wanted to ensure the\nframework could be used
      in different governance systems, and at any time\nin a partnership (before,
      during, towards the end). We therefore started\nto think of a framework consisting
      of a set of questions and were\ninspired by examples such as the [Societal Readiness
      Thinking\nTool](https://thinkingtool.eu/#:~:text=The%20thinking%20tool%20offers%20practical,with%20societal%20needs%20and%20expectations.){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [Toolbox Policy\nEvaluation](https://www.toolboxbeleidsevaluaties.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\n(in
      Dutch).\n\nWe realized that in order to develop a useful evaluation framework,
      we\nhad to collaborate closely with the international officers from the six\npartner
      universities and take them along in the development. We proposed\nto develop
      the framework on the go. One of us had done so before, when\ndeveloping a societal
      impact approach with and for research\ninfrastructures in the\n[ACCELERATE](https://www.accelerate2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/D-1.5-Final-Assessment-Protocol.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nproject.
      We asked each of the six partners to do a case study, i.e., to\nevaluate an
      existing strategic partnership and we offered to guide them\nthrough this approach.
      We also suggested to use a \"logbook\" and keep\nnotes of any changes in the
      evaluation, new insights, eye-openers,\nquestions, etc.\n\nAs a result, our
      partners contributed evaluations of, in random order,\ntheir very first partnership;
      a research collaboration focused on two\ntopics and two universities; a research
      collaboration of one university\nwith a variety of partners in a specific region;
      the portfolio of\npartners in one continent and university wide collaborations
      covering\nresearch, education as well as professional staff.\n\nWe organized
      four online meetings with each partner and planned to\naddress different topics
      in every meeting. The topic of the first\nmeeting was the history, rationale
      and context of the partnership and\nthe reason to evaluate. The result would
      be a clear evaluation question.\nThe second meeting was dedicated to data collection,
      the third to\nanalysis of the data and the fourth and final to the interpretation
      of\nthe evidence collected, and the formulation of the assessment of the\npartnership.\n\nIn
      practice the flow was iterative, and new topics arose every time.\nComposing
      the evaluation question was not easy at all and required many\nreformulations.
      The history and rationale of a partnership were\naddressed in subsequent meetings.
      The implementation of the partnership\nand the roles and responsibilities were
      brought up more than once. And\nwhen several partners wanted to reach out to
      researchers and students,\nwe spent ample time talking about qualitative research
      methods such as\ninterviews and surveys.\n\n<figure style=\"float:left; margin-right:15px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture2_2022-11-23-154707_revp.png\"\ndata-image=\"30189\"
      />\n</figure>\n\nAccording to their own account, our partners lost confidence
      when they\nfirst started working on their case. They grappled with the complexity\nof
      contextual factors and the variety of perspectives of students,\nresearchers,
      administrators, and the partner university. However, after\nfour online meetings,
      they regained confidence when we met in person for\nthe very first time. They
      presented and discussed their evaluations,\nthought along with each other, and
      advised on next steps. Several\nmentioned that it was all about asking the right
      questions and they\nasked each other the right questions indeed.\n\nIn the end,
      the framework we developed together is basically a series of\nquestions. About
      the context of the evaluation (Why evaluate? What is\nthe goal?); about the
      specific evaluation (What is the evaluation about?\nWhat is the central question?);
      and about the context of the partnership\n(What is the history? What are the
      targets?). Plus, it includes an\nextensive methodological section. When we presented
      the framework, our\npartners recognised the questions and accepted it as a useful
      framework.\n\n<figure style=\"float:right; margin-left:15px;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20221122_Picture3_2022-11-23-155045_hwwc.png\"\ndata-image=\"30191\"
      />\n</figure>\n\nThe final phase of the project was the development of the handbook.
      We\ndescribed the framework, completed the literature review and our\npartners
      described their evaluation. Perhaps the most interesting\nchapter is Lessons
      Learnt from the EVALUATE project, written by our\npartners. Remember how they
      struggled with the diverse perspectives?\nThey now acknowledge the variety of
      perspectives, suggest taking these\ninto account and use participative methods.
      They provide recommendations\non such diverse topics as data collection, the
      use of evaluation and the\nimplementation of strategic partnerships. They question
      unrealistic\nexpectations and bold claims, such as turning students into \"global\ncitizens\"
      or using research to address \"global challenges\". And they\nadvise thinking
      about evaluation as an opportunity to build capacity and\ninvolve and inspire
      partners.\n\nWe had hoped that talking about evaluation of strategic partnerships\nwould
      lead to changes in the management and implementation. And indeed,\nwhen we met
      for the second time, we noticed how our partners were\nchanging their practice.
      Several had discussed expectations and\nintentions with their partner universities,
      as well as within their own\nuniversity. Something they hardly did before. Moreover,
      they wanted to\nreach out to partner universities outside of Europe and Australia
      and\nuse the experience, and the framework, for these partnerships as well.\n\nBut
      we need to be realistic. In general, many see strategic partnerships\nas, well,
      of strategic importance. They expect great contributions,\nhowever small the
      partnership. And when it comes to the newest\ndevelopment of university alliances,
      expectations are even grander. Four\nuniversities involved in EVALUATE, including
      the universities where we\nare based, are part of [Una\nEuropa](https://www.una-europa.eu/about/manifesto){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\nalliance believes a university is created by and for society and as such\ndriven
      to be of relevance, impact and high quality. It is a laboratory\nof the here
      and now, where creativity and experimentation unlock the\nhidden potentials
      of tomorrow. Who is against this creed? Not many, we\nguess. But what does it
      mean in practice? What is the evidence? How can\nthis be assessed? Let''s talk
      about our partnership!\n\nEVALUATE is funded under ERASMUS+ Key Action 2.\n\nThis
      blogpost is based on the experience of the authors with the\nEVALUATE project
      and on the EVALUATE framework and handbook. Pictures\nare of EVALUATE meetings

      Several had discussed expectations and\nintentions with their partner universities,
      as well as within their own\nuniversity. Something they hardly did before. Moreover,
      they wanted to\nreach out to partner universities outside of Europe and Australia
      and\nuse the experience, and the framework, for these partnerships as well.\n\nBut
      we need to be realistic. In general, many see strategic partnerships\nas, well,
      of strategic importance. They expect great contributions,\nhowever small the
      partnership. And when it comes to the newest\ndevelopment of university alliances,
      expectations are even grander. Four\nuniversities involved in EVALUATE, including
      the universities where we\nare based, are part of [Una\nEuropa](https://www.una-europa.eu/about/manifesto){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The\nalliance believes a university is created by and for society and as such\ndriven
      to be of relevance, impact and high quality. It is a laboratory\nof the here
      and now, where creativity and experimentation unlock the\nhidden potentials
      of tomorrow. Who is against this creed? Not many, we\nguess. But what does it
      mean in practice? What is the evidence? How can\nthis be assessed? Let''s talk
      about our partnership!\n\nEVALUATE is funded under ERASMUS+ Key Action 2.\n\nThis
      blogpost is based on the experience of the authors with the\nEVALUATE project
      and on the EVALUATE framework and handbook. Pictures\nare of EVALUATE meetings
      and of the EVALUATE framework and handbook:\nEVALUATE project (2022): *[The

      intended to support developing expertise in areas related to UNESCO''s\nmandate,
      such as education, culture, communication and the natural and\nsocial sciences.
      This network of over 850 institutions in 117 countries\nmobilises knowledge
      to address pressing societal challenges and\ncontribute to development.\n\nUNESCO
      has developed the 2017 [Recommendation on Science and Scientific\nResearchers](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the 2021 [Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\"_blank\"},\nbuilding
      on the notions that science is a *common good*, that all\nhumankind should [enjoy
      the benefits of scientific\nknowledge](https://en.unesco.org/human-rights/science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      has the right to participate in it.\n\nIf you agree on this understanding of
      science as a *common good,* you\nmay reply: \"all right, yes, science is a common
      good, but right now:  \n\n- Who benefits from science?\n- Which type of research
      topics are considered important?\n- Who participates in making science and deciding
      which knowledge is\n  produced?\"\n\nThe answers to each of these questions
      point in the same direction:\nscience is heavily concentrated towards the interest
      of the privileged\nand it supports forms of innovation that [actively contribute
      to world\ninequalities](https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFor
      science to be a common good, there is a need for diversity and\ninclusion, which
      means:  \n\n- Widening the distribution of the benefits of science across\n  populations.\n-
      Pluralising research topics.\n- Broadening participation and activities in knowledge
      production, both\n  of citizens and the academic workforce.\n\nThe new CWTS
      UNESCO Chair on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science\naims to contribute
      to the implementation of the 2017 and 2021 UNESCO\nRecommendations through a
      focus on Diversity and Inclusion in Global\nScience, in collaboration with a
      variety of research and policy partners\nin the world.\n\n### **Why does the
      diversity of research topics matter for global science?**\n\nIt [has long been\nargued](https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2110158660/2110158660.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat,
      in general, diversity in research is beneficial because:\n\n- it fosters new
      ideas through recombination, for example in terms of\n  interdisciplinarity;\n-
      it is an insurance against incertitude, given that we don''t know what\n  the
      best solutions to problems are, it''s better to try out different\n  avenues;\n-
      it prevents research from lock-in, i.e., it keeps the flexibility to\n  adapt
      knowledge in the face of changing environments;\n- it accommodates plural perspectives,
      i.e., it allows science to\n  reflect the contrasting views on issues that exist
      in society.\n\nIf we think of science as a key element for improving well-being
      and\nhuman development, diversity of knowledge is even more important. This\nis
      because research agendas are too often concentrated towards the\nissues and
      the framings that are relevant to the Global North and for\npowerful or privileged
      actors.\n\nThe historical role of science in colonialism and environmental\ndegradation
      would be examples of this concentration of research towards\nthe interest of
      the powerful. On the contrary, there is relatively much\nless research in topics
      which are more relevant for example for women,\nthe Global South or some ethnic
      or indigenious groups.\n\n[Research efforts across\ndiseases](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      a classic example of this: there is little research not only in some\ntropical
      diseases such as malaria, but also in topics such as\ncardiovascular diseases
      which affect poor populations, in comparison to\ninvestments in diseases such
      as cancers which are relatively more\nfrequent in the richest populations.\n\n<figure>\n<img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/who.png\"\ndata-image=\"29852\"
      />\n</figure>\n\nAnother example of imbalance is [artificial\nintelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10385){target=\"_blank\"}.
      In\nthis case, research is concentrated in topics that are relevant to big\ncorporations
      rather than research involving other methods that are more\nuseful to consider
      the societal and ethical implications of AI.\n\nIn short, making the contents
      of research more diverse is important for\nscience to address the scientific
      problems associated with the\nchallenges that matter to most people in the world.\n\n###
      **Why is inclusion of social groups important for global science?**\n\nNow,
      for research to address a wider variety of topics, and especially\nsocietal
      challenges, it is necessary that science is more representative\nof the world
      population. Plural representation is both [a normative and\nsubstantive\nimperative](https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/12492/stirling_2005_opening.pdf?sequence=1).\nIn
      other words, researchers must come from a broader variety of social\nbackgrounds
      and citizens must participate more actively in shaping\nknowledge so that science
      is more democratic and reflects plural\ninterests and needs. For this purpose,
      science also needs to be created\nand shared in local languages (as suggested
      by the [*Helsinki Initiative\non Multilingualism*](https://www.helsinki-initiative.org/))
      and through\n[open scholarly\ninfrastructures](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).\n\nIn
      recent decades, science is already undergoing a transformation in\nthis direction,
      with the growth of [citizen\nscience](https://www.nature.com/collections/cihfchiheh),
      and the\nincreasing participation of concerned groups such as\n[patients](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/engagement-and-participation-in-research/involve-patients.htm),\nor
      marginalised groups in dimensions such as\n[gender](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/shefigures2021/index.html),\nethnicity
      or Global South countries.\n\nHowever, many social groups still remain heavily
      underrepresented and\n[face discriminatory working\nconditions](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-022-00031-8/index.html)\nor
      lack of academic freedom, and stakeholder engagement in science\nremains a challenge.
      There is still a lot of progress to be made so that\nscience reflects the plurality
      of world societies.\n\n### **How will the CWTS Chair contribute to UNESCO''s
      agenda?**\n\nGiven the expertise of CWTS on S&T indicators and research assessment,\nour
      Chair aims to provide evidence to raise awareness on existing\nproblems in diversity
      and inclusion in world science. We will work\nmainly along two complementary
      lines.\n\n**First, developing monitoring methods** that illuminate progress
      in the\nadoption of the 2017 [Recommendation on Science and Scientific\nResearchers](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      the recent [Recommendation on Open\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\"_blank\"},\nwith
      a focus on making knowledge more accessible, representative and\nparticipatory.\n\nThe
      monitoring methods for these recommendations are not straightforward\nat all
      because they are related to values and need contextualisation. We\nhave to go
      beyond existing statistical methods. To do so, we will build\non expertise developed
      in projects for monitoring *Responsible Research\nand Innovation*, in particular\n[SuperMoRRI.](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n**Second,developinga
      multi-perspective observatory of global scholarly\ncommunication** (let''s call
      it a ***Multiversatory***!), focusing on\nmaking visible outputs and activities
      of the global academic community\nwhich are currently invisible. A classical
      example is the exclusion of\nnational and local scientific journals from mainstream
      scientometric\ndatabases. So far, the global research landscape has been mapped
      using\nselective commercial databases which miss a large share of all\nscientific
      publications, particularly from journals in the social\nsciences and humanities
      and from the Global South.\n\nHowever, more comprehensive open databases such
      as\n[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"} and\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      are becoming\nincreasingly available. These databases provide a more inclusive
      (though\nstill incomplete) coverage for the Global South and also allows\ncomparison
      of how visibility differs depending on perspectives. We\nbelieve that with these
      new databases a step change will be soon made in\nthe analysis of the geography
      of scholarly communication. We expect to\nshow that [world science is actually
      more diverse than is frequently\nbelieved](https://preprints.scielo.org/index.php/scielo/preprint/view/4729/version/5022){target=\"_blank\"},\nbut
      that many parts of the knowledge created often remain invisible.  \n", "images":

      This network of over 850 institutions in 117 countries\\nmobilises knowledge
      to address pressing societal challenges and\\ncontribute to development.\\n\\nUNESCO
      has developed the 2017 [Recommendation on Science and Scientific\\nResearchers](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the 2021 [Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nbuilding
      on the notions that science is a *common good*, that all\\nhumankind should
      [enjoy the benefits of scientific\\nknowledge](https://en.unesco.org/human-rights/science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      has the right to participate in it.\\n\\nIf you agree on this understanding
      of science as a *common good,* you\\nmay reply: \\\"all right, yes, science
      is a common good, but right now:  \\n\\n- Who benefits from science?\\n- Which
      type of research topics are considered important?\\n- Who participates in making
      science and deciding which knowledge is\\n  produced?\\\"\\n\\nThe answers to
      each of these questions point in the same direction:\\nscience is heavily concentrated
      towards the interest of the privileged\\nand it supports forms of innovation
      that [actively contribute to world\\ninequalities](https://issues.org/public-value-science-innovation-equity-bozeman/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nFor
      science to be a common good, there is a need for diversity and\\ninclusion,
      which means:  \\n\\n- Widening the distribution of the benefits of science across\\n
      \ populations.\\n- Pluralising research topics.\\n- Broadening participation
      and activities in knowledge production, both\\n  of citizens and the academic
      workforce.\\n\\nThe new CWTS UNESCO Chair on Diversity and Inclusion in Global
      Science\\naims to contribute to the implementation of the 2017 and 2021 UNESCO\\nRecommendations
      through a focus on Diversity and Inclusion in Global\\nScience, in collaboration
      with a variety of research and policy partners\\nin the world.\\n\\n### **Why
      does the diversity of research topics matter for global science?**\\n\\nIt [has
      long been\\nargued](https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2110158660/2110158660.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nthat,
      in general, diversity in research is beneficial because:\\n\\n- it fosters new
      ideas through recombination, for example in terms of\\n  interdisciplinarity;\\n-
      it is an insurance against incertitude, given that we don't know what\\n  the
      best solutions to problems are, it's better to try out different\\n  avenues;\\n-
      it prevents research from lock-in, i.e., it keeps the flexibility to\\n  adapt
      knowledge in the face of changing environments;\\n- it accommodates plural perspectives,
      i.e., it allows science to\\n  reflect the contrasting views on issues that
      exist in society.\\n\\nIf we think of science as a key element for improving
      well-being and\\nhuman development, diversity of knowledge is even more important.
      This\\nis because research agendas are too often concentrated towards the\\nissues
      and the framings that are relevant to the Global North and for\\npowerful or
      privileged actors.\\n\\nThe historical role of science in colonialism and environmental\\ndegradation
      would be examples of this concentration of research towards\\nthe interest of
      the powerful. On the contrary, there is relatively much\\nless research in topics
      which are more relevant for example for women,\\nthe Global South or some ethnic
      or indigenious groups.\\n\\n[Research efforts across\\ndiseases](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/mar/16/who-benefits-from-biomedical-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      a classic example of this: there is little research not only in some\\ntropical
      diseases such as malaria, but also in topics such as\\ncardiovascular diseases
      which affect poor populations, in comparison to\\ninvestments in diseases such
      as cancers which are relatively more\\nfrequent in the richest populations.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/who.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"29852\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nAnother example of imbalance is [artificial\\nintelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10385){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      In\\nthis case, research is concentrated in topics that are relevant to big\\ncorporations
      rather than research involving other methods that are more\\nuseful to consider
      the societal and ethical implications of AI.\\n\\nIn short, making the contents
      of research more diverse is important for\\nscience to address the scientific
      problems associated with the\\nchallenges that matter to most people in the
      world.\\n\\n### **Why is inclusion of social groups important for global science?**\\n\\nNow,
      for research to address a wider variety of topics, and especially\\nsocietal
      challenges, it is necessary that science is more representative\\nof the world
      population. Plural representation is both [a normative and\\nsubstantive\\nimperative](https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/12492/stirling_2005_opening.pdf?sequence=1).\\nIn
      other words, researchers must come from a broader variety of social\\nbackgrounds
      and citizens must participate more actively in shaping\\nknowledge so that science
      is more democratic and reflects plural\\ninterests and needs. For this purpose,
      science also needs to be created\\nand shared in local languages (as suggested
      by the [*Helsinki Initiative\\non Multilingualism*](https://www.helsinki-initiative.org/))
      and through\\n[open scholarly\\ninfrastructures](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).\\n\\nIn
      recent decades, science is already undergoing a transformation in\\nthis direction,
      with the growth of [citizen\\nscience](https://www.nature.com/collections/cihfchiheh),
      and the\\nincreasing participation of concerned groups such as\\n[patients](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/engagement-and-participation-in-research/involve-patients.htm),\\nor
      marginalised groups in dimensions such as\\n[gender](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/shefigures2021/index.html),\\nethnicity
      or Global South countries.\\n\\nHowever, many social groups still remain heavily
      underrepresented and\\n[face discriminatory working\\nconditions](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-022-00031-8/index.html)\\nor
      lack of academic freedom, and stakeholder engagement in science\\nremains a
      challenge. There is still a lot of progress to be made so that\\nscience reflects
      the plurality of world societies.\\n\\n### **How will the CWTS Chair contribute
      to UNESCO's agenda?**\\n\\nGiven the expertise of CWTS on S&T indicators and
      research assessment,\\nour Chair aims to provide evidence to raise awareness
      on existing\\nproblems in diversity and inclusion in world science. We will
      work\\nmainly along two complementary lines.\\n\\n**First, developing monitoring
      methods** that illuminate progress in the\\nadoption of the 2017 [Recommendation
      on Science and Scientific\\nResearchers](https://en.unesco.org/themes/ethics-science-and-technology/recommendation_science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      the recent [Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwith
      a focus on making knowledge more accessible, representative and\\nparticipatory.\\n\\nThe
      monitoring methods for these recommendations are not straightforward\\nat all
      because they are related to values and need contextualisation. We\\nhave to
      go beyond existing statistical methods. To do so, we will build\\non expertise

      "content_text": "The idea for this blog post emerged in the context of a special
      issue\nwith the online journal [*Frontiers in Research Metrics and\nAnalytics*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe,
      a group of researchers that can broadly be associated with science &\ntechnology
      studies and meta-research, were invited by Frontiers to guest\nedit what they
      call a ''Research Topic'', suggesting it could focus on\ninnovations in peer
      review practices. We accepted the invitation, and\nsubsequently launched a call
      for contributions around the topic of\n\"Change and Innovation in Manuscript
      Peer Review\". The resulting\n[collection](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/17324/change-and-innovation-in-manuscript-peer-review-the-effects-on-the-research-process){target=\"_blank\"}\nappeared
      in January 2022 and contains six articles we are very proud of.\nThey touch
      on such topics as the specificities of peer review in law\njournals, the changing
      role of (guest) editors amidst increased use of\neditorial management systems,
      and mechanisms and labels to assure\nquality in book publishing.\n\nWe were
      aware of previous criticism of Frontiers'' approach to scholarly\npublishing
      (see for instance\n[here](https://forbetterscience.com/2015/10/28/is-frontiers-a-potential-predatory-publisher/){target=\"_blank\"},\nor\n[here](https://twitter.com/MaraMather/status/1581300436836921344){target=\"_blank\"}\nfor
      a recent example) and intensively discussed whether we should embark\non this
      project. We came to the conclusion that the topic is important\nand timely,
      especially in the context of a journal that itself\nrepresents (and pushes)
      new peer review and editorial practices. That\nsaid, working with Frontiers
      forced us to develop a form of reflexivity\nabout our own publishing process
      we would have rather liked to do\nwithout. More specifically, we aimed to publish
      our reflections on the\neditorial practices we encountered during our editorship
      as part of the\nintroduction to the Research Topic, but Frontiers did not allow
      us to.\nAfter more than half a year of discussions - and particularly long\nperiods
      of silence from Frontiers - we decided to publish our editorial\nas a [preprint](https://osf.io/ksg6q){target=\"_blank\"}
      and write this\nblog post to inform the scientific community about our experiences.\n\n###
      Concerns about the editorial process\n\nOur worries began with the organisation
      of the peer review process\nitself. Frontiers forces users into a relatively
      rigid workflow that\nforesees contacting a large number of potential reviewers
      for\nsubmissions. Reviewers are selected by an internal artificial\nintelligence
      algorithm on the basis of keywords automatically attributed\nby the algorithm
      based on the content of the submitted manuscript and\nmatched with a database
      of potential reviewers, a technique somewhat\nsimilar to the one used for reviewer
      databases of other big publishers.\nWhile the importance of the keywords for
      the match can be manually\nadjusted, the fit between submissions and the actually
      required domain\nexpertise to review them is often less than perfect. This would
      not be a\nproblem were the process of contacting reviewers fully under the control\nof
      the editors. Yet the numerous potential reviewers are contacted by\nmeans of
      a preformulated email in a quasi-automated fashion, apparently\nunder the assumption
      that many of them will reject anyway. We find this\nto be problematic because
      it ultimately erodes the willingness of\nacademics to donate their time for
      unpaid but absolutely vital community\nservice. In addition, in some cases it
      resulted in reviewers being\nassigned to papers in our Research Topic that we
      believed were not\nqualified to perform reviews. Significant amounts of emailing
      and\nback-and-forth with managing editors and Frontiers staff were required\nto
      bypass this system, retract review invitations and instead focus only\non the
      reviewers we actually wanted to contact. As it turns out, the\neditorial management
      system is so rigidly set up, that even Frontiers''\nown staff does not always
      have the ability to adjust key settings.\n\nAnother concern we had is the pacing
      of the review and publication\nprocess. Frontiers aims to avoid unnecessary
      delays in the reviewing of\nsubmissions, a goal we wholeheartedly subscribe
      to. Yet the intended\nworkflow is such that reviewers have only seven days to
      complete their\nreports as a default, with the possibility to extend the deadline
      to\ntwenty-one days - however, again at the cost of a cumbersome process of\nemailing
      with Frontiers staff. Also, automatically generated review\ninvitations as described
      above are sent out if the editors do not send\nout sufficiently many review
      invitations themselves within three days,\nincluding weekends, holidays and
      (as was the case with us) summer\nbreaks. While we see how short deadlines can
      contribute to fast\ndissemination, we feel that the current standards might
      jeopardize the\nquality of the review process.\n\nA third element of the rigidly
      organised review process we found to be a\nmixed blessing concerns the level
      of editorial control that editors\nmaintain.\u00a0In fact, editors are encouraged
      to\u00a0accept manuscripts as soon\nas they receive two recommendations\u00a0for
      publication by reviewers\n(regardless of how many other reviewers recommend
      rejection). This holds\nfor all review rounds. Especially in combination with
      the factors\nmentioned above, i.e. potentially unqualified reviewers being invited\nand
      high requirements on review speed, this potentially creates\nadditional challenges
      to the quality of the editorial process.\n\n### Hindered to voice reflections\n\nAs
      referred to before, a learning experience of a questionable sort was\nour attempt
      to publish an editorial that reflected on these issues. We\nnaturally intended
      to include our editorial in the very special issue we\nedited. However, upon
      submission of our draft we received a message\ninforming us that our text was
      not in accordance with the guidelines of\nFrontiers. They insisted that the
      text could not be published unless we\ntook out the two paragraphs of rather
      critical reflections on Frontiers''\neditorial process. We insisted that these
      reflections were an essential\nelement of our editorial and closely related
      to the content of our\nResearch Topic, which dealt with the impact of editorial
      processes on\nknowledge production and dissemination. In addition, we felt that
      being\nforced to erase the reflections drastically impacted on our editorial\nfreedom.
      This then led to several emails back and forth, among others\nincluding Frontiers''
      head of research integrity and various in-house\neditorial staff members. When
      the issue could not be resolved through\ncorrespondence, we ultimately scheduled
      a zoom call with Frontiers''\nChief Executive Editor (CEE). We once again explained
      our stance\nregarding the appropriateness of reflecting on our editorial process
      in\nour editorial.\n\nIn our meeting, the CEE confirmed that such a reflective
      element was\nappropriate and that Frontiers was of course ''very willing to
      listen to\nour feedback''. However, he felt that an editorial was not the right\nplace
      to voice such reflections. There were concerns about \"our\neditorial lacking
      context\". Apparently, the issues we identified were\nspecific to our own process
      and were in no way indicative of Frontiers''\ngeneral practices. We have reasons
      to doubt the veracity of this claim.\n\nSubsequently, we were promised that
      the CEE would come up with a\nsuggested solution to the situation in the week
      following our call.\nAfter four months and six reminders, we have still not
      heard back from\nFrontiers. That is why we decided to publish our editorial
      as a preprint\n(in line with Frontiers'' own preprint policies) and publish
      this blog\npost to inform the scientific community about our process. We informed\nthe
      Frontiers staff about the publication of the preprint and this blog\npost in
      advance, but once again without response from their side.\n\n### Towards open
      scholarly debate\n\nBy writing this blog, we aim to share our experiences as
      guest editors\nat Frontiers, contributing to the ongoing debate about changing\npublishing
      and editorial models. We are generally in favour of improving\nand innovating
      editorial and peer review processes and find several\nelements of Frontiers''
      editorial model interesting, including the Open\nIdentities and Open Reports
      formats of review, and creating a forum for\nauthors, reviewers and editors
      to interact. However, we have concerns\nabout other elements, believing that
      they affect the quality and\nintegrity of the process and published record.
      We believe that openness\nabout our experiences is important to support stakeholders
      in making\ninformed decisions about how, where and with whom to engage in the\npublishing
      process. We much regret Frontiers'' attempts to hinder an open\ndiscussion about
      these aspects. Despite our reflections not being part\nof the Research Topic,
      where we still feel they would have fitted best,\nwe hope our editorial/preprint
      and this blog post can trigger the open\nscholarly debate we believe to be essential.  \n\n[  \nHeader

      a recent example) and intensively discussed whether we should embark\\non this
      project. We came to the conclusion that the topic is important\\nand timely,
      especially in the context of a journal that itself\\nrepresents (and pushes)
      new peer review and editorial practices. That\\nsaid, working with Frontiers
      forced us to develop a form of reflexivity\\nabout our own publishing process
      we would have rather liked to do\\nwithout. More specifically, we aimed to publish
      our reflections on the\\neditorial practices we encountered during our editorship
      as part of the\\nintroduction to the Research Topic, but Frontiers did not allow
      us to.\\nAfter more than half a year of discussions - and particularly long\\nperiods
      of silence from Frontiers - we decided to publish our editorial\\nas a [preprint](https://osf.io/ksg6q){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and write this\\nblog post to inform the scientific community about our experiences.\\n\\n###
      Concerns about the editorial process\\n\\nOur worries began with the organisation
      of the peer review process\\nitself. Frontiers forces users into a relatively
      rigid workflow that\\nforesees contacting a large number of potential reviewers
      for\\nsubmissions. Reviewers are selected by an internal artificial\\nintelligence
      algorithm on the basis of keywords automatically attributed\\nby the algorithm
      based on the content of the submitted manuscript and\\nmatched with a database
      of potential reviewers, a technique somewhat\\nsimilar to the one used for reviewer
      databases of other big publishers.\\nWhile the importance of the keywords for
      the match can be manually\\nadjusted, the fit between submissions and the actually
      required domain\\nexpertise to review them is often less than perfect. This
      would not be a\\nproblem were the process of contacting reviewers fully under
      the control\\nof the editors. Yet the numerous potential reviewers are contacted
      by\\nmeans of a preformulated email in a quasi-automated fashion, apparently\\nunder
      the assumption that many of them will reject anyway. We find this\\nto be problematic
      because it ultimately erodes the willingness of\\nacademics to donate their
      time for unpaid but absolutely vital community\\nservice. In addition, in some
      cases it resulted in reviewers being\\nassigned to papers in our Research Topic
      that we believed were not\\nqualified to perform reviews. Significant amounts
      of emailing and\\nback-and-forth with managing editors and Frontiers staff were
      required\\nto bypass this system, retract review invitations and instead focus
      only\\non the reviewers we actually wanted to contact. As it turns out, the\\neditorial
      management system is so rigidly set up, that even Frontiers'\\nown staff does
      not always have the ability to adjust key settings.\\n\\nAnother concern we
      had is the pacing of the review and publication\\nprocess. Frontiers aims to
      avoid unnecessary delays in the reviewing of\\nsubmissions, a goal we wholeheartedly
      subscribe to. Yet the intended\\nworkflow is such that reviewers have only seven
      days to complete their\\nreports as a default, with the possibility to extend
      the deadline to\\ntwenty-one days - however, again at the cost of a cumbersome
      process of\\nemailing with Frontiers staff. Also, automatically generated review\\ninvitations
      as described above are sent out if the editors do not send\\nout sufficiently
      many review invitations themselves within three days,\\nincluding weekends,
      holidays and (as was the case with us) summer\\nbreaks. While we see how short
      deadlines can contribute to fast\\ndissemination, we feel that the current standards
      might jeopardize the\\nquality of the review process.\\n\\nA third element of
      the rigidly organised review process we found to be a\\nmixed blessing concerns
      the level of editorial control that editors\\nmaintain.\_In fact, editors are
      encouraged to\_accept manuscripts as soon\\nas they receive two recommendations\_for
      publication by reviewers\\n(regardless of how many other reviewers recommend
      rejection). This holds\\nfor all review rounds. Especially in combination with
      the factors\\nmentioned above, i.e. potentially unqualified reviewers being
      invited\\nand high requirements on review speed, this potentially creates\\nadditional
      challenges to the quality of the editorial process.\\n\\n### Hindered to voice
      reflections\\n\\nAs referred to before, a learning experience of a questionable
      sort was\\nour attempt to publish an editorial that reflected on these issues.
      We\\nnaturally intended to include our editorial in the very special issue we\\nedited.
      However, upon submission of our draft we received a message\\ninforming us that
      our text was not in accordance with the guidelines of\\nFrontiers. They insisted
      that the text could not be published unless we\\ntook out the two paragraphs
      of rather critical reflections on Frontiers'\\neditorial process. We insisted
      that these reflections were an essential\\nelement of our editorial and closely
      related to the content of our\\nResearch Topic, which dealt with the impact
      of editorial processes on\\nknowledge production and dissemination. In addition,
      we felt that being\\nforced to erase the reflections drastically impacted on
      our editorial\\nfreedom. This then led to several emails back and forth, among
      others\\nincluding Frontiers' head of research integrity and various in-house\\neditorial
      staff members. When the issue could not be resolved through\\ncorrespondence,
      we ultimately scheduled a zoom call with Frontiers'\\nChief Executive Editor
      (CEE). We once again explained our stance\\nregarding the appropriateness of
      reflecting on our editorial process in\\nour editorial.\\n\\nIn our meeting,
      the CEE confirmed that such a reflective element was\\nappropriate and that
      Frontiers was of course 'very willing to listen to\\nour feedback'. However,
      he felt that an editorial was not the right\\nplace to voice such reflections.
      There were concerns about \\\"our\\neditorial lacking context\\\". Apparently,
      the issues we identified were\\nspecific to our own process and were in no way
      indicative of Frontiers'\\ngeneral practices. We have reasons to doubt the veracity
      of this claim.\\n\\nSubsequently, we were promised that the CEE would come up
      with a\\nsuggested solution to the situation in the week following our call.\\nAfter
      four months and six reminders, we have still not heard back from\\nFrontiers.
      That is why we decided to publish our editorial as a preprint\\n(in line with
      Frontiers' own preprint policies) and publish this blog\\npost to inform the
      scientific community about our process. We informed\\nthe Frontiers staff about
      the publication of the preprint and this blog\\npost in advance, but once again
      without response from their side.\\n\\n### Towards open scholarly debate\\n\\nBy
      writing this blog, we aim to share our experiences as guest editors\\nat Frontiers,
      contributing to the ongoing debate about changing\\npublishing and editorial
      models. We are generally in favour of improving\\nand innovating editorial and
      peer review processes and find several\\nelements of Frontiers' editorial model
      interesting, including the Open\\nIdentities and Open Reports formats of review,
      and creating a forum for\\nauthors, reviewers and editors to interact. However,
      we have concerns\\nabout other elements, believing that they affect the quality
      and\\nintegrity of the process and published record. We believe that openness\\nabout
      our experiences is important to support stakeholders in making\\ninformed decisions
      about how, where and with whom to engage in the\\npublishing process. We much
      regret Frontiers' attempts to hinder an open\\ndiscussion about these aspects.
      Despite our reflections not being part\\nof the Research Topic, where we still
      feel they would have fitted best,\\nwe hope our editorial/preprint and this
      blog post can trigger the open\\nscholarly debate we believe to be essential.

      about how, where and with whom to engage in the\\npublishing process. We much
      regret Frontiers' attempts to hinder an open\\ndiscussion about these aspects.
      Despite our reflections not being part\\nof the Research Topic, where we still
      feel they would have fitted best,\\nwe hope our editorial/preprint and this

      it important that abstracts are made openly available?\n\nIn a [blog\npost](https://medium.com/a-academic-librarians-thoughts-on-open-access/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs-bb7bde1ed751){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      we published two years ago together with our colleague Aaron Tay,\nwe discussed
      numerous ways in which open abstracts can be of great\nvalue. This includes
      scientific literature search, both using\ntraditional query-based search tools
      and using more advanced text mining\nand visualization tools. It also includes
      the analysis of the structure\nand dynamics of research fields using bibliometric
      visualization tools\nsuch as [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[CiteSpace](http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      addition, we pointed out that open abstracts can be used to support\nsystematic
      literature reviewing, to algorithmically identify relations\nbetween scholarly
      outputs, to assign these outputs to research topics or\nresearch fields, and
      to enable automatic knowledge extraction, for\ninstance by algorithmically identifying
      biomedical entities and\ngene-disease associations.\n\nPublishers typically
      make abstracts freely available on their websites.\nHowever, to support the
      above use cases, it is essential that abstracts\nare openly available in a centralized
      infrastructure. For publishers\nthat work with [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      to\nregister DOIs for their content, the [Initiative for Open Abstracts\n(I4OA)](https://i4oa.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      recommends making abstracts\nopenly available through Crossref.  \n\n### Many
      other publishers have already opened their abstracts. What is the significance
      of the step taken by Wiley? {#many-other-publishers-have-already-opened-their-abstracts.-what-is-the-significance-of-the-step-taken-by-wiley}\n\nIndeed
      many publishers have already opened their abstracts, and of these\npublishers
      100 are also [formal supporters of\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/#publishers){target=\"_blank\"}.
      This includes\nHindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE, three of the [founding organizations\nof
      I4OA](https://i4oa.org/#founders){target=\"_blank\"}. Abstracts are\ncurrently
      openly available for 39% of the journal articles in Crossref\nin the period
      2020-2022. Until today, however, of the world''s five\nlargest publishers, in
      terms of number of journal articles, MDPI was the\nonly one supporting I4OA.
      Of these five publishers, [Wiley is now the\nsecond one joining\nI4OA](https://www.wiley.com/network/researchers/open-research/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      follows the example of Hindawi, which was acquired by Wiley last\nyear. Given
      that Wiley published 6% of the journal articles in Crossref\nin the period 2020-2022,
      we see Wiley''s support for I4OA as an important\nmilestone for openness of
      abstracts.  \n\n### What do you expect other large publishers will do?\n\nWith
      support for I4OA from the world''s third (Wiley) and fourth (MDPI)\nlargest
      publisher, we do not see any credible argument for other large\npublishers,
      in particular Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Taylor &\nFrancis, to withhold
      their support for open abstracts.\n\nSpringer Nature is under pressure from
      the [editors of its flagship\njournal\n*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02915-1){target=\"_blank\"}\nto
      support open abstracts. It is already making abstracts openly\navailable through
      Crossref for its open access content, but unlike Wiley\nand other publishers
      supporting I4OA, its policy is not to make\nabstracts openly available for its
      subscription content. Extending its\nsupport for open abstracts to all its content
      seems a natural next step\nfor Springer Nature.\n\nWhile it may take a bit more
      time, we expect that Taylor & Francis and\nElsevier will follow as well. Taylor
      & Francis has a daughter company,\nF1000, that was one of the [initial supporters
      of\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/press.html#pressrelease){target=\"_blank\"}. We do\nnot
      see any reason for Taylor & Francis not to follow the example of its\ndaughter
      company.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to protect its Scopus business, Elsevier\ninitially
      declined to open its citations, despite [strong protest from\nthe scientometric\ncommunity](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/14/elsevier-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal){target=\"_blank\"}.\nHowever,
      in 2020, Elsevier changed its position and [joined the\nInitiative for Open
      Citations\n(I4OC)](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/q-a-about-elseviers-decision-to-open-its-citation){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOf
      the larger publishers, Elsevier was one of the last ones to open its\ncitations.
      To prevent this history from repeating itself, we are hopeful\nthat Elsevier
      will act more swiftly in opening its abstracts.  \n\n### How does the step taken
      by Wiley fit into the bigger picture of openness of metadata of scholarly outputs?\n\nWhile
      openness of abstracts and citations is of critical importance, it\nis of limited
      value if other metadata is not made openly available as\nwell. This for instance
      includes affiliation and funding metadata,\nlicense information, and links between
      scholarly outputs, such as links\nbetween preprints and the corresponding journal
      articles or between\njournal articles and the associated data sets. This metadata
      should as\nmuch as possible make use of openly-governed persistent identifiers,
      for\ninstance [ORCID](https://orcid.org/){target=\"_blank\"} and\n[ROR](https://ror.org/){target=\"_blank\"}
      identifiers.\n\nAs can be seen in the figure below, in recent years publishers
      have made\nsignificant progress in making metadata of journal articles openly\navailable
      through Crossref. More detailed statistics reported in [this\npreprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5){target=\"_blank\"}
      show\nthat Wiley is doing a good job by making affiliation metadata openly\navailable.
      Other large publishers, such as Elsevier, Springer Nature,\nand MDPI, have not
      yet taken this step. Like many publishers, Wiley is\nalso making funding metadata
      openly available. However, as shown in\nrecent analyses (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210){target=\"_blank\"}), for many\npublishers
      the funding metadata made available through Crossref suffers\nfrom gaps and
      other quality issues.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/QA-about-Wiley\u2019s-decision-to-open-its-abstracts_image1.png\"\ndata-image=\"29565\"\nalt=\"rcentage
      of journal articles with open metadata in Crossref.\" />\n</figure>\n\n[Percentage
      of journal articles with open metadata in Crossref. Source:\n[Van Eck & Waltman
      (2022, Figure\n2)](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n]{.caption
      dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nIn some cases, metadata that is not made available through Crossref
      can\nbe obtained from other open data sources, such as\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      OpenAlex collects\naffiliation metadata from publisher websites and makes this
      metadata\nopenly available. As shown in a [recent\nanalysis](https://github.com/Curtin-Open-Knowledge-Initiative/open-metadata-report/blob/main/reports/run_20221008_1/report_template_singleDB.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nperformed
      by one of us, OpenAlex is able to provide affiliation metadata\nfor publishers
      that do not deposit this metadata to Crossref. However,\nthis metadata has not
      been ''authorized'' by publishers and may suffer\nfrom inaccuracies due to technical
      challenges in the algorithmic\nextraction of metadata from publisher websites.\n\nSimilarly,
      OpenAlex is able to provide abstracts for 75-80% of the\nrecent journal articles
      in Crossref, partly by scraping abstracts from\npublisher websites, which might
      cause accuracy issues. These abstracts\nare made available in an ''inverted
      format'' (i.e., as a list of\nindividual words with location indicators) for
      copyright reasons, which\nis somewhat cumbersome and potentially less sustainable
      than having\nabstracts made available by publishers in their Crossref metadata.\n\n###
      How can researchers and other actors in the research community contribute to
      openness of abstracts and other metadata?\n\nRealizing openness of abstracts
      and other metadata requires significant\nefforts by publishers and their technology
      providers, and also by the\nteam of Crossref. Other actors in the research community
      can contribute\nas well, in particular by showing the value they attach to open\nmetadata.\n\nResearchers
      can contribute by taking openness of metadata, including\nabstracts, into account
      when choosing the journal to which they submit\ntheir work. Openness of metadata
      will reduce the dependency on\nproprietary platforms such as Scopus and Web
      of Science for discovery of\nresearch and assessment of researchers. Crossref
      provides [Participation\nReports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that\nresearchers can use to get a quick overview of the metadata that a\npublisher
      makes openly available through Crossref.\n\nResearch funders can make a contribution
      by including openness of\nmetadata as a requirement in their open access policies.
      This is for\ninstance already done in [Plan\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/technical-guidance_and_requirements/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nLikewise,
      research institutions and their libraries can contribute by\nincluding openness
      of metadata in their negotiations with publishers, as\nsuggested by the [TIB\nlibrary](https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2020/09/24/tib-supports-initiative-for-open-abstracts-i4oa/){target=\"_blank\"},\none
      of the more than 60 [stakeholders supporting\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/#stakeholders){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nIf
      you would like to contribute to openness of abstracts, the I4OA team\nis happy
      to help. Feel free to reach out, either on\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/open_abstracts){target=\"_blank\"}

      As shown in a [recent\\nanalysis](https://github.com/Curtin-Open-Knowledge-Initiative/open-metadata-report/blob/main/reports/run_20221008_1/report_template_singleDB.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nperformed
      by one of us, OpenAlex is able to provide affiliation metadata\\nfor publishers
      that do not deposit this metadata to Crossref. However,\\nthis metadata has
      not been 'authorized' by publishers and may suffer\\nfrom inaccuracies due to
      technical challenges in the algorithmic\\nextraction of metadata from publisher
      websites.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAlex is able to provide abstracts for 75-80% of
      the\\nrecent journal articles in Crossref, partly by scraping abstracts from\\npublisher
      websites, which might cause accuracy issues. These abstracts\\nare made available
      in an 'inverted format' (i.e., as a list of\\nindividual words with location
      indicators) for copyright reasons, which\\nis somewhat cumbersome and potentially
      less sustainable than having\\nabstracts made available by publishers in their
      Crossref metadata.\\n\\n### How can researchers and other actors in the research
      community contribute to openness of abstracts and other metadata?\\n\\nRealizing
      openness of abstracts and other metadata requires significant\\nefforts by publishers
      and their technology providers, and also by the\\nteam of Crossref. Other actors
      in the research community can contribute\\nas well, in particular by showing
      the value they attach to open\\nmetadata.\\n\\nResearchers can contribute by
      taking openness of metadata, including\\nabstracts, into account when choosing
      the journal to which they submit\\ntheir work. Openness of metadata will reduce
      the dependency on\\nproprietary platforms such as Scopus and Web of Science
      for discovery of\\nresearch and assessment of researchers. Crossref provides
      [Participation\\nReports](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      that\\nresearchers can use to get a quick overview of the metadata that a\\npublisher
      makes openly available through Crossref.\\n\\nResearch funders can make a contribution
      by including openness of\\nmetadata as a requirement in their open access policies.
      This is for\\ninstance already done in [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/technical-guidance_and_requirements/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nLikewise,
      research institutions and their libraries can contribute by\\nincluding openness
      of metadata in their negotiations with publishers, as\\nsuggested by the [TIB\\nlibrary](https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2020/09/24/tib-supports-initiative-for-open-abstracts-i4oa/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\none

      we published two years ago together with our colleague Aaron Tay,\\nwe discussed
      numerous ways in which open abstracts can be of great\\nvalue. This includes
      scientific literature search, both using\\ntraditional query-based search tools
      and using more advanced text mining\\nand visualization tools. It also includes
      the analysis of the structure\\nand dynamics of research fields using bibliometric
      visualization tools\\nsuch as [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[CiteSpace](http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIn
      addition, we pointed out that open abstracts can be used to support\\nsystematic
      literature reviewing, to algorithmically identify relations\\nbetween scholarly
      outputs, to assign these outputs to research topics or\\nresearch fields, and
      to enable automatic knowledge extraction, for\\ninstance by algorithmically
      identifying biomedical entities and\\ngene-disease associations.\\n\\nPublishers
      typically make abstracts freely available on their websites.\\nHowever, to support
      the above use cases, it is essential that abstracts\\nare openly available in
      a centralized infrastructure. For publishers\\nthat work with [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      to\\nregister DOIs for their content, the [Initiative for Open Abstracts\\n(I4OA)](https://i4oa.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      recommends making abstracts\\nopenly available through Crossref.  \\n\\n###
      Many other publishers have already opened their abstracts. What is the significance
      of the step taken by Wiley? {#many-other-publishers-have-already-opened-their-abstracts.-what-is-the-significance-of-the-step-taken-by-wiley}\\n\\nIndeed
      many publishers have already opened their abstracts, and of these\\npublishers
      100 are also [formal supporters of\\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/#publishers){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      This includes\\nHindawi, Royal Society, and SAGE, three of the [founding organizations\\nof
      I4OA](https://i4oa.org/#founders){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. Abstracts are\\ncurrently
      openly available for 39% of the journal articles in Crossref\\nin the period
      2020-2022. Until today, however, of the world's five\\nlargest publishers, in
      terms of number of journal articles, MDPI was the\\nonly one supporting I4OA.
      Of these five publishers, [Wiley is now the\\nsecond one joining\\nI4OA](https://www.wiley.com/network/researchers/open-research/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nIt
      follows the example of Hindawi, which was acquired by Wiley last\\nyear. Given
      that Wiley published 6% of the journal articles in Crossref\\nin the period
      2020-2022, we see Wiley's support for I4OA as an important\\nmilestone for openness
      of abstracts.  \\n\\n### What do you expect other large publishers will do?\\n\\nWith
      support for I4OA from the world's third (Wiley) and fourth (MDPI)\\nlargest
      publisher, we do not see any credible argument for other large\\npublishers,
      in particular Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Taylor &\\nFrancis, to withhold
      their support for open abstracts.\\n\\nSpringer Nature is under pressure from
      the [editors of its flagship\\njournal\\n*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-02915-1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nto
      support open abstracts. It is already making abstracts openly\\navailable through
      Crossref for its open access content, but unlike Wiley\\nand other publishers
      supporting I4OA, its policy is not to make\\nabstracts openly available for
      its subscription content. Extending its\\nsupport for open abstracts to all
      its content seems a natural next step\\nfor Springer Nature.\\n\\nWhile it may
      take a bit more time, we expect that Taylor & Francis and\\nElsevier will follow
      as well. Taylor & Francis has a daughter company,\\nF1000, that was one of the
      [initial supporters of\\nI4OA](https://i4oa.org/press.html#pressrelease){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      We do\\nnot see any reason for Taylor & Francis not to follow the example of
      its\\ndaughter company.\\n\\nIn an apparent attempt to protect its Scopus business,
      Elsevier\\ninitially declined to open its citations, despite [strong protest
      from\\nthe scientometric\\ncommunity](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/14/elsevier-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      in 2020, Elsevier changed its position and [joined the\\nInitiative for Open
      Citations\\n(I4OC)](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/q-a-about-elseviers-decision-to-open-its-citation){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nOf
      the larger publishers, Elsevier was one of the last ones to open its\\ncitations.
      To prevent this history from repeating itself, we are hopeful\\nthat Elsevier
      will act more swiftly in opening its abstracts.  \\n\\n### How does the step
      taken by Wiley fit into the bigger picture of openness of metadata of scholarly
      outputs?\\n\\nWhile openness of abstracts and citations is of critical importance,
      it\\nis of limited value if other metadata is not made openly available as\\nwell.
      This for instance includes affiliation and funding metadata,\\nlicense information,
      and links between scholarly outputs, such as links\\nbetween preprints and the
      corresponding journal articles or between\\njournal articles and the associated
      data sets. This metadata should as\\nmuch as possible make use of openly-governed
      persistent identifiers, for\\ninstance [ORCID](https://orcid.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[ROR](https://ror.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} identifiers.\\n\\nAs can
      be seen in the figure below, in recent years publishers have made\\nsignificant
      progress in making metadata of journal articles openly\\navailable through Crossref.
      More detailed statistics reported in [this\\npreprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/smxe5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      show\\nthat Wiley is doing a good job by making affiliation metadata openly\\navailable.
      Other large publishers, such as Elsevier, Springer Nature,\\nand MDPI, have
      not yet taken this step. Like many publishers, Wiley is\\nalso making funding
      metadata openly available. However, as shown in\\nrecent analyses (see\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00212){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and\\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00210){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}), for
      many\\npublishers the funding metadata made available through Crossref suffers\\nfrom
      gaps and other quality issues.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/QA-about-Wiley\u2019s-decision-to-open-its-abstracts_image1.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"29565\\\"\\nalt=\\\"rcentage

      by the European Commission (EC) to follow up on their new policy\nof Responsible
      Research and Innovation (2013). In the policy context,\nthe [concept of Responsibility
      is attributed to anticipatory, reflexive,\nresponsive, and inclusive attitudes
      in research and innovation\nprocesses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000930){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      was operationalized in six key principles: gender equality, public\nengagement,
      ethics, open access, science literacy and science education,\nand governance.
      MoRRI followed the key principles of the EC, building\nupon earlier indicators,
      and developing new ones, on a national level.\nData collection across Europe
      on the actual situation was hampered by\nthe low number of responses, and it
      was felt that such an approach\ndidn''t do justice to the diversity in policy,
      geographical and\norganisational aspects. This was all taken up by the MoRRI
      successor,\n[SUPER MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\nSUPER
      MoRRI is one of the EC flagship projects that brings together the\nEC policies
      on Responsible Research and Innovation, funded through the\nH2020 Science with
      and for Society (SwafS) program. It does so in\ndifferent ways: continuing the
      MoRRI train through a significant data\ncollection exercise, doing broad conceptual
      work through in-depth case\nstudies, and connecting with European and global
      partners. But first,\nthe [consortium]((hyperlink:%20https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}\nfelt
      that they should take the time and go back to the drawing table to\nreflect

      SUPER\u00a0MoRRI series, Wouter van der Klippe discusses the transition\nfrom
      MoRRI to the new SUPER MoRRI project. When we stop focusing on the\noutcomes
      of measurements and their accuracy and instead consider the\npossibilities that
      monitoring provides, evaluation is set free from\nproducing indicators. Instead,
      evaluation can be an opportunity to\ncreate a space for articulating what is
      valued and why. Thus,\nSUPER\u00a0MoRRI is creating a transformative opportunity
      that may better\nequip us to develop more open potential RRI-enriched futures,
      as diverse\nand inclusive as were initially hoped for.\n\n<figure style=\"float:left;

      the differences. The first policy narrative is: \"How do we\nregain control
      over the runaway train of science and technology before\nit totally destroys
      our world?\" Some hope that RRI will enable society\nto speak back to science
      and help shape research agendas and ultimately\nresearch trajectories so that
      they will lead to outputs and outcomes\nthat are beneficial to people and the
      planet. The second, opposite\nnarrative is: \"How do we educate, reassure and
      calm down the ungrateful\npublic and make them trust us, trust science again?\"
      RRI, and especially\nthe so-called RRI \"keys\" of the EC are better fit for
      the purpose of\nproviding accountability and legitimacy to calm down the citizens
      and\nargue that everything is in order. The third policy narrative sees the\nworld
      of science, technology, and society as a set of entangled networks\nthat are
      increasingly in need of mutual collaboration and communication.\nHere RRI is
      seen as a way to improve collaboration across silos and\npromote thinking outside
      of the box. Therefore, it is important to be\naware of such plurality of desires
      for RRI when working for SUPER MORRI.\n\n[In the third\nreflection](https://super-morri.eu/where-are-the-people-in-innovation-monitoring/){target=\"_blank\"},\u00a0Paula\nOtero
      Hermida describes the difference between monitoring science and\nmonitoring
      innovation. In science, there is a wide set of indicators and\nperiodic monitoring
      efforts on e.g. gender aspects. As the main\nreference, there are the [She Figures\nreports](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1){target=\"_blank\"}\n(European
      Commission) as well as indicators in the main RRI monitoring\ninitiatives at
      the European level. However, when looking at the\nmonitoring of innovation,
      it seems that the current paradigm ignores who\n(and in which conditions) innovates,
      but rather focuses on the firm''s\nenvironment and systemic variables. It is
      hence important to realise\nwhich data are *not* available: there are no data
      on the human factor in\nthe innovation surveys. That means we can find data
      regarding\ninnovation''s investment and firms, but there are\u00a0limited data
      available\non the sociodemographic traits, labor conditions, or other factors\nregarding
      the actors that are innovating themselves. Therefore, there\nare no data on
      gender in the case of the OECD, EUROSTAT nor in the\ninnovation survey carried
      out by the Spanish National Institute of\nStatistics. When data is not collected
      or available, it is important to\nbe aware of gender and other diversity aspects,
      and include it in the\nmonitoring framework to make it explicit.  \n\n### SUPER
      MoRRI''s principles\n\nWhen we do monitoring and evaluation of RRI, we would
      like ourselves to\nbe responsible too! That is reflected in the strategic plan
      that emerged\nfrom the internal conversations. Richard Woolley describes our\nprinciples
      [in the SUPER MoRRI strategic\nplan](https://super-morri.eu/the-super-morri-strategic-plan/){target=\"_blank\"}.\u00a0The\nconsortium''s
      conceptual view on RRI takes\u00a0engagement among diverse\nconstellations of
      actors as the key driver of enhanced responsibility in\nboth research and innovation
      and would increase consideration of\nrelevant environmental and societal uncertainties.
      The monitoring\nframework will provide interested stakeholders with resources
      that can\nhelp them to plan and progress toward more responsible practices and\nstrategies.
      This will be done on the basis of a ''*responsible\nquantification*'' approach
      in which data and information are presented,\nand made interpretable, in appropriate
      ways. A related conceptual\ninnovation is what we call ''*credible contextualisation''*.
      This is the\nidea that any indicators we develop should, first, pass through
      a\nco-creation phase with potential users, and second, be accompanied by\nguidance
      on the degree of interpretive ''stickiness'' of the indicator.\n\nThree years
      into the project, the two principles still stand and are\napplied [as further
      elaborated by Richard\nWoolley](https://super-morri.eu/responsible-approach-to-monitoring-rri/){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0in\na
      blogpost. Transforming these principles into a framework presenting\nSUPER MoRRI
      indicators in three components: an indicator fiche; a\ndescription of potential
      interpretive models; and complementary\ninformation to support user understanding
      and interpretation of the\nindicator. In the case of new RRI indicators, the
      interpretive model\nwill explain the rationale for the creation of the indicator
      and how it\nis perceived to support RRI. For indicators that are time-series
      -- or\nhave the potential for future replication to create time-series -- the\nmodel
      describes what a change in the indicator can be reasonably\nunderstood to mean.
      Further information is provided to try and ensure\nthe credible contextualisation
      of the indicator. Involving users in the\ndevelopment phase of the indicator
      also helps to guide the design and\nproduction of these supporting elements
      as work progresses.  \n\n### Putting the monitoring framework into practice\n\nHow
      to operationalize then the data collection in a responsible way?\nMoving away
      from surveys and analysis at the country level, instead, we\nfocus on the organisational
      level. [In a blog\npost](https://super-morri.eu/what-are-country-correspondents/){target=\"_blank\"},\u00a0Massimo\nGraae
      Losinno explains how SUPER MoRRI has engaged a [panel of Country\nCorrespondents](https://super-morri.eu/country-correspondent-network/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      monitoring activities cover all EU countries, Norway, and the UK.\nFor each
      of these 29 countries, a Country Correspondent contributed to\ndata collection
      and reporting. Country Correspondents were chosen on the\nbasis of their expertise
      in social science methods, their knowledge of\nthe national research and innovation
      system in their country of\nresidence, and their familiarity with RRI and monitoring.
      The Country\nCorrespondents are responsible for conducting interviews and document\nanalyses
      in relation to studies examining 55 Research Funding\nOrganisations (RFOs, 2
      per country) and 142 Research Performing\nOrganisations (RPOs, 4-8 per country)
      in their respective countries.\nWith this approach we build upon local knowledge
      and qualitative methods\nacross diverse political, cultural, and social settings,
      as well as\ndiverse research and innovation environments.\n\nThe substantial
      qualitative data collection effort of the Country\nCorrespondents is complemented
      by the repeated collection of secondary\ndata that were presented in MoRRI as
      well, and hence provide timeseries.\nIn [the first monitoring\nreport](https://super-morri.eu/findings/){target=\"_blank\"}\n(i.e.\u00a0D2.2),\u00a0secondary
      data on R&I expenditure, patent applications,\nlabour market participation (gender
      equality), bibliometric data on open\naccess, and Eurobarometer data are presented
      in a responsible way. The\nsecond and third monitoring reports are available
      shortly from the SUPER\nMoRRI website. Here the results of the RFO and RPO studies
      are included,\nwhich provide for the first time extensive organizational level
      data.\n\nFrom the beginning, SUPER MoRRI aimed to create impact by connecting
      to\nother funded SwafS-projects on RRI-related topics. And the wish from the\nEC
      to take a global perspective on responsibility too, has been\nimplemented through
      the\u00a0[Global Satellite\npartners](https://super-morri.eu/global-satellite-partners/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand

      on the actual situation was hampered by\\nthe low number of responses, and it

      to the new SUPER MoRRI project. When we stop focusing on the\\noutcomes of measurements
      and their accuracy and instead consider the\\npossibilities that monitoring
      provides, evaluation is set free from\\nproducing indicators. Instead, evaluation
      can be an opportunity to\\ncreate a space for articulating what is valued and

      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn 2014, CWTS got involved in the [MoRRI\\nproject](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfunded
      by the European Commission (EC) to follow up on their new policy\\nof Responsible
      Research and Innovation (2013). In the policy context,\\nthe [concept of Responsibility
      is attributed to anticipatory, reflexive,\\nresponsive, and inclusive attitudes
      in research and innovation\\nprocesses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733313000930){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      was operationalized in six key principles: gender equality, public\\nengagement,
      ethics, open access, science literacy and science education,\\nand governance.
      MoRRI followed the key principles of the EC, building\\nupon earlier indicators,
      and developing new ones, on a national level.\\nData collection across Europe
      on the actual situation was hampered by\\nthe low number of responses, and it
      was felt that such an approach\\ndidn't do justice to the diversity in policy,
      geographical and\\norganisational aspects. This was all taken up by the MoRRI
      successor,\\n[SUPER MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      \ \\n\\nSUPER MoRRI is one of the EC flagship projects that brings together
      the\\nEC policies on Responsible Research and Innovation, funded through the\\nH2020
      Science with and for Society (SwafS) program. It does so in\\ndifferent ways:
      continuing the MoRRI train through a significant data\\ncollection exercise,
      doing broad conceptual work through in-depth case\\nstudies, and connecting
      with European and global partners. But first,\\nthe [consortium]((hyperlink:%20https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nfelt
      that they should take the time and go back to the drawing table to\\nreflect
      on several aspects.  \\n\\n### Reflections on what monitoring and evaluation
      of RRI is\\n\\nIn the first\\n[blogpost](https://super-morri.eu/from-morri-to-super_morri-monitoring-as-reflection-and-learning-not-representation-and-control/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_of\\nthe
      SUPER\_MoRRI series, Wouter van der Klippe discusses the transition\\nfrom MoRRI
      to the new SUPER MoRRI project. When we stop focusing on the\\noutcomes of measurements
      and their accuracy and instead consider the\\npossibilities that monitoring
      provides, evaluation is set free from\\nproducing indicators. Instead, evaluation
      can be an opportunity to\\ncreate a space for articulating what is valued and
      why. Thus,\\nSUPER\_MoRRI is creating a transformative opportunity that may
      better\\nequip us to develop more open potential RRI-enriched futures, as diverse\\nand
      inclusive as were initially hoped for.\\n\\n<figure style=\\\"float:left; margin:60px
      40px 70px 20px;\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/supermorri_rollup.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"28808\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\nBut when we talk about monitoring RRI, is there a consensus
      on the\\npurpose or even the content of RRI?\_Roger Strand [distinguishes between\\nthree
      policy narratives for\\nRRI](https://super-morri.eu/3-policy-narratives-for-rri/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_in\\nhis
      blogpost.\_They are portrayed in a slightly caricatured way and\\nexaggerate
      the differences. The first policy narrative is: \\\"How do we\\nregain control
      over the runaway train of science and technology before\\nit totally destroys
      our world?\\\" Some hope that RRI will enable society\\nto speak back to science
      and help shape research agendas and ultimately\\nresearch trajectories so that
      they will lead to outputs and outcomes\\nthat are beneficial to people and the
      planet. The second, opposite\\nnarrative is: \\\"How do we educate, reassure
      and calm down the ungrateful\\npublic and make them trust us, trust science
      again?\\\" RRI, and especially\\nthe so-called RRI \\\"keys\\\" of the EC are
      better fit for the purpose of\\nproviding accountability and legitimacy to calm
      down the citizens and\\nargue that everything is in order. The third policy
      narrative sees the\\nworld of science, technology, and society as a set of entangled
      networks\\nthat are increasingly in need of mutual collaboration and communication.\\nHere
      RRI is seen as a way to improve collaboration across silos and\\npromote thinking
      outside of the box. Therefore, it is important to be\\naware of such plurality
      of desires for RRI when working for SUPER MORRI.\\n\\n[In the third\\nreflection](https://super-morri.eu/where-are-the-people-in-innovation-monitoring/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Paula\\nOtero
      Hermida describes the difference between monitoring science and\\nmonitoring
      innovation. In science, there is a wide set of indicators and\\nperiodic monitoring
      efforts on e.g. gender aspects. As the main\\nreference, there are the [She
      Figures\\nreports](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(European
      Commission) as well as indicators in the main RRI monitoring\\ninitiatives at
      the European level. However, when looking at the\\nmonitoring of innovation,
      it seems that the current paradigm ignores who\\n(and in which conditions) innovates,
      but rather focuses on the firm's\\nenvironment and systemic variables. It is
      hence important to realise\\nwhich data are *not* available: there are no data
      on the human factor in\\nthe innovation surveys. That means we can find data
      regarding\\ninnovation's investment and firms, but there are\_limited data available\\non
      the sociodemographic traits, labor conditions, or other factors\\nregarding
      the actors that are innovating themselves. Therefore, there\\nare no data on
      gender in the case of the OECD, EUROSTAT nor in the\\ninnovation survey carried
      out by the Spanish National Institute of\\nStatistics. When data is not collected
      or available, it is important to\\nbe aware of gender and other diversity aspects,
      and include it in the\\nmonitoring framework to make it explicit.  \\n\\n###
      SUPER MoRRI's principles\\n\\nWhen we do monitoring and evaluation of RRI, we
      would like ourselves to\\nbe responsible too! That is reflected in the strategic
      plan that emerged\\nfrom the internal conversations. Richard Woolley describes
      our\\nprinciples [in the SUPER MoRRI strategic\\nplan](https://super-morri.eu/the-super-morri-strategic-plan/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\_The\\nconsortium's
      conceptual view on RRI takes\_engagement among diverse\\nconstellations of actors
      as the key driver of enhanced responsibility in\\nboth research and innovation
      and would increase consideration of\\nrelevant environmental and societal uncertainties.
      The monitoring\\nframework will provide interested stakeholders with resources
      that can\\nhelp them to plan and progress toward more responsible practices
      and\\nstrategies. This will be done on the basis of a '*responsible\\nquantification*'
      approach in which data and information are presented,\\nand made interpretable,
      in appropriate ways. A related conceptual\\ninnovation is what we call '*credible
      contextualisation'*. This is the\\nidea that any indicators we develop should,
      first, pass through a\\nco-creation phase with potential users, and second,
      be accompanied by\\nguidance on the degree of interpretive 'stickiness' of the
      indicator.\\n\\nThree years into the project, the two principles still stand
      and are\\napplied [as further elaborated by Richard\\nWoolley](https://super-morri.eu/responsible-approach-to-monitoring-rri/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_in\\na
      blogpost. Transforming these principles into a framework presenting\\nSUPER
      MoRRI indicators in three components: an indicator fiche; a\\ndescription of
      potential interpretive models; and complementary\\ninformation to support user
      understanding and interpretation of the\\nindicator. In the case of new RRI
      indicators, the interpretive model\\nwill explain the rationale for the creation
      of the indicator and how it\\nis perceived to support RRI. For indicators that
      are time-series -- or\\nhave the potential for future replication to create
      time-series -- the\\nmodel describes what a change in the indicator can be reasonably\\nunderstood
      to mean. Further information is provided to try and ensure\\nthe credible contextualisation
      of the indicator. Involving users in the\\ndevelopment phase of the indicator
      also helps to guide the design and\\nproduction of these supporting elements
      as work progresses.  \\n\\n### Putting the monitoring framework into practice\\n\\nHow
      to operationalize then the data collection in a responsible way?\\nMoving away
      from surveys and analysis at the country level, instead, we\\nfocus on the organisational
      level. [In a blog\\npost](https://super-morri.eu/what-are-country-correspondents/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Massimo\\nGraae
      Losinno explains how SUPER MoRRI has engaged a [panel of Country\\nCorrespondents](https://super-morri.eu/country-correspondent-network/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      monitoring activities cover all EU countries, Norway, and the UK.\\nFor each
      of these 29 countries, a Country Correspondent contributed to\\ndata collection
      and reporting. Country Correspondents were chosen on the\\nbasis of their expertise
      in social science methods, their knowledge of\\nthe national research and innovation
      system in their country of\\nresidence, and their familiarity with RRI and monitoring.
      The Country\\nCorrespondents are responsible for conducting interviews and document\\nanalyses
      in relation to studies examining 55 Research Funding\\nOrganisations (RFOs,
      2 per country) and 142 Research Performing\\nOrganisations (RPOs, 4-8 per country)
      in their respective countries.\\nWith this approach we build upon local knowledge
      and qualitative methods\\nacross diverse political, cultural, and social settings,
      as well as\\ndiverse research and innovation environments.\\n\\nThe substantial
      qualitative data collection effort of the Country\\nCorrespondents is complemented
      by the repeated collection of secondary\\ndata that were presented in MoRRI
      as well, and hence provide timeseries.\\nIn [the first monitoring\\nreport](https://super-morri.eu/findings/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n(i.e.\_D2.2),\_secondary
      data on R&I expenditure, patent applications,\\nlabour market participation
      (gender equality), bibliometric data on open\\naccess, and Eurobarometer data
      are presented in a responsible way. The\\nsecond and third monitoring reports
      are available shortly from the SUPER\\nMoRRI website. Here the results of the
      RFO and RPO studies are included,\\nwhich provide for the first time extensive
      organizational level data.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, SUPER MoRRI aimed to create
      impact by connecting to\\nother funded SwafS-projects on RRI-related topics.
      And the wish from the\\nEC to take a global perspective on responsibility too,
      has been\\nimplemented through the\_[Global Satellite\\npartners](https://super-morri.eu/global-satellite-partners/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the annual events we organized. This will be described in the second\\nblog
      post on SUPER MoRRI's European ecosystem and global network.  \\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-responsibility-in-r-i\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      are currently working on the development of our [new\nknowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\na
      strategic plan for our center for the next six years. As part of this\nprocess,
      we are having lots of discussions, both internally within our\ncenter and with
      external colleagues and experts. While it will still\ntake a few more months
      before we can share the outcomes of this process,\nwe can already provide some
      impressions of the types of ideas we are\ndiscussing.\n\nOn September 15 and
      16, the CWTS team got together in a hotel in Leiden\nfor a two-day retreat.
      On the first day, we discussed the preliminary\nplans for our new knowledge
      agenda with a number of external experts,\nwho offered very useful feedback
      and helped us broaden our horizon. On\nthe second day, we challenged ourselves
      to think big and to develop\n''dream projects'' that CWTS could work on in the
      coming years. We formed\nfive groups, each consisting of five or six CWTS colleagues,
      and each\ngroup spent a few hours developing a dream project.\n\n### **Dream
      projects**\n\nOne group proposed to set up a *Global Responsible Research Assessment\nSupport
      Station* (*GRRASS*). The ambition of GRRASS is to bring together\nall stakeholders
      worldwide interested in making research assessment more\nresponsible. GRRASS
      would consist of a global network of satellite\norganizations on each continent,
      each helping to mediate between\nregional and global level activities and issues.
      Together, these sites\nwould aim to develop standards for responsible research
      assessment and\norganize accreditation in which the compliance of institutions
      with\nthese standards is evaluated.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture1.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29085\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAnother group proposed the
      *New Society-Science Collaboration*. This\nproposal builds on partnerships that
      CWTS has established in different\nparts of the world, through existing initiatives
      such as the [SUPER\nMoRRI project](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Supported by\nUnesco, the created network would be used to develop projects
      in a\nco-creative way, meaning needs-driven, with awareness of diversity and\nequality
      aspects. That would include partners that are, for instance,\ngeographically
      diverse, but also originating from all helices of the\nquadruple helix: academia,
      policy, industry and citizens. The objective\nis to expand and foster the network
      through activities. In mixed\nmethods, where the non-digital contexts prevail,
      CWTS could bring in new\ndigital methods including [diverse data sources and
      advanced mapping\napproaches](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cocreating-science-that-society-needs-introducing-the-explore-approach){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture2_2022-10-17-164357_twlc.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29056\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nA related idea was developed
      by one of the other groups. This group\nproposed to set up a *Participatory
      Activists Network*. This network\nwould focus on helping bring together activists
      who are pushing for\nchange in the science system but who are not formally involved
      in\ndecision making in scientific organizations. Contributions by CWTS would\ninitially
      be situated with specific actors in the network (e.g., around\nevaluation),
      but eventually our participation would be present across\nthe network, working
      closely with a variety of activists.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture3.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29022\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAnother dream project aimed
      to eradicate scientific misinformation from\nsocietal debates. Using a combination
      of quantitative and qualitative\nmethods, the project would systematically map
      interactions between\nscience and society. By making science-society dynamics
      visible and\ncomprehensible, the project envisions to empower academic and societal\nstakeholders
      to mitigate misinformation and renew trust in science.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture4.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"28992\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nThe final dream project is
      the *Open Comprehensive European University\nResearch Information System* (*OCEURIS*),
      an open CRIS system for all\nEuropean universities that will contain information
      deemed necessary by\nmany institutions to realize the ambition of making their
      research\nassessment processes more responsible. The aim is that in the next
      five\nyears at least half of the European universities will join OCEURIS.\n\n<figure>\n<img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture5.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"28972\" />\n</figure>\n\n**  \n**\n\n### **Employee of the
      Year Award**\n\nBesides dreaming about future projects, we also used the opportunity
      of\nbeing together at our retreat to celebrate some of the work currently\nbeing
      done at our center. Each year an *Employee of the Year Award* is\nhanded out
      to a CWTS colleague who deserves special recognition. This\nyear the award turned
      out to be a little bit different than in earlier\nyears. To acknowledge the
      importance of teamwork at CWTS, Ingeborg\nMeijer, last year''s awardee, decided
      to hand out the award not to an\nindividual colleague but to a team. The award
      was given to the\n[A-TEAM](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      performs a crucial task at CWTS by performing high-quality\ncuration of the
      data in our bibliographic database system.\nCongratulations to all members of
      the team for this well-deserved award.\nThank you for taking such good care
      of our data!\n\n### **What''s next**\n\nHave we just been dreaming at our retreat,
      or are we actually going to\nmake our dreams come true? We believe the process
      of developing dream\nprojects is valuable in itself, even if ultimately a project
      is not\ngoing to be realized. Developing dream projects stimulated us to think\nin
      less conventional ways than we normally do and to find out what we\nare truly
      passionate about. Time will tell whether we will manage to\nfind ways to make
      our dreams come true. Stay tuned for further updates\non the development of
      our new knowledge agenda!\n\n*We are grateful to our CWTS colleagues for sharing
      their dreams and\ncontributing to this blog post.*  \n", "images": [{"src":

      CWTS we are currently working on the development of our [new\nknowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/responsible-research-culture-practicing-what-we-preach-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\na
      strategic plan for our center for the next six years. As part of this\nprocess,
      we are having lots of discussions, both internally within our\ncenter and with
      external colleagues and experts. While it will still\ntake a few more months
      before we can share the outcomes of this process,\nwe can already provide some
      impressions of the types of ideas we are\ndiscussing.\n\nOn September 15 and
      16, the CWTS team got together in a hotel in Leiden\nfor a two-day retreat.
      On the first day, we discussed the preliminary\nplans for our new knowledge
      agenda with a number of external experts,\nwho offered very useful feedback
      and helped us broaden our horizon. On\nthe second day, we challenged ourselves
      to think big and to develop\n''dream projects'' that CWTS could work on in the
      coming years. We formed\nfive groups, each consisting of five or six CWTS colleagues,
      and each\ngroup spent a few hours developing a dream project.\n\n### **Dream
      projects**\n\nOne group proposed to set up a *Global Responsible Research Assessment\nSupport
      Station* (*GRRASS*). The ambition of GRRASS is to bring together\nall stakeholders
      worldwide interested in making research assessment more\nresponsible. GRRASS
      would consist of a global network of satellite\norganizations on each continent,
      each helping to mediate between\nregional and global level activities and issues.
      Together, these sites\nwould aim to develop standards for responsible research
      assessment and\norganize accreditation in which the compliance of institutions
      with\nthese standards is evaluated.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture1.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29085\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAnother group proposed the
      *New Society-Science Collaboration*. This\nproposal builds on partnerships that
      CWTS has established in different\nparts of the world, through existing initiatives
      such as the [SUPER\nMoRRI project](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Supported by\nUnesco, the created network would be used to develop projects
      in a\nco-creative way, meaning needs-driven, with awareness of diversity and\nequality
      aspects. That would include partners that are, for instance,\ngeographically
      diverse, but also originating from all helices of the\nquadruple helix: academia,
      policy, industry and citizens. The objective\nis to expand and foster the network
      through activities. In mixed\nmethods, where the non-digital contexts prevail,
      CWTS could bring in new\ndigital methods including [diverse data sources and
      advanced mapping\napproaches](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cocreating-science-that-society-needs-introducing-the-explore-approach){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture2_2022-10-17-164357_twlc.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29056\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nA related idea was developed
      by one of the other groups. This group\nproposed to set up a *Participatory
      Activists Network*. This network\nwould focus on helping bring together activists
      who are pushing for\nchange in the science system but who are not formally involved
      in\ndecision making in scientific organizations. Contributions by CWTS would\ninitially
      be situated with specific actors in the network (e.g., around\nevaluation),
      but eventually our participation would be present across\nthe network, working
      closely with a variety of activists.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture3.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"29022\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nAnother dream project aimed
      to eradicate scientific misinformation from\nsocietal debates. Using a combination
      of quantitative and qualitative\nmethods, the project would systematically map
      interactions between\nscience and society. By making science-society dynamics
      visible and\ncomprehensible, the project envisions to empower academic and societal\nstakeholders
      to mitigate misinformation and renew trust in science.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture4.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"28992\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nThe final dream project is
      the *Open Comprehensive European University\nResearch Information System* (*OCEURIS*),
      an open CRIS system for all\nEuropean universities that will contain information
      deemed necessary by\nmany institutions to realize the ambition of making their
      research\nassessment processes more responsible. The aim is that in the next
      five\nyears at least half of the European universities will join OCEURIS.\n\n<figure>\n<img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Picture5.jpg\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"28972\" />\n</figure>\n\n**  \n**\n\n### **Employee of the
      Year Award**\n\nBesides dreaming about future projects, we also used the opportunity
      of\nbeing together at our retreat to celebrate some of the work currently\nbeing
      done at our center. Each year an *Employee of the Year Award* is\nhanded out
      to a CWTS colleague who deserves special recognition. This\nyear the award turned
      out to be a little bit different than in earlier\nyears. To acknowledge the
      importance of teamwork at CWTS, Ingeborg\nMeijer, last year''s awardee, decided
      to hand out the award not to an\nindividual colleague but to a team. The award
      was given to the\n[A-TEAM](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/a-team-a-stands-for-very-challenging-job){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      performs a crucial task at CWTS by performing high-quality\ncuration of the
      data in our bibliographic database system.\nCongratulations to all members of
      the team for this well-deserved award.\nThank you for taking such good care
      of our data!\n\n### **What''s next**\n\nHave we just been dreaming at our retreat,
      or are we actually going to\nmake our dreams come true? We believe the process
      of developing dream\nprojects is valuable in itself, even if ultimately a project
      is not\ngoing to be realized. Developing dream projects stimulated us to think\nin
      less conventional ways than we normally do and to find out what we\nare truly
      passionate about. Time will tell whether we will manage to\nfind ways to make
      our dreams come true. Stay tuned for further updates\non the development of
      our new knowledge agenda!\n\n*We are grateful to our CWTS colleagues for sharing
      their dreams and\ncontributing to this blog post.*  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      involvement of all kinds of local stakeholders and\ncitizens. This blogpost
      follows up on the first [RIPEET CHERRIES\nblogpost](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cherries-and-ripeet-cwts-traveling-the-science-society-interface?token=ew9UXNynLGIZAFaGNw53I96lA0f3qKPm){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      explains what these projects are about and what CWTS has learned\nfrom working
      at the science-society interface.  \n\n### RRI & SMART Specialisation {#rri-smart-specialisation}\n\nThe
      core concept in both projects is\n[RRI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346632810_Monitoring_Responsible_Research_and_Innovation_in_the_European_research_area){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThis
      policy approach anticipates and assesses potential implications and\nsocietal
      expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the\naim to foster
      the design of inclusive and sustainable research and\ninnovation. It implies
      that societal actors (researchers, citizens,\npolicy makers, business, third
      sector organisations, etc.) work together\nduring the whole research and innovation
      process in order to better\nalign both the process and its outcomes with the
      values, needs and\nexpectations of society. In practice, RRI is implemented
      as a package\nthat includes multi-actor and [public engagement in research and\ninnovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/node/766){target=\"_blank\"}.\nRRI
      thus enables easier access to scientific results, the take up of\ngender equality
      and ethics in the research and innovation content and\nprocesses, and formal
      and informal science education. RRI actions such\nas fostering co-creation and
      demand driven R&I in an open and\nresponsible way can be a complex matter due
      to the plurality of actors\ninvolved and the socio-cultural divergences between
      the different\ngeographical areas in Europe. However, it can also be a great\nopportunity
      for growth if it is done effectively. However, neither the\ntheory, policy nor
      practice of RRI pays attention to the spatial\ndimension of research and innovation
      processes. As a consequence, RRI\npractices often ignore the various ways in
      which regional context\naffects not only the development of innovation but also
      the perception\nof what is responsible and socially desirable.\n\n''[Smart\nSpecialisation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\"_blank\"}''\nis
      an innovation policy concept intended to promote the efficient and\neffective
      use of public investment in research. Its goal is to boost\nregional (territorial)
      science and innovation in order to achieve\neconomic growth and prosperity,
      by enabling regions to pursue new\ndevelopments by making use of their local
      strengths. It has been gaining\nimportance for innovation policy because of
      the role of proximity and\nthe presence of knowledge-related institutions in
      associated fields are\nthought to have a positive influence. Thereby, the smart
      specialisation\nstrategy\n([RIS3](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home){target=\"_blank\"})\nprogramme
      is the most ambitious and endowed approach of EU-funded\nterritorial innovation
      policies so far. However, the potential\nimplications and societal expectations
      with regard to research and\ninnovation have often been ignored in the smart
      specialisation discourse\nand the entrepreneurial development process that should
      support S3.\n\nThe European Commission recently launched the new smart specialisation\npolicy
      framework; S4. S4 specifically focuses on sustainable innovation,\nwhich aims
      at demand driven social innovation that should bring long\nlasting systemic
      changes and green innovation to the European regions.\nThis requires not only
      a well-designed priority portfolio tailored to\nthe region, but also active
      participation from regional actors and a\nregional learning process. The concept
      of regional participation,\nexperimentation and initiatives to achieve desired
      social transformative\nchange originates from the third frame of innovation
      policy, regarded in\nliterature as the most recent paradigm in which to view
      innovation\npolicy (distinguished from two earlier framings related to R&D and\nnational
      systems of innovation). These social transformations that S4\ntargets are often
      very complex with many stakeholders involved, take\nplace on different levels
      of society and are of systemic nature.\nTherefore, S4 calls for a directional
      systemic approach in which a\ndiverse set of local actors determine the directions
      to take\ncollectively. To support regions in this process, methodologies, tools\nand
      workshop formats have to be developed to guide regions in for\ninstance stakeholder
      engagement, regional mapping, target setting,\nworking backwards from goals,
      and reflection and evaluation. The\nEuropean Commission is working on the S4
      Playbook in which these type of\napproaches are collected to assist the regions
      here. Although a helpful\nsupport, regions will likely differ a lot in their
      nature, needs and\nquestions, which means that often a case to case assessment
      is required.\n\n### RRI X SMART SPEC (S4)\n\nIt is especially in S4 that smart
      specialisation and RRI can be well\naligned, given that both concepts address
      demand driven, social and\ninclusive developments in a participatory process
      involving regional\nactors. Combining the two concepts has the potential to
      better align\nresearch with local societal demands and to bring new research
      insights\nto society more effectively. This combination is a new one that\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}
      has implemented in both\n[CHERRIES](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/cherries){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[RIPEET](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/ripeet){target=\"_blank\"}\nby
      conducting a mixed method approach. On the one hand regional data was\ncollected
      on scientific output, technological development, actors and\npolicy programs.
      On the other hand regional discussion groups were\norganised in which all types
      of regional actors could voice their\ninnovation needs and ideas as well as
      comment upon the collected\nregional data. This was very much an iterative process
      in which we went\nback and forth between the data and regional actors multiple
      time.\nNevertheless, in the end we ended up with a comprehensive overview of\nthe
      regional innovation ecosystem of which the data was screened by\nregional actors
      and in which the societal needs voiced by the regional\nactors could be evaluated
      by the regional data.\n\n### Expertise at\u00a0CWTS\n\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      very well positioned to conduct this type of analysis, as it had\nexpertise
      in multiple related areas. In the first place CWTS is a mixed\nmethod institute
      with both quantitative and qualitative expertise, which\nfits this type of analysis
      well. It also has been involved in many\nrelated projects focusing on topics
      like the sustainable development\ngoals\n([STRINGS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/strings){target=\"_blank\"}),\nparticipatory
      processes (Knowledge Ecosystems), scientific and\ntechnological data analysis\n([RISIS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/risis){target=\"_blank\"}),\ninnovation
      dynamics ([H2020\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/newhorrizon){target=\"_blank\"})\nand
      development of a monitoring framework for responsible R&I practices\n([SUPER\nMoRRI](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/supermorri){target=\"_blank\"}).\nAn
      approach that combines these elements enables CWTS to put its\nknowledge and
      expertise in practice and support transitions that benefit\nsociety. Moreover,
      participating in such projects helps to align the\nresearch conducted at the
      institute with present-day questions that\narise in societal, scientific and
      policy communities.\n\n### EXPLORE\n\nIn order to facilitate local knowledge
      production and experimentation\nthat help regions to create more sustainable
      and inclusive societies,\nCWTS recently launched the EXPLORE (EX(ploring) P(articipatory)
      L(ocal)\nO(pen) responsible R(&I) E(cosystems) methodology. As the acronym\nsuggests,
      it combines the fundamental building blocks of RRI and S4 into\nan accessible
      R&I approach. We do this by integrating heterogeneous\nelements like group workshops,
      process evaluation and territorial\nmapping under the same methodological umbrella
      in a modular format. This\nmodular format enables us to select the specific
      elements that a given\nterritorial societal demand requires, thus making the
      approach very\nflexible to any kind of territory or challenge. Moreover, this
      approach\nhelps to avoid the \"one policy fits all\" pitfall by enabling a bottom-up\napproach
      and taking the region specific situation as the starting point\nof each assessment.
      The EXPLORE methodology enables CWTS to be more\ninvolved in local and regional
      experimentation and innovation, the\nco-creation of new priority targets and
      policy mixes, the [monitoring\nand evaluation](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\"_blank\"}
      of\nthese processes, and social transformative change in general.\n\n### What
      includes EXPLORE\n\nThe modular building blocks in EXPLORE can be stored under
      three main\nimportant innovation processes: Mapping, priority setting & [transition\nprocess](https://repository.fteval.at/603/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nmonitoring & evaluation (M&E).\n\nFirstly, EXPLORE can help territories
      to get an overview of their R&I\nlandscape by offering different **mapping**
      analyses. This is an\nimportant understanding for governments and societal actors
      alike,\nbecause it provides the basis from which new plans, strategies,\nexperiments
      and innovation in general can be developed. Among these\nanalyses are for instance
      stakeholder discussion sessions that identify\nbarriers and opportunities in
      the R&I system together with the local\nactors. Also the policy landscape can
      be analysed to identify what\nopportunities for experimentation already exist
      and where gaps may be\nfound that should be addressed. Lastly, EXPLORE also
      offers extensive\ndata analysis of the regional knowledge landscape based on
      publication\nand patent output with visualisations that show in a glance where
      the\nrelative capabilities of the territory are located in a given innovation\nfield.
      One such approach is the Science Landscape, as shown below for\nthe energy field
      in Extremadura.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Extremadura-energy-map-720.png\"\ndata-image=\"28368\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nSecondly, EXPLORE can also assist in **priority setting**
      and in the\n**transition process** itself. The included tools help government
      and\nlocal actors to make difficult choices, approach complex challenges\noutside
      their usual scope and initiate experimentation. It can provide\nhints for prioritisation
      compliant to the smart specialisation rationale\nbased on local knowledge data
      analysis that should then be combined with\nlocal actor input. It provides further
      assistance tools by a wide\nvariety of workshop options to get closer to the
      desired priorities and\noutcomes. Among these are for instance workshops that
      structure the\nlocal needs present, visioning workshops that constitute a vision
      of\nwhat could be achieved and backcasting exercises that work out how to\nget
      to a desired future. In all these workshops participants are\nchallenged to
      keep an open mind, local actors are heavily involved and\nexercises are flexible
      to adhere to the local context.\n\n<figure style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/20220914_1_Picture2.png\"\ndata-image=\"27342\"\nalt=\"CHERRIES
      Policy Labs session in Brussels (May 2022)\" />\n</figure>\n\n[*CHERRIES Policy
      Labs session in Brussels (May 2022)  \n*]{.caption}\n\nLastly, EXPLORE can assist
      in the **monitoring and evaluation** of\nongoing prioritisation and experimentation.
      Monitoring and evaluation is\ncrucial in every innovation process, as it checks
      whether the process is\non track to reach its desired goals, participating actors
      are still on\nthe same page and makes sure that the right changes can be made
      on the\nfly in a dynamic process. EXPLORE includes a wide spectrum of activities\nthat
      can be deployed in this regard. These range from short and frequent\nlike monitoring
      discussions or expert and stakeholder interviews to more\nintensive like on-site
      monitoring visits and impact workshops. M&E is\nguided by evaluative conversations
      rather than following up a set of\nindicators. The impact workshops can be general,
      but can also be more\nspecific on a certain aspect where impact is challenging
      or highly\ndesired to reach more specific feedback and results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn
      a nutshell, with EXPLORE CWTS wishes to make the valuable insights of\nS4 and
      RRI more accessible and easier to apply in a practical context.\nThis will give
      territories a stronger basis to develop successful and\nsustainable initiatives
      that serve society. Combined with a\nparticipatory transition process this has
      the potential to open more\nopportunity for experimentation and social initiatives.
      Hopefully, this\nwill accelerate the transformation that all territories in
      Europe\ndesperately strive for while strengthening local interests.  \n", "images":

      explains what these projects are about and what CWTS has learned\\nfrom working
      at the science-society interface.  \\n\\n### RRI & SMART Specialisation {#rri-smart-specialisation}\\n\\nThe
      core concept in both projects is\\n[RRI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346632810_Monitoring_Responsible_Research_and_Innovation_in_the_European_research_area){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThis
      policy approach anticipates and assesses potential implications and\\nsocietal
      expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the\\naim to foster
      the design of inclusive and sustainable research and\\ninnovation. It implies
      that societal actors (researchers, citizens,\\npolicy makers, business, third
      sector organisations, etc.) work together\\nduring the whole research and innovation
      process in order to better\\nalign both the process and its outcomes with the
      values, needs and\\nexpectations of society. In practice, RRI is implemented
      as a package\\nthat includes multi-actor and [public engagement in research
      and\\ninnovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/node/766){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nRRI
      thus enables easier access to scientific results, the take up of\\ngender equality
      and ethics in the research and innovation content and\\nprocesses, and formal
      and informal science education. RRI actions such\\nas fostering co-creation
      and demand driven R&I in an open and\\nresponsible way can be a complex matter
      due to the plurality of actors\\ninvolved and the socio-cultural divergences
      between the different\\ngeographical areas in Europe. However, it can also be
      a great\\nopportunity for growth if it is done effectively. However, neither
      the\\ntheory, policy nor practice of RRI pays attention to the spatial\\ndimension
      of research and innovation processes. As a consequence, RRI\\npractices often
      ignore the various ways in which regional context\\naffects not only the development
      of innovation but also the perception\\nof what is responsible and socially
      desirable.\\n\\n'[Smart\\nSpecialisation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}'\\nis
      an innovation policy concept intended to promote the efficient and\\neffective
      use of public investment in research. Its goal is to boost\\nregional (territorial)
      science and innovation in order to achieve\\neconomic growth and prosperity,
      by enabling regions to pursue new\\ndevelopments by making use of their local
      strengths. It has been gaining\\nimportance for innovation policy because of
      the role of proximity and\\nthe presence of knowledge-related institutions in
      associated fields are\\nthought to have a positive influence. Thereby, the smart
      specialisation\\nstrategy\\n([RIS3](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nprogramme
      is the most ambitious and endowed approach of EU-funded\\nterritorial innovation
      policies so far. However, the potential\\nimplications and societal expectations
      with regard to research and\\ninnovation have often been ignored in the smart
      specialisation discourse\\nand the entrepreneurial development process that
      should support S3.\\n\\nThe European Commission recently launched the new smart
      specialisation\\npolicy framework; S4. S4 specifically focuses on sustainable
      innovation,\\nwhich aims at demand driven social innovation that should bring
      long\\nlasting systemic changes and green innovation to the European regions.\\nThis
      requires not only a well-designed priority portfolio tailored to\\nthe region,
      but also active participation from regional actors and a\\nregional learning
      process. The concept of regional participation,\\nexperimentation and initiatives
      to achieve desired social transformative\\nchange originates from the third
      frame of innovation policy, regarded in\\nliterature as the most recent paradigm
      in which to view innovation\\npolicy (distinguished from two earlier framings
      related to R&D and\\nnational systems of innovation). These social transformations
      that S4\\ntargets are often very complex with many stakeholders involved, take\\nplace
      on different levels of society and are of systemic nature.\\nTherefore, S4 calls
      for a directional systemic approach in which a\\ndiverse set of local actors
      determine the directions to take\\ncollectively. To support regions in this
      process, methodologies, tools\\nand workshop formats have to be developed to
      guide regions in for\\ninstance stakeholder engagement, regional mapping, target
      setting,\\nworking backwards from goals, and reflection and evaluation. The\\nEuropean
      Commission is working on the S4 Playbook in which these type of\\napproaches
      are collected to assist the regions here. Although a helpful\\nsupport, regions
      will likely differ a lot in their nature, needs and\\nquestions, which means
      that often a case to case assessment is required.\\n\\n### RRI X SMART SPEC
      (S4)\\n\\nIt is especially in S4 that smart specialisation and RRI can be well\\naligned,
      given that both concepts address demand driven, social and\\ninclusive developments
      in a participatory process involving regional\\nactors. Combining the two concepts
      has the potential to better align\\nresearch with local societal demands and
      to bring new research insights\\nto society more effectively. This combination
      is a new one that\\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} has
      implemented in both\\n[CHERRIES](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/cherries){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand\\n[RIPEET](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/ripeet){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nby
      conducting a mixed method approach. On the one hand regional data was\\ncollected
      on scientific output, technological development, actors and\\npolicy programs.
      On the other hand regional discussion groups were\\norganised in which all types
      of regional actors could voice their\\ninnovation needs and ideas as well as
      comment upon the collected\\nregional data. This was very much an iterative
      process in which we went\\nback and forth between the data and regional actors
      multiple time.\\nNevertheless, in the end we ended up with a comprehensive overview
      of\\nthe regional innovation ecosystem of which the data was screened by\\nregional
      actors and in which the societal needs voiced by the regional\\nactors could
      be evaluated by the regional data.\\n\\n### Expertise at\_CWTS\\n\\n[CWTS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      very well positioned to conduct this type of analysis, as it had\\nexpertise
      in multiple related areas. In the first place CWTS is a mixed\\nmethod institute
      with both quantitative and qualitative expertise, which\\nfits this type of
      analysis well. It also has been involved in many\\nrelated projects focusing
      on topics like the sustainable development\\ngoals\\n([STRINGS](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/past-projects/strings){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}),\\nparticipatory

      researchers and inventors are explorers --\u00a0boldly going where\nno one has
      gone before. Most people agree on this. However, the\nrelevance of their discoveries
      or breakthroughs is perceived very\ndifferently by different groups, at least
      when it comes down to\ntechnology transfer of that invention from universities
      to companies. Is\nthe discovery the work of the singular individual, the spark
      of genius\nand deep matter expertise that shed light on what would have otherwise\nremained
      in darkness -- the ''Einstein'' type of explorer? Or is the\ndiscovery like
      making landfall on a distant shore, a shore that this\njust a small part of
      potentially an entire continent, the exploration of\nwhich will require effort
      and time by many -- the ''Columbus'' type?\n\n### The four I''s\n\nIn university
      technology transfer settings, the key interactions and\npatent licensing negotiations
      between the university and company usually\nevolve around the patented *invention*.
      The university researcher works\nfrom *idea* to invention and company R&D departments
      pick up the\ninvention and turn it into *innovation*. This invention, often
      laid down\nin a patent application, is a central element of the transfer. Although\nthe
      patent is arguably often the capstone for the know-how and\ncommitment of the
      inventors, it plays a central role in university\ntechnology transfer. Granting
      a company access to such an invention,\nthrough a license or some other arrangement,
      is one of the defining\ntransactions in technology transfer and often a bone
      of contention for\nmany involved, researchers, technology transfer managers,
      entrepreneurs,\nand *investors*.\n\nThese people, usually overseen by the respective
      executive management\nlayers, are the negotiation parties that have to strike
      the arrangements\nthat result in the intended transfer. That is not always a
      smooth and\nstraightforward process: their different backgrounds and goals lead
      to\nasymmetric information distribution, misunderstandings, and friction.\nEven
      the corporate R&D staff are prone to this, as the context in which\nthey operate
      is very different from academic research environments. The\ndifference is not
      the science underlying all their work but the\nprocesses, aims and structures
      of the organizations that drive and aim\ntheir work. The researcher''s place
      in their respective organizations,\nand their R&D objectives, sets them apart
      when it comes to role, goal\nand responsibility within the tech transfer negotiation
      processes.\n\nSuch fundamental differences in perspectives between universities
      and\ncompanies are not always fully recognized, which also play out at the\nnegotiation
      table. Take for example terminology. Although the term ''R&D''\nis used by both
      sides to describe their work, the actual activities will\ndiffer markedly. Moreover,
      a lot of university researchers will claim\nthey are ''innovating'' but their
      use of this catch-all term refers to\n''newness'' in general, rather the more
      apt definition of an innovation in\neconomic settings and the business sector:
      producing a ''new or improved\nproduct or process for the marketplace''. In
      other words, innovations are\nproduced by industry and it is the company that
      creates significant\neconomic value -- not the university.\n\n### Three more
      I''s\n\nTo better understand the complexity of university technology transfer
      it\nis important to understand the ''human factor'' dimension, especially the\nrole
      of the university researcher who has made the invention. Most\nresearchers or
      professors at a university lack extensive direct\nexperience with industry R&D
      or business practices. Similarly, the\ncolleagues of the company researchers
      are usually not very familiar with\nthe culture and processes at a university
      and struggle to understand the\nuniversity and its peculiar ways.\n\nThis university
      researcher, the Einstein, not only came up with the idea\nbut also contributes
      in-depth expertise on the topic and access to a\nnetwork of other experts. Especially
      in the case of a first patent\napplication, and the tentative nature of the
      new invention, the company\nwants her to be part of their corporate R&D process.
      Such inventors may\nnot see themselves as subordinates to university management
      and\ntransfers of researchers (and their grant funding) is common; their\ninterests
      and perspective may not align with the university''s\nperspective. However,
      the university owns the right to the invention,\nmaking them an inseparable
      part of any tech transfer arrangement with\nthe company.\n\nConsequently, ''I,
      the researcher'', ''I, the university'' and ''I, the\ncompany'', often have
      to enter into what amounts to a trilateral\nrelationship within license negotiation
      positions.\n\n### It takes two to tango, but three can be a crowd\n\nResearch
      shows that these three groups tend to have strong opinions of\neach other, owing
      to their different perspectives, objectives and\ninterests. Where the university
      and technology transfer managers see\nthemselves as brokers, the researchers
      lament their lack of technical\nexpertise, while the companies complain about
      the lack of market acumen.\nThe researchers consider their invention the crucial
      link to new,\ninnovative products, while the company sees one of multiple routes
      to a\nnew product, and the university sees a publicly funded asset to be\nexploited.
      Managing the financially risky development process by the\ncompany is perceived
      by entrepreneurs and investors as a complex step\ntowards innovation, while
      the researcher sees a straightforward path\nfrom ''invention to innovation'',
      and the university may want to avoid a\nPR risk in being seen as perhaps too
      involved in commercial activities\nrather than its two core institutional missions
      (education and\nresearch). The organization''s structure and culture impact
      the\nperception of management and authority. Large organizations, be it\ncorporates
      or universities, operate on different speeds compared to\neager startup companies
      and enterprising individual professors.\n\nAll of this leads to different views
      between the three ''I''s'' engaged in\nthe negotiations on tech transfer rewards
      and risks. The difference\nbetween ''Einstein'' and ''Columbus'' is the negotiated
      compensation. The\nformer is an individual of unique creativity, the latter
      is a team\nplayer who reached his goal because through perseverance that. The
      value\nof a unique idea versus the first step of a long and winding road is\ndifferent.
      The role and importance of university technology transfer for\nall of the ''I''s'',
      from the professor''s idea and the company''s innovation\nis an important value-creating
      trajectory; for the university it is\nperceived to be a tertiary function at
      best and one that comes with PR\nrisks. Think of, for example, a professor suddenly
      the proud owner of an\nexpensive car paid for by income generated from university
      technology\ntransfer.\n\nWhile one can lament the university''s risk-averse
      culture and the\nfriction it may create for university technology transfer,
      the\nchallenge-driven academic research culture also fosters creativity,\nindependent
      thought and critical thinking\u00a0-- traits that are highly\nvalued in Western
      society and values that universities are expected to\nteach their students.
      Students who may also find employment in those\nsame innovative companies. The
      duality of culture that makes it\ndifficult to cross the ''public/private''
      divide and collaborate with\ncompanies in the private sector, but also worthwhile
      in terms of\neconomic gains and societal benefits. Of course many sensible people\nrecognize
      that finding a middle ground is necessary and crucial. As Lita\nNelsen, the
      former Director of the MIT Technology Licensing Office,\nnoted on the nature
      of tech transfer: \"It''s not a business, but run it\nlike a business\".\n\n###
      The I in information gap\n\nBut what does that mean; to run it like a business?
      To make university\ntechnology transfer processes more efficient and effective,
      it is\nimportant to move beyond generalized opinions and misperceptions.\nPractice
      does not make perfect, but accumulating experience in tech\ntransfer offers
      guidelines and creates valuable expertise for\npractitioners. But to really
      improve university technology transfer,\nsome issues need to be made more explicit
      and information gaps need to\nbe filled in order to have the I''s come together.\n\nCrucially,
      it is important to move beyond the general understandings of\ntechnology transfer
      negotiation processes into the nitty-gritty\nspecifics of those interactions.
      Detailed analyses may generate new\ninsights that can not only benefit new entrants
      in tech transfer, but\nalso inform experienced practitioners on both sides of
      the fence -- both\ncompanies and universities. This is the topic of ongoing
      research which\ntakes individual cases as a starting point. Looking into the
      perspective\nof all the ''I''s'' of a patent licensing negotiation. It aims
      to identify\nthe intentions, perceptions and the information gap between the
      various\nnegotiating parties and their stakeholders. To test hypotheses based
      on\nthose case studies a survey has been designed which will be distributed\nin
      October among interested parties through a variety of networks.\n\n*This blog

      I' for invention\\n\\nAcademic researchers and inventors are explorers --\_boldly
      going where\\nno one has gone before. Most people agree on this. However, the\\nrelevance
      of their discoveries or breakthroughs is perceived very\\ndifferently by different
      groups, at least when it comes down to\\ntechnology transfer of that invention
      from universities to companies. Is\\nthe discovery the work of the singular
      individual, the spark of genius\\nand deep matter expertise that shed light
      on what would have otherwise\\nremained in darkness -- the 'Einstein' type of
      explorer? Or is the\\ndiscovery like making landfall on a distant shore, a shore
      that this\\njust a small part of potentially an entire continent, the exploration
      of\\nwhich will require effort and time by many -- the 'Columbus' type?\\n\\n###
      The four I's\\n\\nIn university technology transfer settings, the key interactions
      and\\npatent licensing negotiations between the university and company usually\\nevolve
      around the patented *invention*. The university researcher works\\nfrom *idea*
      to invention and company R&D departments pick up the\\ninvention and turn it
      into *innovation*. This invention, often laid down\\nin a patent application,
      is a central element of the transfer. Although\\nthe patent is arguably often
      the capstone for the know-how and\\ncommitment of the inventors, it plays a
      central role in university\\ntechnology transfer. Granting a company access
      to such an invention,\\nthrough a license or some other arrangement, is one
      of the defining\\ntransactions in technology transfer and often a bone of contention
      for\\nmany involved, researchers, technology transfer managers, entrepreneurs,\\nand
      *investors*.\\n\\nThese people, usually overseen by the respective executive
      management\\nlayers, are the negotiation parties that have to strike the arrangements\\nthat
      result in the intended transfer. That is not always a smooth and\\nstraightforward
      process: their different backgrounds and goals lead to\\nasymmetric information
      distribution, misunderstandings, and friction.\\nEven the corporate R&D staff
      are prone to this, as the context in which\\nthey operate is very different
      from academic research environments. The\\ndifference is not the science underlying
      all their work but the\\nprocesses, aims and structures of the organizations
      that drive and aim\\ntheir work. The researcher's place in their respective
      organizations,\\nand their R&D objectives, sets them apart when it comes to
      role, goal\\nand responsibility within the tech transfer negotiation processes.\\n\\nSuch
      fundamental differences in perspectives between universities and\\ncompanies
      are not always fully recognized, which also play out at the\\nnegotiation table.
      Take for example terminology. Although the term 'R&D'\\nis used by both sides
      to describe their work, the actual activities will\\ndiffer markedly. Moreover,
      a lot of university researchers will claim\\nthey are 'innovating' but their
      use of this catch-all term refers to\\n'newness' in general, rather the more
      apt definition of an innovation in\\neconomic settings and the business sector:
      producing a 'new or improved\\nproduct or process for the marketplace'. In other
      words, innovations are\\nproduced by industry and it is the company that creates
      significant\\neconomic value -- not the university.\\n\\n### Three more I's\\n\\nTo
      better understand the complexity of university technology transfer it\\nis important
      to understand the 'human factor' dimension, especially the\\nrole of the university
      researcher who has made the invention. Most\\nresearchers or professors at a
      university lack extensive direct\\nexperience with industry R&D or business
      practices. Similarly, the\\ncolleagues of the company researchers are usually
      not very familiar with\\nthe culture and processes at a university and struggle
      to understand the\\nuniversity and its peculiar ways.\\n\\nThis university researcher,
      the Einstein, not only came up with the idea\\nbut also contributes in-depth
      expertise on the topic and access to a\\nnetwork of other experts. Especially
      in the case of a first patent\\napplication, and the tentative nature of the
      new invention, the company\\nwants her to be part of their corporate R&D process.
      Such inventors may\\nnot see themselves as subordinates to university management
      and\\ntransfers of researchers (and their grant funding) is common; their\\ninterests
      and perspective may not align with the university's\\nperspective. However,
      the university owns the right to the invention,\\nmaking them an inseparable
      part of any tech transfer arrangement with\\nthe company.\\n\\nConsequently,
      'I, the researcher', 'I, the university' and 'I, the\\ncompany', often have
      to enter into what amounts to a trilateral\\nrelationship within license negotiation
      positions.\\n\\n### It takes two to tango, but three can be a crowd\\n\\nResearch
      shows that these three groups tend to have strong opinions of\\neach other,
      owing to their different perspectives, objectives and\\ninterests. Where the
      university and technology transfer managers see\\nthemselves as brokers, the
      researchers lament their lack of technical\\nexpertise, while the companies
      complain about the lack of market acumen.\\nThe researchers consider their invention
      the crucial link to new,\\ninnovative products, while the company sees one of
      multiple routes to a\\nnew product, and the university sees a publicly funded
      asset to be\\nexploited. Managing the financially risky development process
      by the\\ncompany is perceived by entrepreneurs and investors as a complex step\\ntowards
      innovation, while the researcher sees a straightforward path\\nfrom 'invention
      to innovation', and the university may want to avoid a\\nPR risk in being seen
      as perhaps too involved in commercial activities\\nrather than its two core
      institutional missions (education and\\nresearch). The organization's structure
      and culture impact the\\nperception of management and authority. Large organizations,
      be it\\ncorporates or universities, operate on different speeds compared to\\neager
      startup companies and enterprising individual professors.\\n\\nAll of this leads
      to different views between the three 'I's' engaged in\\nthe negotiations on
      tech transfer rewards and risks. The difference\\nbetween 'Einstein' and 'Columbus'
      is the negotiated compensation. The\\nformer is an individual of unique creativity,
      the latter is a team\\nplayer who reached his goal because through perseverance
      that. The value\\nof a unique idea versus the first step of a long and winding
      road is\\ndifferent. The role and importance of university technology transfer
      for\\nall of the 'I's', from the professor's idea and the company's innovation\\nis
      an important value-creating trajectory; for the university it is\\nperceived
      to be a tertiary function at best and one that comes with PR\\nrisks. Think
      of, for example, a professor suddenly the proud owner of an\\nexpensive car
      paid for by income generated from university technology\\ntransfer.\\n\\nWhile
      one can lament the university's risk-averse culture and the\\nfriction it may
      create for university technology transfer, the\\nchallenge-driven academic research
      culture also fosters creativity,\\nindependent thought and critical thinking\_--
      traits that are highly\\nvalued in Western society and values that universities
      are expected to\\nteach their students. Students who may also find employment
      in those\\nsame innovative companies. The duality of culture that makes it\\ndifficult
      to cross the 'public/private' divide and collaborate with\\ncompanies in the
      private sector, but also worthwhile in terms of\\neconomic gains and societal
      benefits. Of course many sensible people\\nrecognize that finding a middle ground
      is necessary and crucial. As Lita\\nNelsen, the former Director of the MIT Technology
      Licensing Office,\\nnoted on the nature of tech transfer: \\\"It's not a business,
      but run it\\nlike a business\\\".\\n\\n### The I in information gap\\n\\nBut
      what does that mean; to run it like a business? To make university\\ntechnology
      transfer processes more efficient and effective, it is\\nimportant to move beyond
      generalized opinions and misperceptions.\\nPractice does not make perfect, but
      accumulating experience in tech\\ntransfer offers guidelines and creates valuable
      expertise for\\npractitioners. But to really improve university technology transfer,\\nsome
      issues need to be made more explicit and information gaps need to\\nbe filled
      in order to have the I's come together.\\n\\nCrucially, it is important to move
      beyond the general understandings of\\ntechnology transfer negotiation processes
      into the nitty-gritty\\nspecifics of those interactions. Detailed analyses may
      generate new\\ninsights that can not only benefit new entrants in tech transfer,
      but\\nalso inform experienced practitioners on both sides of the fence -- both\\ncompanies
      and universities. This is the topic of ongoing research which\\ntakes individual
      cases as a starting point. Looking into the perspective\\nof all the 'I's' of
      a patent licensing negotiation. It aims to identify\\nthe intentions, perceptions
      and the information gap between the various\\nnegotiating parties and their
      stakeholders. To test hypotheses based on\\nthose case studies a survey has
      been designed which will be distributed\\nin October among interested parties
      through a variety of networks.\\n\\n*This blog post is part of my ongoing PhD
      study at CWTS, which is\\nsupervised by Prof. Robert Tijssen and Prof. Sarah

      "### **Looking back**\n\nAt the STI conference 2018 in Leiden, two strands of
      work at CWTS, the\nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) work in the\n[MoRRi](https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429298998-11){target=\"_blank\"}\nproject,
      and [the regional knowledge patterns for\ninnovation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\"_blank\"},\ngot
      together. We realized that\n[RRI](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs093){target=\"_blank\"}
      (demand\ndriven, contextual engagement in R&I) and the policy to focus on\nregional
      strength ([smart\nspecialization](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/what-we-do){target=\"_blank\"})\ncould
      be complementary and should be developed in a concerted way in\nregions. This
      happened to be the topic of the Horizon 2020 Science with\nand for Society (SwafS)
      14 call on ''Territorial RRI''. In 2020 (CHERRIES)\nand 2021 (RIPEET) two H2020
      3-year territorial RRI projects were\ngranted, in which CWTS is partnering.\n\n###
      **CHERRIES and RIPEET**\n\n[CHERRIES](http://cherries2020.eu){target=\"_blank\"}
      is about experiments\nin Responsible Healthcare systems. The main question is
      how CHERRIES\nexperiments can help investigate opportunities and challenges
      that are\nassociated with the role of need and demand within the healthcare\nsector.
      CHERRIES has 11 partners from 7 European countries -- Austria,\nBelgium, Italy,
      the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, Spain and\nSweden. Coordinated by ZSI
      (AT), the consortium brings together\nheterogeneous actors of the innovation
      ecosystem, including small and\nmedium enterprises, research institutions, universities,
      territorial\nauthorities, a hospital and a Civil Society Organisation to collectively\nreflect
      on and design policy experiments around enabling Responsible\nResearch and Innovation
      (RRI) in the healthcare sector in three European\nterritories: in Murcia (ES),
      \u00d6rebro (SE) and the Republic of Cyprus\n(CY).\n\n[RIPEET](http://ripeet.eu){target=\"_blank\"}
      is about Responsible energy\ntransition policy experiments. The purpose of RIPEET
      is to support\nterritories in establishing experimental spaces to address the\nterritorial
      dimensions of the European Green Deal. RRI-based Transition\nLabs will create
      collective stewardship of the territorial energy future\nvia participatory instruments
      and serve as a framework for envisioning\nsustainable energy futures. RIPEET
      has 11 partners from 7 European\ncountries -- Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy,
      Netherlands, Spain and\nthe UK. Coordinated by ZSI (AT), the consortium brings
      together\nquintuple helix actors (policy, industry, academia, civil society
      and\nthe environment); the team is highly inter- and transdisciplinary,\nbuilding
      on long lasting experiences in RRI, territorial innovation and\nsmart specialisation
      strategies and energy policy and research. The\n(RRI) policy experimentations
      for energy transition is investigated in\nthree European territories - in Extremadura
      (ES), Highlands and Islands\nof Scotland (UK) and Ostrobothnia (FI).\n\nIn the
      remainder of the blogpost we will introduce:\n\n1.  The CHERRIES model, and
      where RIPEET is different;\n2.  The tasks that CWTS is involved in based upon
      our expertise;\n3.  The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society
      interface;\n4.  What we do different in RIPEET, and how our work has developed
      into\n    a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described in more detail in\n    our
      next blogpost.\n\n### **The CHERRIES Model**\n\nThe CHERRIES team aimed to mobilise
      territorial stakeholder ecosystems\nand engaged them into regional pilot actions,
      applying an RRI framework.\nThe pilot actions include:\n\n1.  identify needs
      in the healthcare sector at territorial level\n    (through a call for needs);\n2.  encourage
      the proposition and co-creation of innovative solutions to\n    the identified
      needs (call for solutions);\n3.  stimulate institutional reflection processes
      on how to innovate\n    products and services in the healthcare sector through
      participatory\n    approaches;\n4.  present evidence-based recommendations for
      revision of sectoral\n    policies, strategies and innovation support instruments.\n\nThe
      CHERRIES model (below) is based upon co-creation activities with\nstakeholders,
      and testing in the regions. The model works well to\neffectively develop targeted
      innovations and provide legitimacy and\nmotivation through inclusion and engagement.
      However, it still lacks\nstrategic directionality and misses anchoring in regional
      processes.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/cherries-diagram.png\"\ndata-image=\"27862\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nIn the figures below, the topics of the healthcare innovation
      in the\nthree CHERRIES regions are depicted. Each of these pilot actions as
      such\nis carried out by local actors in a democratised fashion.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-murcia-orange-ribbon-hand.png\"\nstyle=\"width:75.0%\"
      data-image=\"27868\" />\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-Cyprus-open-call-doctor.png\"\nstyle=\"width:75.0%\"
      data-image=\"27866\" />\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-Orebro-open-call-chair.png\"\nstyle=\"width:75.0%\"
      data-image=\"27867\" />\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nRIPEET follows a largely similar
      approach with some changes. In RIPEET,\nthe regions each form a so-called Transition
      Lab, which is based on [the\nevolutionary model of socio-technical transitions
      (Geels and Schot,\n2007)](https://co-munity.net/system/files/Geels%20and%20Schot%202007%20-%20Typology%20of%20sociotechnical%20transition%20pathways.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      Energy Transition Labs (ETL) aim to set up spaces for learning,\ninteraction
      and interconnection between key actors (government, civil\nsociety, industry,
      academia) to collaboratively produce knowledge about\nthe current problems of
      the energy sector, the preferred future\nscenarios, and possible strategies
      to achieve a sustainable vision. It\nincludes joined reflection, visioning,
      and back casting before arriving\nat the needs identification and call for solutions
      which was just\nlaunched (September 2022).\n\n### **CWTS tasks in CHERRIES and
      RIPEET**\n\nIn CHERRIES, the role of CWTS is on tasks where the project can
      benefit\nfrom our expertise in RRI and regional innovation. We are involved
      in\nthe\n[mapping](https://dx.doi.org/10.22163/fteval.2022.543){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      existing local knowledge, qualitative work regarding the local policy\nmix and
      the project''s overall impact assessment / evaluation.\n\nThe mapping included
      a) identification of regional stakeholders in\nhealthcare, research, policy,
      and industry; b) collecting (national and\nregional) policies on smart specialisation,
      RRI aspects (including those\nreflecting the RRI-keys, such as Public Engagement,
      Ethics, Open Access,\nGender Equality, Science communication and governance)
      and healthcare\ninnovation; and c) mapping of regional science and technology
      strengths\nbased upon bibliometrics and project analysis. The rationale for
      the\nlatter being that regional innovation benefits from local strengths.\n\nThe
      policy approach in CHERRIES departed from the idea how\n[technological change
      (invention, innovation, diffusion) is faced with\nmultiple market, system and
      institutional failures and thus requires\nmulti-faceted policy interventions
      (Weber and Rohracher,\n2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000613){target=\"_blank\"}.\nA
      policy mix which combines several policy instruments would be the\nresponse
      to this challenge. However, during the project, the interactive\nsessions with
      the regional partners on policy revolved around two major,\nrelated, issues
      that are prerequisites for developing appropriate policy\nmixes: How can we
      develop arenas for deliberation that bring together\nstakeholders from different
      backgrounds to allow them to discuss policy\njointly, and how can we make the
      pilot actions sustainable? As with many\nprojects, there is no answer to what
      comes after the pilot.\n\nThe monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is currently ongoing.
      The focus is\non M&E of the territorial experimentations led by the local partners
      and\nthe overall impact assessment of CHERRIES as a project. In addition, M&E\nactivities
      take into consideration the translational abilities of an\ninterventionist project
      like CHERRIES locally and the changes these can\ntrigger. Hence, M&E is both
      inward and outward looking. It builds upon\nsystematic collection of information
      in bi-monthly evaluation sessions\nwith the regional partners on how implementation
      of smart specialisation\nand RRI is taking place, complemented with a site visit
      and evaluative\nconversations with stakeholders beyond the regional partners
      to assess\nhow CHERRIES may have affected or even changed local policy and\npractice.\n\nIn
      RIPEET, CWTS is involved in similar tasks.\n\n### **The learnings of CWTS on
      working at the science-society interface**\n\nSince 2014, CWTS is involved in
      Responsible Research and Innovation\n(RRI), through a range of activities and
      H2020-funded projects (e.g.\n[MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\"_blank\"},\n[NewHoRRIzon](https://newhorrizon.eu/){target=\"_blank\"},
      [SUPER\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}) bringing together
      R&I\npartners across Europe knowledgeable on RRI from different perspectives.\nOften
      these partners are universities, research institutes or\nnot-for-profit research
      organisations, for which ''the project'' is an\ninstrument to do research whilst
      engaging with others in the field. In\nCHERRIES, 3 partners represent such a
      research background, of which CWTS\nis one. The aim of the RRI projects funded
      through the (SwafS) programme\nfrom an EC perspective is to bring RRI to the
      region, or to implement\nthe European-oriented RRI policy in regional contexts.
      One of the major\nlearnings is that there is a big gap between ''a policy''
      (RRI in this\ncase) and bringing it to life in actual research and innovation\npractices.
      While co-creation is put central, projects such as CHERRIES\nand RIPEET require
      translation between the stakeholders involved and\ntheir diverse needs and wishes
      and the researchers in the projects.\nStakeholders occupy different worlds and
      want and need different things\nfrom our projects. It is important to become
      aware of this diversity.\nDrawing on [Michel Callon''s sociology of\ntranslation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00113.x){target=\"_blank\"},\nseveral
      challenges needed to be addressed in the ''problematization,\ninvolvement, enrollment
      and representation'' in CHERRIES: Who actually\ndefines the regional healthcare
      problem? Project partners, stakeholders,\nfunder?\u200b When involving and engaging
      with non-academic stakeholders: who\ntakes ownership of processes, what are
      power dynamics and how do we\ninclude diversity?\u200b And thirdly, how do we
      translate projects into\nrepresentative and effective narratives and indicators,
      that fit with\nthe local needs and contexts. One of the major conclusions is
      that RRI\nas a policy when put into practice is operationalized differently
      in\ndifferent contexts, and that these contexts should lead the way. The\naction
      research approach we eventually developed [around evaluative\nconversations](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\"_blank\"}
      works\nwell.\n\n### **What we do different in RIPEET**\n\nWhilst CHERRIES and
      RIPEET are different in their topic (healthcare and\nenergy transition) and
      regional partners, they are similar in their\nset-up and approach. Because we
      started with RIPEET exactly a year\nlater, we at CWTS were able to improve how
      to connect our contribution\nto the rest of the project. This was particularly
      relevant since in\nCHERRIES we realised that preparing a mapping, including
      bibliometrics,\ngoes well beyond the interest and understanding of the partners.
      In\nother words, to make our contribution useful for our partners and\nbeyond,
      we as well should translate the needs and adjust our work. In\nRIPEET, we therefore
      worked much more demand-driven, leaving the lead to\nthe regional partners,
      as the mapping should serve their purpose, and\nnot necessarily our own ideas.
      So the mapping exercise became an\nintegral part of the Transition labs, and
      was co-created with the local\npartners. Interestingly, the joint mapping, in
      an iterative process,\nresulted in partly similar topics of attention (CWTS
      and region), but\nalso additional ones that were shaped by local context and
      needs, and\nalso, types of partners involved in the process. As such, the ownership\nof
      the mapping process was better accounted for.\n\nOur work, combining mapping

      **Looking back**\\n\\nAt the STI conference 2018 in Leiden, two strands of work
      at CWTS, the\\nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) work in the\\n[MoRRi](https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429298998-11){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject,
      and [the regional knowledge patterns for\\ninnovation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\ngot
      together. We realized that\\n[RRI](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs093){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (demand\\ndriven, contextual engagement in R&I) and the policy to focus on\\nregional
      strength ([smart\\nspecialization](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/what-we-do){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\ncould
      be complementary and should be developed in a concerted way in\\nregions. This
      happened to be the topic of the Horizon 2020 Science with\\nand for Society
      (SwafS) 14 call on 'Territorial RRI'. In 2020 (CHERRIES)\\nand 2021 (RIPEET)
      two H2020 3-year territorial RRI projects were\\ngranted, in which CWTS is partnering.\\n\\n###
      **CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\n[CHERRIES](http://cherries2020.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about experiments\\nin Responsible Healthcare systems. The main question
      is how CHERRIES\\nexperiments can help investigate opportunities and challenges
      that are\\nassociated with the role of need and demand within the healthcare\\nsector.
      CHERRIES has 11 partners from 7 European countries -- Austria,\\nBelgium, Italy,
      the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, Spain and\\nSweden. Coordinated by
      ZSI (AT), the consortium brings together\\nheterogeneous actors of the innovation
      ecosystem, including small and\\nmedium enterprises, research institutions,
      universities, territorial\\nauthorities, a hospital and a Civil Society Organisation
      to collectively\\nreflect on and design policy experiments around enabling Responsible\\nResearch
      and Innovation (RRI) in the healthcare sector in three European\\nterritories:
      in Murcia (ES), \xD6rebro (SE) and the Republic of Cyprus\\n(CY).\\n\\n[RIPEET](http://ripeet.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about Responsible energy\\ntransition policy experiments. The purpose of
      RIPEET is to support\\nterritories in establishing experimental spaces to address
      the\\nterritorial dimensions of the European Green Deal. RRI-based Transition\\nLabs
      will create collective stewardship of the territorial energy future\\nvia participatory
      instruments and serve as a framework for envisioning\\nsustainable energy futures.
      RIPEET has 11 partners from 7 European\\ncountries -- Austria, Belgium, Finland,
      Italy, Netherlands, Spain and\\nthe UK. Coordinated by ZSI (AT), the consortium
      brings together\\nquintuple helix actors (policy, industry, academia, civil
      society and\\nthe environment); the team is highly inter- and transdisciplinary,\\nbuilding
      on long lasting experiences in RRI, territorial innovation and\\nsmart specialisation
      strategies and energy policy and research. The\\n(RRI) policy experimentations
      for energy transition is investigated in\\nthree European territories - in Extremadura
      (ES), Highlands and Islands\\nof Scotland (UK) and Ostrobothnia (FI).\\n\\nIn
      the remainder of the blogpost we will introduce:\\n\\n1.  The CHERRIES model,
      and where RIPEET is different;\\n2.  The tasks that CWTS is involved in based
      upon our expertise;\\n3.  The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society
      interface;\\n4.  What we do different in RIPEET, and how our work has developed
      into\\n    a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described in more detail in\\n
      \   our next blogpost.\\n\\n### **The CHERRIES Model**\\n\\nThe CHERRIES team
      aimed to mobilise territorial stakeholder ecosystems\\nand engaged them into
      regional pilot actions, applying an RRI framework.\\nThe pilot actions include:\\n\\n1.
      \ identify needs in the healthcare sector at territorial level\\n    (through
      a call for needs);\\n2.  encourage the proposition and co-creation of innovative
      solutions to\\n    the identified needs (call for solutions);\\n3.  stimulate
      institutional reflection processes on how to innovate\\n    products and services
      in the healthcare sector through participatory\\n    approaches;\\n4.  present
      evidence-based recommendations for revision of sectoral\\n    policies, strategies
      and innovation support instruments.\\n\\nThe CHERRIES model (below) is based
      upon co-creation activities with\\nstakeholders, and testing in the regions.
      The model works well to\\neffectively develop targeted innovations and provide
      legitimacy and\\nmotivation through inclusion and engagement. However, it still
      lacks\\nstrategic directionality and misses anchoring in regional processes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/cherries-diagram.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"27862\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nIn the figures below, the topics of the healthcare
      innovation in the\\nthree CHERRIES regions are depicted. Each of these pilot
      actions as such\\nis carried out by local actors in a democratised fashion.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-murcia-orange-ribbon-hand.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"
      data-image=\\\"27868\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-Cyprus-open-call-doctor.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"

      data-image=\\\"27867\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nRIPEET follows a largely
      similar approach with some changes. In RIPEET,\\nthe regions each form a so-called
      Transition Lab, which is based on [the\\nevolutionary model of socio-technical
      transitions (Geels and Schot,\\n2007)](https://co-munity.net/system/files/Geels%20and%20Schot%202007%20-%20Typology%20of%20sociotechnical%20transition%20pathways.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      Energy Transition Labs (ETL) aim to set up spaces for learning,\\ninteraction
      and interconnection between key actors (government, civil\\nsociety, industry,
      academia) to collaboratively produce knowledge about\\nthe current problems
      of the energy sector, the preferred future\\nscenarios, and possible strategies
      to achieve a sustainable vision. It\\nincludes joined reflection, visioning,
      and back casting before arriving\\nat the needs identification and call for
      solutions which was just\\nlaunched (September 2022).\\n\\n### **CWTS tasks
      in CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\nIn CHERRIES, the role of CWTS is on tasks where
      the project can benefit\\nfrom our expertise in RRI and regional innovation.
      We are involved in\\nthe\\n[mapping](https://dx.doi.org/10.22163/fteval.2022.543){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      existing local knowledge, qualitative work regarding the local policy\\nmix
      and the project's overall impact assessment / evaluation.\\n\\nThe mapping included
      a) identification of regional stakeholders in\\nhealthcare, research, policy,
      and industry; b) collecting (national and\\nregional) policies on smart specialisation,
      RRI aspects (including those\\nreflecting the RRI-keys, such as Public Engagement,
      Ethics, Open Access,\\nGender Equality, Science communication and governance)
      and healthcare\\ninnovation; and c) mapping of regional science and technology
      strengths\\nbased upon bibliometrics and project analysis. The rationale for
      the\\nlatter being that regional innovation benefits from local strengths.\\n\\nThe
      policy approach in CHERRIES departed from the idea how\\n[technological change
      (invention, innovation, diffusion) is faced with\\nmultiple market, system and
      institutional failures and thus requires\\nmulti-faceted policy interventions
      (Weber and Rohracher,\\n2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000613){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      policy mix which combines several policy instruments would be the\\nresponse
      to this challenge. However, during the project, the interactive\\nsessions with
      the regional partners on policy revolved around two major,\\nrelated, issues
      that are prerequisites for developing appropriate policy\\nmixes: How can we
      develop arenas for deliberation that bring together\\nstakeholders from different
      backgrounds to allow them to discuss policy\\njointly, and how can we make the
      pilot actions sustainable? As with many\\nprojects, there is no answer to what
      comes after the pilot.\\n\\nThe monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is currently
      ongoing. The focus is\\non M&E of the territorial experimentations led by the
      local partners and\\nthe overall impact assessment of CHERRIES as a project.
      In addition, M&E\\nactivities take into consideration the translational abilities
      of an\\ninterventionist project like CHERRIES locally and the changes these
      can\\ntrigger. Hence, M&E is both inward and outward looking. It builds upon\\nsystematic
      collection of information in bi-monthly evaluation sessions\\nwith the regional
      partners on how implementation of smart specialisation\\nand RRI is taking place,
      complemented with a site visit and evaluative\\nconversations with stakeholders
      beyond the regional partners to assess\\nhow CHERRIES may have affected or even
      changed local policy and\\npractice.\\n\\nIn RIPEET, CWTS is involved in similar
      tasks.\\n\\n### **The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society interface**\\n\\nSince
      2014, CWTS is involved in Responsible Research and Innovation\\n(RRI), through
      a range of activities and H2020-funded projects (e.g.\\n[MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[NewHoRRIzon](https://newhorrizon.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}) bringing together
      R&I\\npartners across Europe knowledgeable on RRI from different perspectives.\\nOften
      these partners are universities, research institutes or\\nnot-for-profit research
      organisations, for which 'the project' is an\\ninstrument to do research whilst
      engaging with others in the field. In\\nCHERRIES, 3 partners represent such
      a research background, of which CWTS\\nis one. The aim of the RRI projects funded
      through the (SwafS) programme\\nfrom an EC perspective is to bring RRI to the
      region, or to implement\\nthe European-oriented RRI policy in regional contexts.
      One of the major\\nlearnings is that there is a big gap between 'a policy' (RRI
      in this\\ncase) and bringing it to life in actual research and innovation\\npractices.
      While co-creation is put central, projects such as CHERRIES\\nand RIPEET require
      translation between the stakeholders involved and\\ntheir diverse needs and
      wishes and the researchers in the projects.\\nStakeholders occupy different
      worlds and want and need different things\\nfrom our projects. It is important
      to become aware of this diversity.\\nDrawing on [Michel Callon's sociology of\\ntranslation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00113.x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nseveral
      challenges needed to be addressed in the 'problematization,\\ninvolvement, enrollment
      and representation' in CHERRIES: Who actually\\ndefines the regional healthcare
      problem? Project partners, stakeholders,\\nfunder?\u200B When involving and
      engaging with non-academic stakeholders: who\\ntakes ownership of processes,
      what are power dynamics and how do we\\ninclude diversity?\u200B And thirdly,
      how do we translate projects into\\nrepresentative and effective narratives
      and indicators, that fit with\\nthe local needs and contexts. One of the major
      conclusions is that RRI\\nas a policy when put into practice is operationalized
      differently in\\ndifferent contexts, and that these contexts should lead the
      way. The\\naction research approach we eventually developed [around evaluative\\nconversations](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      works\\nwell.\\n\\n### **What we do different in RIPEET**\\n\\nWhilst CHERRIES
      and RIPEET are different in their topic (healthcare and\\nenergy transition)
      and regional partners, they are similar in their\\nset-up and approach. Because
      we started with RIPEET exactly a year\\nlater, we at CWTS were able to improve
      how to connect our contribution\\nto the rest of the project. This was particularly
      relevant since in\\nCHERRIES we realised that preparing a mapping, including
      bibliometrics,\\ngoes well beyond the interest and understanding of the partners.
      In\\nother words, to make our contribution useful for our partners and\\nbeyond,
      we as well should translate the needs and adjust our work. In\\nRIPEET, we therefore
      worked much more demand-driven, leaving the lead to\\nthe regional partners,
      as the mapping should serve their purpose, and\\nnot necessarily our own ideas.
      So the mapping exercise became an\\nintegral part of the Transition labs, and
      was co-created with the local\\npartners. Interestingly, the joint mapping,
      in an iterative process,\\nresulted in partly similar topics of attention (CWTS
      and region), but\\nalso additional ones that were shaped by local context and
      needs, and\\nalso, types of partners involved in the process. As such, the ownership\\nof
      the mapping process was better accounted for.\\n\\nOur work, combining mapping
      and evaluative conversations to serve both\\nRRI and Smart Specialisation (a
      regional innovation policy) has\\ndeveloped into a methodology, EXPLORE, which
      will be described in more\\ndetail in our next blogpost.\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      the territorial RRI projects have allowed us to travel\\nand explore the science-society
      interface by engaging with local\\nnon-academic stakeholders from the start;
      to become embedded action\\nresearchers in a co-creative process, and to realise
      that it takes a lot\\nof effort to bring science out of its own world to society.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cherries-and-ripeet-cwts-traveling-the-science-society-interface\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      **Looking back**\\n\\nAt the STI conference 2018 in Leiden, two strands of work
      at CWTS, the\\nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) work in the\\n[MoRRi](https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429298998-11){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nproject,
      and [the regional knowledge patterns for\\ninnovation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2019.1645814){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\ngot
      together. We realized that\\n[RRI](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scs093){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      (demand\\ndriven, contextual engagement in R&I) and the policy to focus on\\nregional
      strength ([smart\\nspecialization](https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/what-we-do){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\ncould
      be complementary and should be developed in a concerted way in\\nregions. This
      happened to be the topic of the Horizon 2020 Science with\\nand for Society
      (SwafS) 14 call on 'Territorial RRI'. In 2020 (CHERRIES)\\nand 2021 (RIPEET)
      two H2020 3-year territorial RRI projects were\\ngranted, in which CWTS is partnering.\\n\\n###
      **CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\n[CHERRIES](http://cherries2020.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about experiments\\nin Responsible Healthcare systems. The main question
      is how CHERRIES\\nexperiments can help investigate opportunities and challenges
      that are\\nassociated with the role of need and demand within the healthcare\\nsector.
      CHERRIES has 11 partners from 7 European countries -- Austria,\\nBelgium, Italy,
      the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, Spain and\\nSweden. Coordinated by
      ZSI (AT), the consortium brings together\\nheterogeneous actors of the innovation
      ecosystem, including small and\\nmedium enterprises, research institutions,
      universities, territorial\\nauthorities, a hospital and a Civil Society Organisation
      to collectively\\nreflect on and design policy experiments around enabling Responsible\\nResearch
      and Innovation (RRI) in the healthcare sector in three European\\nterritories:
      in Murcia (ES), \xD6rebro (SE) and the Republic of Cyprus\\n(CY).\\n\\n[RIPEET](http://ripeet.eu){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is about Responsible energy\\ntransition policy experiments. The purpose of
      RIPEET is to support\\nterritories in establishing experimental spaces to address
      the\\nterritorial dimensions of the European Green Deal. RRI-based Transition\\nLabs
      will create collective stewardship of the territorial energy future\\nvia participatory
      instruments and serve as a framework for envisioning\\nsustainable energy futures.
      RIPEET has 11 partners from 7 European\\ncountries -- Austria, Belgium, Finland,
      Italy, Netherlands, Spain and\\nthe UK. Coordinated by ZSI (AT), the consortium
      brings together\\nquintuple helix actors (policy, industry, academia, civil
      society and\\nthe environment); the team is highly inter- and transdisciplinary,\\nbuilding
      on long lasting experiences in RRI, territorial innovation and\\nsmart specialisation
      strategies and energy policy and research. The\\n(RRI) policy experimentations
      for energy transition is investigated in\\nthree European territories - in Extremadura
      (ES), Highlands and Islands\\nof Scotland (UK) and Ostrobothnia (FI).\\n\\nIn
      the remainder of the blogpost we will introduce:\\n\\n1.  The CHERRIES model,
      and where RIPEET is different;\\n2.  The tasks that CWTS is involved in based
      upon our expertise;\\n3.  The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society
      interface;\\n4.  What we do different in RIPEET, and how our work has developed
      into\\n    a methodology, EXPLORE, which will be described in more detail in\\n
      \   our next blogpost.\\n\\n### **The CHERRIES Model**\\n\\nThe CHERRIES team
      aimed to mobilise territorial stakeholder ecosystems\\nand engaged them into
      regional pilot actions, applying an RRI framework.\\nThe pilot actions include:\\n\\n1.
      \ identify needs in the healthcare sector at territorial level\\n    (through
      a call for needs);\\n2.  encourage the proposition and co-creation of innovative
      solutions to\\n    the identified needs (call for solutions);\\n3.  stimulate
      institutional reflection processes on how to innovate\\n    products and services
      in the healthcare sector through participatory\\n    approaches;\\n4.  present
      evidence-based recommendations for revision of sectoral\\n    policies, strategies
      and innovation support instruments.\\n\\nThe CHERRIES model (below) is based
      upon co-creation activities with\\nstakeholders, and testing in the regions.
      The model works well to\\neffectively develop targeted innovations and provide
      legitimacy and\\nmotivation through inclusion and engagement. However, it still
      lacks\\nstrategic directionality and misses anchoring in regional processes.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/cherries-diagram.png\\\"\\ndata-image=\\\"27862\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nIn the figures below, the topics of the healthcare
      innovation in the\\nthree CHERRIES regions are depicted. Each of these pilot
      actions as such\\nis carried out by local actors in a democratised fashion.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/CHERRIES-murcia-orange-ribbon-hand.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"width:75.0%\\\"

      data-image=\\\"27867\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nRIPEET follows a largely
      similar approach with some changes. In RIPEET,\\nthe regions each form a so-called
      Transition Lab, which is based on [the\\nevolutionary model of socio-technical
      transitions (Geels and Schot,\\n2007)](https://co-munity.net/system/files/Geels%20and%20Schot%202007%20-%20Typology%20of%20sociotechnical%20transition%20pathways.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nThe
      Energy Transition Labs (ETL) aim to set up spaces for learning,\\ninteraction
      and interconnection between key actors (government, civil\\nsociety, industry,
      academia) to collaboratively produce knowledge about\\nthe current problems
      of the energy sector, the preferred future\\nscenarios, and possible strategies
      to achieve a sustainable vision. It\\nincludes joined reflection, visioning,
      and back casting before arriving\\nat the needs identification and call for
      solutions which was just\\nlaunched (September 2022).\\n\\n### **CWTS tasks
      in CHERRIES and RIPEET**\\n\\nIn CHERRIES, the role of CWTS is on tasks where
      the project can benefit\\nfrom our expertise in RRI and regional innovation.
      We are involved in\\nthe\\n[mapping](https://dx.doi.org/10.22163/fteval.2022.543){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      existing local knowledge, qualitative work regarding the local policy\\nmix
      and the project's overall impact assessment / evaluation.\\n\\nThe mapping included
      a) identification of regional stakeholders in\\nhealthcare, research, policy,
      and industry; b) collecting (national and\\nregional) policies on smart specialisation,
      RRI aspects (including those\\nreflecting the RRI-keys, such as Public Engagement,
      Ethics, Open Access,\\nGender Equality, Science communication and governance)
      and healthcare\\ninnovation; and c) mapping of regional science and technology
      strengths\\nbased upon bibliometrics and project analysis. The rationale for
      the\\nlatter being that regional innovation benefits from local strengths.\\n\\nThe
      policy approach in CHERRIES departed from the idea how\\n[technological change
      (invention, innovation, diffusion) is faced with\\nmultiple market, system and
      institutional failures and thus requires\\nmulti-faceted policy interventions
      (Weber and Rohracher,\\n2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733312000613){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      policy mix which combines several policy instruments would be the\\nresponse
      to this challenge. However, during the project, the interactive\\nsessions with
      the regional partners on policy revolved around two major,\\nrelated, issues
      that are prerequisites for developing appropriate policy\\nmixes: How can we
      develop arenas for deliberation that bring together\\nstakeholders from different
      backgrounds to allow them to discuss policy\\njointly, and how can we make the
      pilot actions sustainable? As with many\\nprojects, there is no answer to what
      comes after the pilot.\\n\\nThe monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is currently
      ongoing. The focus is\\non M&E of the territorial experimentations led by the
      local partners and\\nthe overall impact assessment of CHERRIES as a project.
      In addition, M&E\\nactivities take into consideration the translational abilities
      of an\\ninterventionist project like CHERRIES locally and the changes these
      can\\ntrigger. Hence, M&E is both inward and outward looking. It builds upon\\nsystematic
      collection of information in bi-monthly evaluation sessions\\nwith the regional
      partners on how implementation of smart specialisation\\nand RRI is taking place,
      complemented with a site visit and evaluative\\nconversations with stakeholders
      beyond the regional partners to assess\\nhow CHERRIES may have affected or even
      changed local policy and\\npractice.\\n\\nIn RIPEET, CWTS is involved in similar
      tasks.\\n\\n### **The learnings of CWTS on working at the science-society interface**\\n\\nSince
      2014, CWTS is involved in Responsible Research and Innovation\\n(RRI), through
      a range of activities and H2020-funded projects (e.g.\\n[MoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/morri-2014-2018/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[NewHoRRIzon](https://newhorrizon.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      [SUPER\\nMoRRI](https://super-morri.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}) bringing together
      R&I\\npartners across Europe knowledgeable on RRI from different perspectives.\\nOften
      these partners are universities, research institutes or\\nnot-for-profit research
      organisations, for which 'the project' is an\\ninstrument to do research whilst
      engaging with others in the field. In\\nCHERRIES, 3 partners represent such
      a research background, of which CWTS\\nis one. The aim of the RRI projects funded
      through the (SwafS) programme\\nfrom an EC perspective is to bring RRI to the
      region, or to implement\\nthe European-oriented RRI policy in regional contexts.
      One of the major\\nlearnings is that there is a big gap between 'a policy' (RRI
      in this\\ncase) and bringing it to life in actual research and innovation\\npractices.
      While co-creation is put central, projects such as CHERRIES\\nand RIPEET require
      translation between the stakeholders involved and\\ntheir diverse needs and
      wishes and the researchers in the projects.\\nStakeholders occupy different
      worlds and want and need different things\\nfrom our projects. It is important
      to become aware of this diversity.\\nDrawing on [Michel Callon's sociology of\\ntranslation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00113.x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nseveral
      challenges needed to be addressed in the 'problematization,\\ninvolvement, enrollment
      and representation' in CHERRIES: Who actually\\ndefines the regional healthcare
      problem? Project partners, stakeholders,\\nfunder?\u200B When involving and
      engaging with non-academic stakeholders: who\\ntakes ownership of processes,
      what are power dynamics and how do we\\ninclude diversity?\u200B And thirdly,
      how do we translate projects into\\nrepresentative and effective narratives
      and indicators, that fit with\\nthe local needs and contexts. One of the major
      conclusions is that RRI\\nas a policy when put into practice is operationalized
      differently in\\ndifferent contexts, and that these contexts should lead the
      way. The\\naction research approach we eventually developed [around evaluative\\nconversations](https://repository.fteval.at/604/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      works\\nwell.\\n\\n### **What we do different in RIPEET**\\n\\nWhilst CHERRIES
      and RIPEET are different in their topic (healthcare and\\nenergy transition)
      and regional partners, they are similar in their\\nset-up and approach. Because
      we started with RIPEET exactly a year\\nlater, we at CWTS were able to improve
      how to connect our contribution\\nto the rest of the project. This was particularly
      relevant since in\\nCHERRIES we realised that preparing a mapping, including
      bibliometrics,\\ngoes well beyond the interest and understanding of the partners.
      In\\nother words, to make our contribution useful for our partners and\\nbeyond,
      we as well should translate the needs and adjust our work. In\\nRIPEET, we therefore
      worked much more demand-driven, leaving the lead to\\nthe regional partners,
      as the mapping should serve their purpose, and\\nnot necessarily our own ideas.
      So the mapping exercise became an\\nintegral part of the Transition labs, and
      was co-created with the local\\npartners. Interestingly, the joint mapping,
      in an iterative process,\\nresulted in partly similar topics of attention (CWTS
      and region), but\\nalso additional ones that were shaped by local context and
      needs, and\\nalso, types of partners involved in the process. As such, the ownership\\nof
      the mapping process was better accounted for.\\n\\nOur work, combining mapping
      and evaluative conversations to serve both\\nRRI and Smart Specialisation (a
      regional innovation policy) has\\ndeveloped into a methodology, EXPLORE, which
      will be described in more\\ndetail in our next blogpost.\\n\\nIn conclusion,
      the territorial RRI projects have allowed us to travel\\nand explore the science-society
      interface by engaging with local\\nnon-academic stakeholders from the start;
      to become embedded action\\nresearchers in a co-creative process, and to realise
      that it takes a lot\\nof effort to bring science out of its own world to society.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/cherries-and-ripeet-cwts-traveling-the-science-society-interface\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      research and highlight how DeSci efforts might\ncontribute to improve the way
      we do science. SciCon has been organized\nby one of the leading DeSci initiatives:\n[ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nWhile
      the conference included tutorials, community workshops and even a\nweek-long
      community competition to write new contributions, talks were\norganized over
      two days and included a rich set of topics. Several\nprominent DeSci projects
      and initiatives were presented, with themes as\nvaried as decentralized medical

      online, I invite you to take a closer look.\n\n### Decentralized Science\n\nBut
      what is DeSci exactly? On\n[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/){target=\"_blank\"},
      we find\nthe following definition:\n\nIn short, projects in DeSci apply blockchain
      technology to science.\nDeSci is inspired by the open knowledge movement and
      related to the open\nsoftware and open science communities and efforts.\n\nIn
      a brief period, the DeSci landscape grew substantially on the onset\nof the
      general 2021 blockchain and crypto currency boom.\n\nA recent illustration of
      the DeSci landscape is provided in the [DeSci\nWiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit){target=\"_blank\"}*(@UltraRare\nBio)*:\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_picture1.jpg\"\nalt=\"Desci
      picture1\" />\n</figure>\n\nThe DeSci movement is diverse, yet several biotechnology
      initiatives\nstand out, including funding organizations, decentralized laboratories,\nincubators
      and more.\n[Molecule](https://www.molecule.to/){target=\"_blank\"} is developing
      a\ndecentralized protocol to fund and manage research-related IP\n(Intellectual
      Property) in biotech.\u00a0Key to Molecule''s approach is the\nuse of blockchains
      to accelerate funding biotech research and building a\nmarketplace for the generated
      IP. They recently raised above 12M\\$ in\nventure funds for future development.
      Many more Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs) also play a prominent
      role in DeSci. These are\ncommunities managed via blockchains, sometimes associated
      with\nincorporated entities (e.g., companies), just like Molecule. Another\nexample
      is [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/){target=\"_blank\"}, focused\non crowdfunding
      longevity research through the VITA token.\n\nScientific publishing also attracts
      considerable effort in DeSci,\nespecially towards re-designing the peer review
      system. Science\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used to record and manage scientific\noutputs,
      for example Intellectual Property, reviews and publications.\nSeveral initiatives
      focus on funding research or other forms of commons\nwith a considerable degree
      of different instruments. [Gitcoin\nGrants](https://gitcoin.co/grants){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0fund
      public commons\nvia [Quadratic Funding, an optimal way for crowdfunding public
      resources\nwithin a community](https://wtfisqf.com/){target=\"_blank\"}.\u00a0Lastly,
      it\nis worth mentioning that some research-focused organizations have also\nbeen
      started with ties, yet not a direct involvement with DeSci. For\nexample, the
      [Astera Institute specializes in frontier research and\ntechnology projects
      (including on metascience) using Focused Research\nOrganizations (FROs)](https://astera.org/fros){target=\"_blank\"}
      as an\ninstrument to combine the two.\n\nOn this [site](https://ethereum.org/en/desci){target=\"_blank\"},
      we can\nfind an (optimistic) overview of the ways in which DeSci could\ncontribute
      to improve the scientific ecosystem:  \n\n| Decentralized Science                                                                                                 |

      The event\\n\\n[SciCon\\n2022](https://researchhubevents.wixsite.com/scicon2022){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_has\\nbeen
      an online event seeking to bring together members of the academic\\nmetascience
      community and DeSci, to discuss some of the issues that\\nexist in scientific
      research and highlight how DeSci efforts might\\ncontribute to improve the way
      we do science. SciCon has been organized\\nby one of the leading DeSci initiatives:\\n[ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWhile
      the conference included tutorials, community workshops and even a\\nweek-long
      community competition to write new contributions, talks were\\norganized over
      two days and included a rich set of topics. Several\\nprominent DeSci projects
      and initiatives were presented, with themes as\\nvaried as decentralized medical
      trials (Azizi Seixas, NYU's Langone\\nHealth), decentralized research centers
      (Eugene Leventhal, Smart\\nContract Research Forum), open verifiability and
      reproducible, on-chain\\nscientific records (Christopher Hill, DeSci Labs),
      among many more. For\\nthe metascience community, Silvio Peroni presented on
      how to enable\\nreproducible studies through [Open\\nCitations](https://opencitations.net/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Ludo
      Waltman\\nintroduced the recently launched [\\\"Publish your Reviews\\\"\\ninitiative](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_while\\nI
      presented on the (selfish) [advantages of making research data\\nopen](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n[In

      co-founders of ResearchHub Patrick Joyce and Brian Armstrong further\\nexplained

      online, I invite you to take a closer look.\\n\\n### Decentralized Science\\n\\nBut
      what is DeSci exactly? On\\n[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we find\\nthe following definition:\\n\\nIn short, projects in DeSci apply blockchain
      technology to science.\\nDeSci is inspired by the open knowledge movement and
      related to the open\\nsoftware and open science communities and efforts.\\n\\nIn
      a brief period, the DeSci landscape grew substantially on the onset\\nof the
      general 2021 blockchain and crypto currency boom.\\n\\nA recent illustration
      of the DeSci landscape is provided in the [DeSci\\nWiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*(@UltraRare\\nBio)*:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_picture1.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Desci
      picture1\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe DeSci movement is diverse, yet several
      biotechnology initiatives\\nstand out, including funding organizations, decentralized
      laboratories,\\nincubators and more.\\n[Molecule](https://www.molecule.to/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is developing a\\ndecentralized protocol to fund and manage research-related
      IP\\n(Intellectual Property) in biotech.\_Key to Molecule's approach is the\\nuse
      of blockchains to accelerate funding biotech research and building a\\nmarketplace
      for the generated IP. They recently raised above 12M\\\\$ in\\nventure funds
      for future development. Many more Decentralized Autonomous\\nOrganizations (DAOs)
      also play a prominent role in DeSci. These are\\ncommunities managed via blockchains,
      sometimes associated with\\nincorporated entities (e.g., companies), just like
      Molecule. Another\\nexample is [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      focused\\non crowdfunding longevity research through the VITA token.\\n\\nScientific
      publishing also attracts considerable effort in DeSci,\\nespecially towards
      re-designing the peer review system. Science\\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are
      used to record and manage scientific\\noutputs, for example Intellectual Property,
      reviews and publications.\\nSeveral initiatives focus on funding research or
      other forms of commons\\nwith a considerable degree of different instruments.
      [Gitcoin\\nGrants](https://gitcoin.co/grants){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_fund public
      commons\\nvia [Quadratic Funding, an optimal way for crowdfunding public resources\\nwithin
      a community](https://wtfisqf.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\_Lastly, it\\nis
      worth mentioning that some research-focused organizations have also\\nbeen started
      with ties, yet not a direct involvement with DeSci. For\\nexample, the [Astera
      Institute specializes in frontier research and\\ntechnology projects (including
      on metascience) using Focused Research\\nOrganizations (FROs)](https://astera.org/fros){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      as an\\ninstrument to combine the two.\\n\\nOn this [site](https://ethereum.org/en/desci){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we can\\nfind an (optimistic) overview of the ways in which DeSci could\\ncontribute
      to improve the scientific ecosystem:  \\n\\n| Decentralized Science                                                                                                 |

      1\\\\. Distribution of funds is determined by the public using mechanisms such
      as quadratic donations or DAOs.           | Small, closed, centralized groups
      control the distribution of funds.                                           |\\n|
      2\\\\. You collaborate with peers from all over the globe in dynamic teams.
      \                                             | Funding organizations and home

      are explored.                         | Funding decisions are made with a long
      turnaround time and limited transparency. Few funding mechanisms exist. |\\n|
      4\\\\. Sharing laboratory services is made easier and more transparent using
      Web3 primitives.                            | Sharing laboratory resources is
      often slow and opaque.                                                         |\\n|
      5\\\\. New models for publishing can be developed that use Web3 primitives for
      trust, transparency and universal access. | You publish through established
      pathways frequently acknowledged as inefficient, biased and exploitative.      |\\n|
      6\\\\. You can earn tokens and reputation for peer-reviewing work.                                                       |

      The event\\n\\n[SciCon\\n2022](https://researchhubevents.wixsite.com/scicon2022){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_has\\nbeen
      an online event seeking to bring together members of the academic\\nmetascience
      community and DeSci, to discuss some of the issues that\\nexist in scientific
      research and highlight how DeSci efforts might\\ncontribute to improve the way
      we do science. SciCon has been organized\\nby one of the leading DeSci initiatives:\\n[ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nWhile
      the conference included tutorials, community workshops and even a\\nweek-long
      community competition to write new contributions, talks were\\norganized over
      two days and included a rich set of topics. Several\\nprominent DeSci projects
      and initiatives were presented, with themes as\\nvaried as decentralized medical
      trials (Azizi Seixas, NYU's Langone\\nHealth), decentralized research centers
      (Eugene Leventhal, Smart\\nContract Research Forum), open verifiability and
      reproducible, on-chain\\nscientific records (Christopher Hill, DeSci Labs),
      among many more. For\\nthe metascience community, Silvio Peroni presented on
      how to enable\\nreproducible studies through [Open\\nCitations](https://opencitations.net/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_Ludo
      Waltman\\nintroduced the recently launched [\\\"Publish your Reviews\\\"\\ninitiative](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\_while\\nI

      online, I invite you to take a closer look.\\n\\n### Decentralized Science\\n\\nBut
      what is DeSci exactly? On\\n[Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we find\\nthe following definition:\\n\\nIn short, projects in DeSci apply blockchain
      technology to science.\\nDeSci is inspired by the open knowledge movement and
      related to the open\\nsoftware and open science communities and efforts.\\n\\nIn
      a brief period, the DeSci landscape grew substantially on the onset\\nof the
      general 2021 blockchain and crypto currency boom.\\n\\nA recent illustration
      of the DeSci landscape is provided in the [DeSci\\nWiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}*(@UltraRare\\nBio)*:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_picture1.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Desci
      picture1\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe DeSci movement is diverse, yet several
      biotechnology initiatives\\nstand out, including funding organizations, decentralized
      laboratories,\\nincubators and more.\\n[Molecule](https://www.molecule.to/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      is developing a\\ndecentralized protocol to fund and manage research-related
      IP\\n(Intellectual Property) in biotech.\_Key to Molecule's approach is the\\nuse
      of blockchains to accelerate funding biotech research and building a\\nmarketplace
      for the generated IP. They recently raised above 12M\\\\$ in\\nventure funds
      for future development. Many more Decentralized Autonomous\\nOrganizations (DAOs)
      also play a prominent role in DeSci. These are\\ncommunities managed via blockchains,
      sometimes associated with\\nincorporated entities (e.g., companies), just like
      Molecule. Another\\nexample is [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      focused\\non crowdfunding longevity research through the VITA token.\\n\\nScientific
      publishing also attracts considerable effort in DeSci,\\nespecially towards
      re-designing the peer review system. Science\\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are
      used to record and manage scientific\\noutputs, for example Intellectual Property,
      reviews and publications.\\nSeveral initiatives focus on funding research or
      other forms of commons\\nwith a considerable degree of different instruments.
      [Gitcoin\\nGrants](https://gitcoin.co/grants){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_fund public
      commons\\nvia [Quadratic Funding, an optimal way for crowdfunding public resources\\nwithin
      a community](https://wtfisqf.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\_Lastly, it\\nis
      worth mentioning that some research-focused organizations have also\\nbeen started
      with ties, yet not a direct involvement with DeSci. For\\nexample, the [Astera
      Institute specializes in frontier research and\\ntechnology projects (including
      on metascience) using Focused Research\\nOrganizations (FROs)](https://astera.org/fros){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      as an\\ninstrument to combine the two.\\n\\nOn this [site](https://ethereum.org/en/desci){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      we can\\nfind an (optimistic) overview of the ways in which DeSci could\\ncontribute
      to improve the scientific ecosystem:  \\n\\n| Decentralized Science                                                                                                 |
      Traditional Science                                                                                            |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n|
      1\\\\. Distribution of funds is determined by the public using mechanisms such
      as quadratic donations or DAOs.           | Small, closed, centralized groups
      control the distribution of funds.                                           |\\n|
      2\\\\. You collaborate with peers from all over the globe in dynamic teams.
      \                                             | Funding organizations and home
      institutions limit your collaborations.                                         |\\n|
      3\\\\. Funding decisions are made online and transparently. New funding mechanisms
      are explored.                         | Funding decisions are made with a long
      turnaround time and limited transparency. Few funding mechanisms exist. |\\n|
      4\\\\. Sharing laboratory services is made easier and more transparent using
      Web3 primitives.                            | Sharing laboratory resources is
      often slow and opaque.                                                         |\\n|
      5\\\\. New models for publishing can be developed that use Web3 primitives for
      trust, transparency and universal access. | You publish through established
      pathways frequently acknowledged as inefficient, biased and exploitative.      |\\n|
      6\\\\. You can earn tokens and reputation for peer-reviewing work.                                                       |
      Your peer-review work is unpaid, benefiting for-profit publishers.                                             |\\n|
      7\\\\. You own the intellectual property (IP) you generate and distribute it
      according to transparent terms.             | Your home institution owns the
      IP you generate. Access to the IP is not transparent.                           |\\n|
      8\\\\. Sharing all of the research, including the data from unsuccessful efforts,
      by having all steps on-chain.          | Publication bias means that researchers
      are more likely to share experiments that had successful results.      |\\n\\nWhile
      some arguments appear less convincing to me, or at least not\\nclearly benefitting
      from using blockchain technology (e.g., 2, 4, 7 or\\neven 8), others not only
      intervene on open challenges in the science\\necosystem, but also promise to
      leverage the strengths of blockchain\\ntechnology (e.g., 1, 3, 5 or 6). Personally,
      the areas where I see most\\npromise for DeSci include 1) developing open and
      distributed\\ninfrastructures to track and incentivize scientific outcomes (e.g.,\\nreviews
      and replications), 2) opening alternative sources of funding,\\nand 3) providing
      a playground to experiment with organization and\\nincentive design in science
      (e.g., including around publishing and\\nfunding).\\n\\nResearchHub, the organizer
      of SciCon 2022, is a decentralized autonomous\\norganization (DAO) attempting
      to combine all three of these aspects. Let\\nus take a closer look to further
      showcase how blockchain technology is\\nbeing used in DeSci.\\n\\n### A DeSci
      organization: ResearchHub\\n\\nResearchHub is a community effort to accelerate
      the pace of scientific\\nresearch by making its publication, review and discussion
      more open and\\ncollaborative. The Hub uses a crypto currency (Research Coin
      or RSC) to\\nincentivize participation. The portal currently supports a variety
      of\\nscience publishing activities including sharing, discussing and\\nreviewing
      articles, or even incentivizing activities via bounties, such\\nas answering
      a research question.\\n\\nA central feature of ResearchHub is the possibility
      to upload a research\\npaper (or pre-print) for further analysis, as in this\\n[example](https://www.researchhub.com/paper/1272956/a-through-intact-skull-tis-chronic-window-technique-for-cortical-structure-and-function-observation-in-mice){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/desci_figure2_2022-09-19-082514_hwfm.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Desci
      figure2\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nA paper can then be openly discussed, peer reviewed
      or summarized (like\\nin this case), via an interaction like Reddit's:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img
      src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/fig3.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Fig3\\\"
      />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### To know more\\n\\n[DeSci has so far developed with little
      input from the scientific\\ncommunity.](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-03642-9){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_While\\nthe
      movement is young and sensitive to the broader crypto market\\nsentiment, we
      can certainly use more experimentation in how we go about\\ndoing science. Often,
      it is easier and faster to think outside of the\\nestablished system. This means
      that, while many, if not most DeSci\\nprojects might not last, the movement
      has the potential to develop\\nout-of-the-box solutions to at least some of
      the considerable challenges\\ncurrently facing scientific research. To know
      more, the best way is to\\ncheck [this very comprehensive and up-to-date overview
      of DeSci\\ninitiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand,
      if any interests you, not hesitate to get involved. Another option\\nis to get

      "content_text": "We are witnessing a vertiginous global technological development,
      but\nthis development is not paralleled with a growing improvement in the\nsustainable
      development of the planet. For instance, next-generation\ncomputing, air transport,
      energy production, and more recently the\ndevelopment of 5G technologies, cryptocurrencies
      - among others -\nenhance human capacity in certain directions but limit it
      in others:\nthey increase our dependence on non-renewable sources and increase
      the\ninequalities between countries that provide such resources and countries\nthat
      develop these technologies. If we do not connect our technological\ndevelopment
      with global priorities -- such as the [UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals\n(SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/es/goals){target=\"_blank\"},
      how can we\npreserve the future of humans and other beings on the planet?\n\nIn
      [our\nstudy](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gj5kr/){target=\"_blank\"}, we\nevaluate
      the relationship between published engineering research and\nsustainable development
      and focus on two key points that are getting\nlittle attention:\u00a0\n\n- A
      large extent of AI\u00a0engineering research papers do not incorporate\n  sustainability
      goals in their reflections on the development of\n  technology.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-
      The extent to which countries have the ability to produce new\n  knowledge on
      AI, which we refer to as *AI engineering research\n  capabilities*, are being
      increasingly concentrated on powerful\n  countries, leaving the scientifically
      marginalized countries with\n  little room to define the directions of AI and
      assess the implications\n  of AI research.\n\nIn this blog post, we show\u00a0our
      findings that support these observations.\n\nOn the first point, given that
      technologies can be used in different\nways and that academia is one of the
      main engines for their development,\nit is necessary for academia to motivate
      critical thinking and reflect\non the potential uses of technologies. However,
      we found that\nsustainable development issues are little addressed in global\nengineering
      research, specifically in artificial intelligence We found\nthat it is not common
      to find researchers\\'' reflections on the impact of\ntheir inventions on the
      planet in AI publications, as well as their\npotential uses to achieve the SDGs
      by 2030. Out of 220,000 engineering\narticles indexed by IEEE Xplore on AI published
      from 2000 to 2020, only\n8% to 30% approximately -depending on the engineering
      discipline-\ndiscuss issues related to their contribution to sustainable development.\n\nThose
      disciplines that discuss sustainable development in more than 20%\nof their
      production focus on cognitive and cooperative systems,\nprediction methods,
      decision support systems, and computation theory.\nOther disciplines, such as
      learning systems, bio-inspired computing, and\nautonomous robots, which are
      crucial for sustainable development,\ndiscuss it to a much lesser extent (see
      figure 1).\u00a0\n\nWhile it can be argued that entrepreneurs and other parties
      will find\napplications of these technologies to sustainable development, scholars\nsuch
      as Yuval Noah-Harari have warned that [what drives the development\nof AI is
      not an ambition to solve our main societal issues, but rather\nincreasing profits
      and surveillance of the\npopulation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yuval-noah-harari-sapiens-60-minutes-2021-10-31).\nWe
      contend, then, that at a time of planetary crisis we need more\nawareness and
      commitment of engineers to help envision applications for\nsolving the major
      challenges of our time. Not engaging in the potential\nuses of technologies
      poses a risk of a disconnection between AI\nengineering research and these societal
      issues, leaving the development\nof these technologies to the forces of the
      market and state control.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/20220906_picture1_2022-09-07-112526_euda.png\"\nalt=\"20220906

      and\nArtificial Intelligence category in IEEE Xplore database that address\nSDGs,
      classified into Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks,\nComputational Intelligence,
      and Logic.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOn the second point, we found a disproportionate
      concentration of AI\nengineering research capabilities in a few dominant countries.
      This\nmeans that in terms of power, AI research follows the traditional\npattern
      of most technological developments, which is increasing the\nalready huge technological
      gap [between \"centers\" and\n\"peripheries](https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243909345834){target=\"_blank\"}\".\nThe
      following figure shows the global co-authorship patterns of AI\nengineering
      research, in which most countries involved are traditional\nscientific powers
      while the rest seem to play a very minor role.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/20220906_picture2.png\"\nalt=\"20220906

      centrality; only countries in the top 10 percentile by\nbetweenness centrality

      engineering research capabilities --\nthe extent to which countries can produce
      new knowledge - continues, how\ncan it be ensured that all countries have a
      voice and can act on the\ndevelopment of AI technologies? Additionally, to successfully
      regulate\nthese technologies, research capabilities are pivotal. Lacking such\ncapabilities
      means that potential regulations, such as limitations to\ndata collection, manipulation,
      and algorithm biases, may not be ensured\nbecause of a lack of infrastructure
      to reproduce research results and\ntechnologies, and a lack of local expertise
      to audit them.  \n\nA hopeful finding in our article is that sustainable development
      is\nincreasingly being discussed in certain AI-related engineering\ndisciplines.
      We identified *Broadcast technology*, *Systems Engineering\nand Theory*, *Ultrasonics,
      Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control*,\n*Sensors*, and *Education*. Specifically
      on AI subjects, we found\nemerging discussions of sustainable development in
      *Recurrent neural\nNetworks*, *Prediction Methods*, *Computation Theory*, *Learning\nSystems*,
      and *Machine learning*. We believe building on these emerging\ninterests can
      help to educate engineers that are more concerned with\ntheir natural and social
      environment.\u00a0\n\nHowever, to foster the relevance of AI research for sustainable\ndevelopment,
      capabilities need to be built in those countries that have\ntraditionally been
      marginalized. A decisive and generous approach to\ninternational collaboration
      and knowledge exchange needs to be supported\nand fostered by multilateral organizations
      such as the\n[OECD](https://www.oecd.org/about/){target=\"_blank\"} and the
      [United\nNations](https://www.un.org/en/){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0if contribution
      of AI\nresearch for sustainable development -leaving no one behind- is to be\nachieved.\u00a0\n\nGiven
      that power is in the hands of a few countries, coordinated\nprograms and funding
      in regions such as Latin America and South Saharan\nAfrica need to be developed
      and maintained over the long-term if these\nregions want to exert real influence
      on the global AI agenda, rather\nthan being mere subordinated consumers of AI.\n\n[Photo

      a thorough introduction to scientometrics. First, we defined\nscientometrics.
      We then discussed major scientometric data sources,\ntheir strengths and limitations,
      including Web of Science, Scopus, and\nDimensions as well as explored cutting
      edge tools available to\nscientometricians, including [Elsevier''s International
      Center for the\nStudy of Research Lab\n(ICSR)](https://www.elsevier.com/icsr/icsrlab){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[Dimensions on Google Big\nQuery](https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nWe
      learned how to construct and analyse a network using quantitative and\nscientometric
      methods based on scientometric data relationships, such as\ncausal inference,
      text analysis, and network analysis. We also had the\nopportunity to experience
      working with the VOSviewer software to gain an\nintuitive understanding of visualisation
      techniques.\n\nFurthermore, the summer school offered various alternative perspectives\non
      the study of science. We learned about altmetrics as indicators of\nscience-society
      interactions, about\u00a0the connections between Science and\nTechnology Studies
      (STS) and Scientometrics, and between\u00a0the Science of\nScience and the Sociology
      of Science. These perspectives on science are\nunlocking a new era of scientometric
      thinking, enriching our knowledge,\nand broadening our horizons. They also inspire
      us to think about our own\nresearch in new ways.\n\n### Student presentations\n\nTo
      conclude on the content part of the summer school, it would be\nrelevant to
      mention the student presentations. Due to our different\ndisciplinary backgrounds,
      we exchanged ideas on a wide variety of\nresearch topics, which had a very special
      significance for us in the\nsummer school. Among other topics, we talked about
      translational\npsychotherapy, the role of gender in solar energy research in
      Turkey,\npublic policies in Latin America, and public research\u00a0institutions
      in\nKorea. We talked about the terms \\\"ultrafine particles and\nnanoparticles\\\",
      and \\\"elderly independent living\\\" as well as broader\ntopics such as education
      policy during the COVID-19 pandemic and health\ndata sharing. Although we focussed
      mainly on scientometric methods,\nthere was no lack of diversity in the way
      to apply them: we looked at\ncitation behavior, talked about the development
      of new indicators, the\nrelationship between survey data and bibliographic data,
      and learned\nmore about grant proposals, delayed recognition in science, and
      the\nquantification of adjacent in distant reuse of references within\ndisciplines.\n\n###
      Global summer school: a hybrid experience\n\nThis edition of the CWTS Summer
      School was the first to offer a hybrid\nlearning experience, and like all first
      times, it brought a few\nchallenges. Still, the hybrid mode enriched diversity
      by including\nparticipants who otherwise could not have enjoyed the summer school.
      We\ncould classify the challenges into two main categories: unexpected\ncomical
      MS Teams happenings and issues related to technicalities. On the\ncomical side,
      we encountered unintentional unmuting and cat appearances,\nand on the technical
      side, we sometimes experienced poor connections and\nsound issues. However,
      all challenges were professionally managed by the\nteachers, not affecting the
      rhythm and pace of the summer school. One\non-site participant said: \\\"I found
      the hybrid format very enriching.\nGetting to know Leiden and the CWTS on site
      was great, but equally great\nwere the digital presentations and the enrichment
      of the discussions\nprovided by those connected online. Apart from the content
      of this\ncourse, networking and being able to exchange were the two\u00a0main\narguments
      for me to take part in the summer school - there was nothing\nelse to be desired.\"\n\nFrom
      the perspective of the online participants, the hybrid environment\nfelt like
      being in a movie; there were camera-shifting angles and\nzoom-in to participants
      speaking in person. Also, the teachers managed\nthe time for Q&A and discussion
      equally for all participants. In\nconclusion, although online participants were
      not in the room, their\nvaluable contributions showed the importance of bringing
      their voices\ninto this edition of the summer school.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/IMG_20220701_153030.jpg\"\nalt=\"IMG
      20220701 153030\" />\n</figure>\n\n### Impact beyond classroom\n\nThe summer
      school came just at the right time when most of the\nparticipants needed it.
      Indeed, it came at a point where most of us are\nworking on metric-related studies
      but needed a broader understanding and\nto\u00a0learn more about the distinctions
      between scientometrics,\nbibliometrics, and altmetrics. Discussions and clarifications
      on these\napproaches and on methods applied to diverse types of studies benefited\nmost
      participants. Participants who got the opportunity to present their\nwork-in-progress
      received comments from fellow participants which in\nreturn aided in improving
      their work.\n\nAccording to one participant: \"The summer school helped me to
      address\ncritical comments of reviewers regarding the \\''methodology\\'' section
      of\nan article about the impact of international collaboration on Namibian\nscience
      production\\\".\n\nAll the information on data sources and different tools used
      in\nscientometric studies provided during this course is a bonus that will\nenrich
      the future scientometric-related studies of all participants.\nAdditionally,
      free access to data sources such as the ICSR Lab and\nDimensions on Google Big
      Query will provide an opportunity for\nparticipants to use data for further
      exploration in metric-related\nstudies. Empowered by the knowledge gained at
      the summer school, we look\nforward to expanding the frontiers of scientometric
      research together in\nthe future.\n\n~Photo by\u00a0[Deleece\nCook](https://unsplash.com/@deleece){target=\"_blank\"}~\n",

      alternative perspectives\\non the study of science. We learned about altmetrics
      as indicators of\\nscience-society interactions, about\_the connections between
      Science and\\nTechnology Studies (STS) and Scientometrics, and between\_the
      Science of\\nScience and the Sociology of Science. These perspectives on science
      are\\nunlocking a new era of scientometric thinking, enriching our knowledge,\\nand
      broadening our horizons. They also inspire us to think about our own\\nresearch
      in new ways.\\n\\n### Student presentations\\n\\nTo conclude on the content
      part of the summer school, it would be\\nrelevant to mention the student presentations.
      Due to our different\\ndisciplinary backgrounds, we exchanged ideas on a wide
      variety of\\nresearch topics, which had a very special significance for us in
      the\\nsummer school. Among other topics, we talked about translational\\npsychotherapy,
      the role of gender in solar energy research in Turkey,\\npublic policies in
      Latin America, and public research\_institutions in\\nKorea. We talked about
      the terms \\\\\\\"ultrafine particles and\\nnanoparticles\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"elderly
      independent living\\\\\\\" as well as broader\\ntopics such as education policy
      during the COVID-19 pandemic and health\\ndata sharing. Although we focussed
      mainly on scientometric methods,\\nthere was no lack of diversity in the way
      to apply them: we looked at\\ncitation behavior, talked about the development
      of new indicators, the\\nrelationship between survey data and bibliographic
      data, and learned\\nmore about grant proposals, delayed recognition in science,
      and the\\nquantification of adjacent in distant reuse of references within\\ndisciplines.\\n\\n###
      Global summer school: a hybrid experience\\n\\nThis edition of the CWTS Summer
      School was the first to offer a hybrid\\nlearning experience, and like all first
      times, it brought a few\\nchallenges. Still, the hybrid mode enriched diversity
      by including\\nparticipants who otherwise could not have enjoyed the summer
      school. We\\ncould classify the challenges into two main categories: unexpected\\ncomical
      MS Teams happenings and issues related to technicalities. On the\\ncomical side,
      we encountered unintentional unmuting and cat appearances,\\nand on the technical
      side, we sometimes experienced poor connections and\\nsound issues. However,
      all challenges were professionally managed by the\\nteachers, not affecting
      the rhythm and pace of the summer school. One\\non-site participant said: \\\\\\\"I
      found the hybrid format very enriching.\\nGetting to know Leiden and the CWTS
      on site was great, but equally great\\nwere the digital presentations and the
      enrichment of the discussions\\nprovided by those connected online. Apart from
      the content of this\\ncourse, networking and being able to exchange were the
      two\_main\\narguments for me to take part in the summer school - there was nothing\\nelse
      to be desired.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the online participants, the
      hybrid environment\\nfelt like being in a movie; there were camera-shifting
      angles and\\nzoom-in to participants speaking in person. Also, the teachers
      managed\\nthe time for Q&A and discussion equally for all participants. In\\nconclusion,
      although online participants were not in the room, their\\nvaluable contributions
      showed the importance of bringing their voices\\ninto this edition of the summer
      school.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/IMG_20220701_153030.jpg\\\"\\nalt=\\\"IMG
      20220701 153030\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Impact beyond classroom\\n\\nThe
      summer school came just at the right time when most of the\\nparticipants needed
      it. Indeed, it came at a point where most of us are\\nworking on metric-related
      studies but needed a broader understanding and\\nto\_learn more about the distinctions
      between scientometrics,\\nbibliometrics, and altmetrics. Discussions and clarifications
      on these\\napproaches and on methods applied to diverse types of studies benefited\\nmost
      participants. Participants who got the opportunity to present their\\nwork-in-progress
      received comments from fellow participants which in\\nreturn aided in improving
      their work.\\n\\nAccording to one participant: \\\"The summer school helped
      me to address\\ncritical comments of reviewers regarding the \\\\'methodology\\\\'
      section of\\nan article about the impact of international collaboration on Namibian\\nscience
      production\\\\\\\".\\n\\nAll the information on data sources and different tools
      used in\\nscientometric studies provided during this course is a bonus that
      will\\nenrich the future scientometric-related studies of all participants.\\nAdditionally,
      free access to data sources such as the ICSR Lab and\\nDimensions on Google
      Big Query will provide an opportunity for\\nparticipants to use data for further
      exploration in metric-related\\nstudies. Empowered by the knowledge gained at
      the summer school, we look\\nforward to expanding the frontiers of scientometric
      research together in\\nthe future.\\n\\n~Photo by\_[Deleece\\nCook](https://unsplash.com/@deleece){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}~\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/unlocking-the-frontiers-of-scientometrics-cwts-summer-school-2022\",\"updated\":true,\"category\":\"socialSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      Excellence Project 5top100**\n\nThe [Russian Academic Excellence Project\n5top100](https://www.5top100.ru/en/){target=\"_blank\"}[](https://www.5top100.ru/en/)\nis
      a Russian excellence initiative in higher education that ran from\n2013 to 2020.
      The aim of the initiative was to place five Russian\nuniversities in the top
      100 of global university rankings. The goal was\nnot achieved; in political
      and academic discourses, there are\nconflicting assessments of the results of
      the project. On the one hand,\nthe main goal of the project was not achieved;
      no five project\nparticipants got into the top 100 of the most common global
      university\nrankings (here we mean ARWU, THE and QS rankings). On the other
      hand,\nthe Accounts Chamber (official auditor of the state budget) noted that\nthe
      implementation of the 5top100 project made it possible to form a\ngroup of leading
      universities in the country, as well as to integrate\nRussia into the global
      trends in the implementation of academic\nexcellence programs and strengthen
      the scale and significance of Russian\nuniversity science in the world. We tried
      to look at the problem from\ninside the university.\n\nThe Ural Federal University
      has been involved in the project from the\nvery beginning. The main mechanism
      for bringing public funding to the\nfinal recipients was the creation and development
      of research groups.\nThis scheme was typical for most of the participants of
      the 5top100\nproject. To the best of our knowledge, [our\nwork](https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economy/article/view/6069){target=\"_blank\"}\noffers
      the first study of the results of the implementation of the\nexcellence initiative
      not at the level of universities, but at the level\nof research units. This
      approach was made possible thanks to the\navailability of structured data for
      the period 2014-2020 provided by the\nDepartment of Strategic Development and
      Marketing.\n\n### **Key results**\n\nIn total, the analysis included performance
      indicators of 79 research\ngroups. The number of articles indexed in Scopus
      and Web of Science was\nused as the main indicator. As an alternative indicator
      of quality, we\nused the number of articles in journals with an impact factor
      above two.\nUnfortunately, disciplinary features were not taken into account
      in the\nprocess of research assessment, so the threshold was the same for all\ngroups.
      Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive relationship\nbetween the
      dynamics of these two indicators (0.56); thus, we refuted\nthe widely held assumption
      that stimulating quantitative growth of\npublications necessarily leads to a
      decrease in their quality. Our\nresults indirectly support the existence of
      [constant or increasing\nmarginal returns for most research\nareas](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166149){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThe
      amount of funding was set annually depending on the type of group\nand the performance
      for the previous period. The type of group (research\ngroup, research laboratory,
      center of excellence) was determined\ndepending on the number and level of group
      members. Paradoxically,\nfunding (current and previous) does not have a significant
      effect on the\nchange in research group productivity. Moreover, in some cases
      there was\nan inverse relationship. We can assume that in this case, prospective\nfunding
      plays a more significant role than current level of funding. For\nexample, a
      decrease in funding forces a group to work harder in the hope\nof increasing
      funding in the future. It is important to note that this\nvariable refers exclusively
      to government funding. In terms of R&D\nrevenue, we found an inverse relationship:
      the more R&D revenue, the\nsmaller the increase in the number of articles. Thus,
      we can state that\npublications and innovative activities (measured as R&D income
      in our\ncase) in research groups are substituting, not complementary.\n\nNo
      less surprising is the fact that the experience of the research\nleader of the
      group also has an inverse relationship with the increase\nin performance. This
      does not mean that groups with an experienced\nleader have poor results, quite
      the contrary. However, the results of\nsuch groups tend to be stable rather
      than growing.\n\nOur study showed that the main factor influencing research
      productivity\nis the size of the research group. The age of the project, defined
      as\nthe period of time from the establishment of a group to the termination\nof
      its operation, is also important. Note that we performed separate\nanalyses
      for social and humanities areas (15 of the 79 groups) and all\nothers. Interestingly,
      the age of the group has the greatest\nsignificance for both models in the social
      sciences and humanities\nfields with either the number of articles or articles
      in the journals\nwith IF \\> 2 as dependent variables. We attribute this to
      the fact that\nthere are fewer journals in these areas (purely humanities journals
      do\nnot have an impact factor in principle); respectively, it takes more\ntime
      to accumulate publications in top journals. Moreover, it simply\ntakes more
      time to publish anything in these fields compared to natural\nand technical
      sciences. Thus, we can conclude that social sciences and\nhumanities projects
      require a longer planning horizon so that one can\nsee the effects from funding.\n\nIn
      conclusion, our study found that:\n\n- The main factors affecting the performance
      of research teams are the\n  number of participants and the age of the project
      (the latter\n  especially for social sciences and humanities)\n- Funding (current
      and previous) has no impact on performance, although\n  it certainly affects
      the ability to hire more team members\n- Decrease in current funding can paradoxically
      increase productivity\n- Experienced researchers are more likely to create stable
      rather than\n  rapidly developing groups in terms of publication activity\n-
      Publication and R&D activities are at least partly substituting\n  towards each
      other\n\nThe study focused on one university, and the number of research groups\nis
      relatively small. Comparative analysis and expansion of the empirical\nbase
      will provide more meaningful results in the future. For example, it\nwill be
      interesting to compare the performance of research groups across\ndifferent
      disciplines in a larger sample.\u00a0Another limitation is that\nonly two databases
      (Scopus and Web of Science) were used in the\nevaluation procedure and in this
      study\u00a0as well. The results obtained are\nhighly dependent on the sources
      of bibliometric data. This study mainly\ncovered quantitative performance indicators
      but did not touch upon other\nproject outcomes such as increased academic mobility
      and foreign\nrecruitment.\n\n### **Concluding reflections**\n\nOur study showed
      that the 5top100 project empowered a dramatic increase\nin the number of publications
      by Russian scientists in international\ndatabases. This statement is true for
      both a particular university and\nthe country as a whole. Below is the statistics
      of publications for\n2013-2020 for the Ural Federal University, participants
      of the 5top100\nproject, and Russia.**  \n**\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure1_new_2022-08-06-092417_jctn.png\"\nalt=\"Figure1
      new\" />\n</figure>\n\nIn the end, I would like to return to where I started
      this post, i.e.,\nto the project 5top100. In my opinion, the Project failed
      to solve two\nmajor problems of Russian higher education. First, there remains
      a\nmonstrous gap between the budgets of the world\\''s leading universities\nand
      Russian universities. Universities should have a more balanced\nfunding structure
      with more private participation, for example in the\nform of revenue from R&D.
      It is impossible to solve this problem solely\nat the expense of public funds,
      and the demand for university research\nproducts (first of all, innovations)
      from the leading Russian companies\nis still at a consistently low level. The
      reality is that most of the\nscience-intensive products are purchased abroad,
      with the only exception\nfor the military complex. Secondly, the 5 top100 project
      did not lead to\ninstitutional changes within the universities and in the national
      higher\neducation system. All changes were implemented in the traditional rigid\nvertical
      with no real autonomy of universities (all project participants\nare state universities)
      and decentralization within universities. The\nquality of academic institutions,
      and first of all, academic freedom\ndetermines academic excellence, in my opinion.
      Therefore, it will be\ninteresting to observe not only the research performance
      issues under\nthe new [Priority 2030\nproject](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\"_blank\"},\nbut
      also how the new program will cope with these two challenges.\n\n*This text

      require a longer planning horizon so that one can\\nsee the effects from funding.\\n\\nIn
      conclusion, our study found that:\\n\\n- The main factors affecting the performance
      of research teams are the\\n  number of participants and the age of the project
      (the latter\\n  especially for social sciences and humanities)\\n- Funding (current
      and previous) has no impact on performance, although\\n  it certainly affects
      the ability to hire more team members\\n- Decrease in current funding can paradoxically
      increase productivity\\n- Experienced researchers are more likely to create
      stable rather than\\n  rapidly developing groups in terms of publication activity\\n-
      Publication and R&D activities are at least partly substituting\\n  towards
      each other\\n\\nThe study focused on one university, and the number of research
      groups\\nis relatively small. Comparative analysis and expansion of the empirical\\nbase
      will provide more meaningful results in the future. For example, it\\nwill be
      interesting to compare the performance of research groups across\\ndifferent
      disciplines in a larger sample.\_Another limitation is that\\nonly two databases
      (Scopus and Web of Science) were used in the\\nevaluation procedure and in this
      study\_as well. The results obtained are\\nhighly dependent on the sources of
      bibliometric data. This study mainly\\ncovered quantitative performance indicators
      but did not touch upon other\\nproject outcomes such as increased academic mobility
      and foreign\\nrecruitment.\\n\\n### **Concluding reflections**\\n\\nOur study
      showed that the 5top100 project empowered a dramatic increase\\nin the number
      of publications by Russian scientists in international\\ndatabases. This statement
      is true for both a particular university and\\nthe country as a whole. Below
      is the statistics of publications for\\n2013-2020 for the Ural Federal University,
      participants of the 5top100\\nproject, and Russia.**  \\n**\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure1_new_2022-08-06-092417_jctn.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Figure1
      new\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn the end, I would like to return to where I started
      this post, i.e.,\\nto the project 5top100. In my opinion, the Project failed
      to solve two\\nmajor problems of Russian higher education. First, there remains
      a\\nmonstrous gap between the budgets of the world\\\\'s leading universities\\nand
      Russian universities. Universities should have a more balanced\\nfunding structure
      with more private participation, for example in the\\nform of revenue from R&D.
      It is impossible to solve this problem solely\\nat the expense of public funds,
      and the demand for university research\\nproducts (first of all, innovations)
      from the leading Russian companies\\nis still at a consistently low level. The
      reality is that most of the\\nscience-intensive products are purchased abroad,
      with the only exception\\nfor the military complex. Secondly, the 5 top100 project
      did not lead to\\ninstitutional changes within the universities and in the national
      higher\\neducation system. All changes were implemented in the traditional rigid\\nvertical
      with no real autonomy of universities (all project participants\\nare state
      universities) and decentralization within universities. The\\nquality of academic
      institutions, and first of all, academic freedom\\ndetermines academic excellence,
      in my opinion. Therefore, it will be\\ninteresting to observe not only the research
      performance issues under\\nthe new [Priority 2030\\nproject](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/priority-2030-the-new-excellence-initiative-from-russia){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nbut
      also how the new program will cope with these two challenges.\\n\\n*This text

      **Background: Russian Academic Excellence Project 5top100**\\n\\nThe [Russian
      Academic Excellence Project\\n5top100](https://www.5top100.ru/en/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}[](https://www.5top100.ru/en/)\\nis
      a Russian excellence initiative in higher education that ran from\\n2013 to
      2020. The aim of the initiative was to place five Russian\\nuniversities in
      the top 100 of global university rankings. The goal was\\nnot achieved; in political
      and academic discourses, there are\\nconflicting assessments of the results
      of the project. On the one hand,\\nthe main goal of the project was not achieved;
      no five project\\nparticipants got into the top 100 of the most common global
      university\\nrankings (here we mean ARWU, THE and QS rankings). On the other
      hand,\\nthe Accounts Chamber (official auditor of the state budget) noted that\\nthe
      implementation of the 5top100 project made it possible to form a\\ngroup of
      leading universities in the country, as well as to integrate\\nRussia into the
      global trends in the implementation of academic\\nexcellence programs and strengthen
      the scale and significance of Russian\\nuniversity science in the world. We
      tried to look at the problem from\\ninside the university.\\n\\nThe Ural Federal
      University has been involved in the project from the\\nvery beginning. The main
      mechanism for bringing public funding to the\\nfinal recipients was the creation
      and development of research groups.\\nThis scheme was typical for most of the
      participants of the 5top100\\nproject. To the best of our knowledge, [our\\nwork](https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economy/article/view/6069){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\noffers
      the first study of the results of the implementation of the\\nexcellence initiative
      not at the level of universities, but at the level\\nof research units. This
      approach was made possible thanks to the\\navailability of structured data for
      the period 2014-2020 provided by the\\nDepartment of Strategic Development and
      Marketing.\\n\\n### **Key results**\\n\\nIn total, the analysis included performance
      indicators of 79 research\\ngroups. The number of articles indexed in Scopus
      and Web of Science was\\nused as the main indicator. As an alternative indicator
      of quality, we\\nused the number of articles in journals with an impact factor
      above two.\\nUnfortunately, disciplinary features were not taken into account
      in the\\nprocess of research assessment, so the threshold was the same for all\\ngroups.
      Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive relationship\\nbetween the
      dynamics of these two indicators (0.56); thus, we refuted\\nthe widely held
      assumption that stimulating quantitative growth of\\npublications necessarily
      leads to a decrease in their quality. Our\\nresults indirectly support the existence
      of [constant or increasing\\nmarginal returns for most research\\nareas](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166149){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
      amount of funding was set annually depending on the type of group\\nand the
      performance for the previous period. The type of group (research\\ngroup, research
      laboratory, center of excellence) was determined\\ndepending on the number and
      level of group members. Paradoxically,\\nfunding (current and previous) does
      not have a significant effect on the\\nchange in research group productivity.
      Moreover, in some cases there was\\nan inverse relationship. We can assume that
      in this case, prospective\\nfunding plays a more significant role than current
      level of funding. For\\nexample, a decrease in funding forces a group to work
      harder in the hope\\nof increasing funding in the future. It is important to
      note that this\\nvariable refers exclusively to government funding. In terms
      of R&D\\nrevenue, we found an inverse relationship: the more R&D revenue, the\\nsmaller
      the increase in the number of articles. Thus, we can state that\\npublications
      and innovative activities (measured as R&D income in our\\ncase) in research
      groups are substituting, not complementary.\\n\\nNo less surprising is the fact
      that the experience of the research\\nleader of the group also has an inverse
      relationship with the increase\\nin performance. This does not mean that groups
      with an experienced\\nleader have poor results, quite the contrary. However,
      the results of\\nsuch groups tend to be stable rather than growing.\\n\\nOur
      study showed that the main factor influencing research productivity\\nis the
      size of the research group. The age of the project, defined as\\nthe period
      of time from the establishment of a group to the termination\\nof its operation,
      is also important. Note that we performed separate\\nanalyses for social and
      humanities areas (15 of the 79 groups) and all\\nothers. Interestingly, the
      age of the group has the greatest\\nsignificance for both models in the social
      sciences and humanities\\nfields with either the number of articles or articles
      in the journals\\nwith IF \\\\> 2 as dependent variables. We attribute this
      to the fact that\\nthere are fewer journals in these areas (purely humanities
      journals do\\nnot have an impact factor in principle); respectively, it takes
      more\\ntime to accumulate publications in top journals. Moreover, it simply\\ntakes
      more time to publish anything in these fields compared to natural\\nand technical
      sciences. Thus, we can conclude that social sciences and\\nhumanities projects
      require a longer planning horizon so that one can\\nsee the effects from funding.\\n\\nIn
      conclusion, our study found that:\\n\\n- The main factors affecting the performance

      the European Union gave the green light\nfor a European Agreement on research
      assessment\nreforms](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/10/council-provides-political-orientations-on-international-cooperation-open-science-and-european-missions/){target=\"_blank\"}\nto
      go ahead. Plans for this initiative were proposed in a [European\nCommission
      scoping report in\n2021](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/36ebb96c-50c5-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1/language-en){target=\"_blank\"}.\nUnder
      the Agreement, research actors across European member states\n(including research
      performing organizations, funders, and national or\nregional assessment organizations)
      will be invited to sign up\nvoluntarily and pledge their commitment to translate
      principles outlined\nin the report into local assessment reforms.\n\nThe initiative
      builds on ten years or more of campaigns movements to\ncurb the misappropriation
      of research metrics in academic research\nassessment contexts, to broaden quality
      criteria and to change research\nculture more broadly. The fact that such an
      influential actor as the\nEuropean Commission has taken up the research assessment
      reform baton\nsuggests this agenda truly has landed, at least in certain policy
      spaces\n(see also recent reform efforts being coordinated within the\nNetherlands,
      Finland, and Norway) (P\u00f6l\u00f6nen and Mustajoki\n2022).^[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1){#footnote-1-ref}^\n\nFollowing
      the decision to press ahead with the Agreement, I would like\nto reflect on
      the strategy the European Commission appears to be\nadopting for facilitating
      such reforms, and consider some of the\nopportunities and challenges their approach
      may encounter. Before doing\nso, I briefly outline what principles the European
      Commission considers\nto be central to more responsible and fair modes of research
      assessment.\n\nThe European Commission''s scoping report laments the current
      state of\nresearch assessment in Europe, which it states is driven by races
      for\npublications and citations, at the expense of quality, and which leads\nto
      a publish or perish culture that is damaging for research and\nresearchers.
      The optimum method for research assessment is said to be\nqualitative peer review,
      and while the report adopts a critical tone\ntowards uses of research metrics
      in research assessment - it does not\ncompletely reject their use as long as
      they are used appropriately in\nsupporting (not replacing) qualitative decision
      making (citing, for\nexample, the [Leiden\nManifesto](http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/){target=\"_blank\"}).
      By\nsigning the Agreement, research actors are effectively committing to\nensure
      that their research assessments will:\n\n- recognize and reward the plurality
      of contributions researchers make\n  to academic life (not just publishing and
      bringing in grant money)\n- respect epistemic differences between research fields\n-
      reward new (or newly emphasized) quality dimensions such as open\n  science
      (broadly defined), research integrity, and societal relevance,\n  when evaluating
      individuals, institutions and research proposals.\n\nAs with the majority of
      efforts to initiate reforms of research\nassessment over the past decade, the
      European Commission Agreement is an\nexample of ''soft governance'', with the
      emphasis on steering from a\ndistance rather than hierarchical imposition. The
      scoping report avoids\ngiving precise prescriptions on how to implement reforms
      -- rather it\nprovides a broad vision and signposting to researchers and research\norganizations
      on how and why they should seek to redefine research\nquality, arguing that
      adhering to such values is commensurate with\nbetter (or more responsible) ''academic
      citizenship''. To reiterate,\nsigning the Agreement will be voluntary and *not*
      a legally binding\ncommitment: while there may be reputational fallout if a
      signatory were\nto be seen as not acting within the spirit of the Agreement,
      there are\nunlikely to be formal sanctions.\n\n### How far can ''soft governance''
      take research assessment reform efforts?  {#how-far-can-soft-governance-take-research-assessment-reform-efforts}\n\nA
      ''soft governance'' approach like the Agreement has its attractions for\ndifferent
      actors across the\u00a0European research landscape: in a period of\nrestricted
      economic growth and belt tightening around public funding,\nthe Agreement requires
      little fresh money from the Commission, with\nindividual signatories expected
      to self-fund their internal changes. The\nfact an actor like the Commission
      has so visibly put their weight behind\nthis agenda will no doubt help local
      change agents when lobbying for\ntheir own research organizations to revisit
      current assessment\npractices. Likewise the lack of top-down prescriptiveness
      about what\nexactly the reforms should look like affords agency and flexibility
      to\nthose on-the-ground in universities, funding bodies or assessment\nagencies
      to enact changes in a ''bottom up'' way. On the flipside, one can\nenvision
      potential limitations to this soft governance approach: lack of\nnew, centralized
      funding means universities and other research actors\nmay not wish (or be able)
      to invest their own scarce resources in\nenacting this agenda. Furthermore,
      the voluntary ''opt in'' nature of the\nchanges may well mean they can be easily
      ignored by those for whom the\nshared visions for change do not resonate. Soft
      governance mechanisms\nlike voluntary agreements ultimately rely on their intended
      audience\ngetting excited about the vision being set out or feeling a social\npressure
      to conform, but if big players are seen as ignoring these\ncalls, or organizations
      see them as too difficult to achieve, then the\nreforms will likely only be
      taken up sporadically by a handful of\nenthusiasts.\n\nAnother concern mentioned
      in the scoping report is the risk that\nresearch system actors in some member
      states will adopt reforms much\nquicker or enthusiastically than others, thus

      which envisions a\nsingle borderless market for research and for researchers.
      At national\nand local levels, influential actors with potential wrecking power
      may\npresent opposition to the reforms. We have already seen criticisms being\nvoiced
      against the Agreement from national research actors, for example\nin Germany,

      and counter-reform movements are challenges for which\nchampions of European
      research assessment reform should prepare\nthemselves.\n\nAs such, there could
      well be a bumpy road ahead towards reformed\nresearch assessment practices becoming
      mainstream across the European\nUnion. In Leiden, the need to make sense of
      assessment reform\ndevelopments in Europe and beyond has prompted us to establish

      the decision to press ahead with the Agreement, I would like\\nto reflect on
      the strategy the European Commission appears to be\\nadopting for facilitating
      such reforms, and consider some of the\\nopportunities and challenges their
      approach may encounter. Before doing\\nso, I briefly outline what principles
      the European Commission considers\\nto be central to more responsible and fair
      modes of research assessment.\\n\\nThe European Commission's scoping report
      laments the current state of\\nresearch assessment in Europe, which it states
      is driven by races for\\npublications and citations, at the expense of quality,
      and which leads\\nto a publish or perish culture that is damaging for research
      and\\nresearchers. The optimum method for research assessment is said to be\\nqualitative
      peer review, and while the report adopts a critical tone\\ntowards uses of research
      metrics in research assessment - it does not\\ncompletely reject their use as
      long as they are used appropriately in\\nsupporting (not replacing) qualitative
      decision making (citing, for\\nexample, the [Leiden\\nManifesto](http://www.leidenmanifesto.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).
      By\\nsigning the Agreement, research actors are effectively committing to\\nensure
      that their research assessments will:\\n\\n- recognize and reward the plurality
      of contributions researchers make\\n  to academic life (not just publishing
      and bringing in grant money)\\n- respect epistemic differences between research
      fields\\n- reward new (or newly emphasized) quality dimensions such as open\\n
      \ science (broadly defined), research integrity, and societal relevance,\\n
      \ when evaluating individuals, institutions and research proposals.\\n\\nAs
      with the majority of efforts to initiate reforms of research\\nassessment over
      the past decade, the European Commission Agreement is an\\nexample of 'soft
      governance', with the emphasis on steering from a\\ndistance rather than hierarchical
      imposition. The scoping report avoids\\ngiving precise prescriptions on how
      to implement reforms -- rather it\\nprovides a broad vision and signposting
      to researchers and research\\norganizations on how and why they should seek
      to redefine research\\nquality, arguing that adhering to such values is commensurate
      with\\nbetter (or more responsible) 'academic citizenship'. To reiterate,\\nsigning
      the Agreement will be voluntary and *not* a legally binding\\ncommitment: while
      there may be reputational fallout if a signatory were\\nto be seen as not acting
      within the spirit of the Agreement, there are\\nunlikely to be formal sanctions.\\n\\n###
      How far can 'soft governance' take research assessment reform efforts?  {#how-far-can-soft-governance-take-research-assessment-reform-efforts}\\n\\nA
      'soft governance' approach like the Agreement has its attractions for\\ndifferent
      actors across the\_European research landscape: in a period of\\nrestricted
      economic growth and belt tightening around public funding,\\nthe Agreement requires
      little fresh money from the Commission, with\\nindividual signatories expected
      to self-fund their internal changes. The\\nfact an actor like the Commission
      has so visibly put their weight behind\\nthis agenda will no doubt help local
      change agents when lobbying for\\ntheir own research organizations to revisit
      current assessment\\npractices. Likewise the lack of top-down prescriptiveness
      about what\\nexactly the reforms should look like affords agency and flexibility
      to\\nthose on-the-ground in universities, funding bodies or assessment\\nagencies
      to enact changes in a 'bottom up' way. On the flipside, one can\\nenvision potential
      limitations to this soft governance approach: lack of\\nnew, centralized funding
      means universities and other research actors\\nmay not wish (or be able) to
      invest their own scarce resources in\\nenacting this agenda. Furthermore, the
      voluntary 'opt in' nature of the\\nchanges may well mean they can be easily
      ignored by those for whom the\\nshared visions for change do not resonate. Soft
      governance mechanisms\\nlike voluntary agreements ultimately rely on their intended

      **Open peer review - Journal articles**  {#open-peer-review---journal-articles}\n\nTwo
      years ago, [Dietmar Wolfram and\ncolleagues](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03488-4){target=\"_blank\"}\nrevealed
      a strong growth in recent years in the number of journals\nsupporting some form
      of open peer review. Over 600 journals offered open\npeer review in 2019. These
      journals published the reports of reviewers,\nthe identities of reviewers, or
      both.  \n\nFigure 1 shows a similar growth in the number of peer review records
      in\nCrossref that are linked to a journal article. This number increased\nfrom
      fewer than 10,000 in 2018 to more than 60,000 in 2020 and 2021.\nEach of these
      peer review records represents a review report of a\nreviewer, a decision letter
      of an editor, or a response letter of an\nauthor. Many journal articles\u00a0are
      linked to multiple peer review records\nin Crossref. In 2021, over 13,000 journal
      articles had a link to one or\nmore peer review records.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      to journal articles published by Wiley. Indeed, Wiley\nhas made a [considerable\neffort](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.160026642.27642568/v2){target=\"_blank\"}\nto
      promote open peer review (referred to as transparent peer review by\nWiley).
      Other important contributors of peer review records in Crossref\nare PeerJ and
      eLife.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Crossref linked to a journal article:\nBreakdown by platform (left); Breakdown
      by publisher for Publons peer\nreview records (right).  \n]{.caption dir=\"ltr\"}\n\n  \nImportantly,
      there are several publishers that publish review reports\nbut don''t register
      a Crossref DOI for these reports. This is for\ninstance the case for BMJ, EMBO,
      MDPI, PLOS, and Springer Nature. There\nis no straightforward way to determine
      the number of review reports\npublished by these publishers, although some figures
      can be obtained\nfrom information provided by the publishers. MDPI for instance
      reports\nthat in 2020 it published review reports for [over 34,000\narticles](https://www.mdpi.com/anniversary25/blog/open-peer-review){target=\"_blank\"}.\nRecent
      statistics for PLOS show that PLOS published review reports for\n[more than
      7,500 articles in\n2021](https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFor
      Springer Nature recent statistics don''t seem to be available, but\nthe journal
      *Nature* reports to have published review reports [for\nalmost 450 articles
      in\n2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00493-w){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWhile
      precise figures aren''t available, it is clear that the total\nnumber of articles
      in 2021 for which review reports were published\nwithout a DOI is much larger
      than the 13,000 articles for which review\nreports were published with a DOI.
      Hence, a large majority of the\npublished review reports don''t have a persistent
      identifier and don''t\nhave openly available metadata. This severely limits
      the value of these\nreports.  \n\nOpen peer review may refer not only to publication
      of review reports,\nbut also to publication of identities of reviewers. The
      pros and cons of\ndisclosing reviewer identities have been [discussed\nextensively](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/21/open-reviewer-identities-full-steam-ahead-or-proceed-with-caution/){target=\"_blank\"}.\nFor
      peer review records in Crossref classified as review report (instead\nof decision
      letter or author response), we found that the identity of\nthe reviewer is disclosed
      in 39% of the cases.  \n\n### **Open peer review - Preprints**\n\nA recent development
      is the publication of review reports for preprints\ninstead of journal articles.
      A [variety of platforms and\ninitiatives](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8zj9w)
      offer a range of\ndifferent approaches to peer review of preprints.\n\nFigure
      3 shows the growth in the number of preprint peer review records\nin Crossref.
      While the number of records is much smaller than for\njournal articles, the
      growth is impressive, from 20 records in 2019 to\n733 records in 2021. Three
      platforms,\n[Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/){target=\"_blank\"}, [MIT Press Rapid\nReviews\nCOVID-19](https://rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/){target=\"_blank\"},\naccount for
      almost all preprint peer review records in Crossref. A small\nnumber of records
      originate from [Publons](https://publons.com/), and a\nfew records represent
      [review reports published by one of\nus](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/making-my-peer-review-activity-more-useful){target=\"_blank\"}\nusing
      the [PubPub\nplatform](https://help.pubpub.org/pub/preprints-toolkit/release/4){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-3.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:
      1;\" data-image=\"24175\" />\n</figure>\n\n[Figure 3. Peer review records in
      Crossref linked to a preprint: Growth\nin the number of records (left); Breakdown
      by platform (right).  \n]{.caption dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nMany review reports for preprints
      don''t have a Crossref DOI. These\nreports aren''t included in the statistics
      presented in Figure 3. This is\nfor instance the case for review reports from\n[PREreview](https://prereview.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      a platform for\npreprint peer review that uses DOIs from DataCite instead of
      Crossref.\nPREreview currently contains more than 250 review reports (excluding\nso-called
      rapid reviews). Other review reports for preprints don''t have\na DOI at all.
      This applies both to review reports published directly on\na preprint server
      and to review reports published on various preprint\npeer review platforms.
      The latter reports may be visible in\n[Sciety](https://sciety.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      a platform that\naggregates review reports and other evaluations of preprints
      from a\nvariety of sources.  \n\n### **Open peer review - Copernicus and F1000**\n\nCopernicus
      and F1000 are special cases. Copernicus offers an [integrated\nplatform](https://publications.copernicus.org/services/public_peer_review.html){target=\"_blank\"}\nthat
      publishes both journal articles and preprints as well as the\nassociated review
      reports. Likewise, F1000 provides a platform that\npublishes multiple versions
      of an article, including the review reports\nfor each version. Because of their
      special nature, we present statistics\nfor Copernicus and F1000 separately from
      the statistics reported above.\nPeer review records for Copernicus and F1000
      aren''t included in Figures\n1, 2, and 3.\n\nFigure 4 shows the growth in the
      number of peer review records for\nCopernicus and F1000. The statistics for
      F1000 were obtained from\nDataCite instead of Crossref, because F1000 uses DataCite
      to register\nDOIs for review reports. Copernicus is a major contributor of peer\nreview
      records in Crossref, especially in earlier years. F1000 is a\npioneer in registering
      DOIs for review reports, starting in 2012. The\nnumber of peer review records
      for F1000 is much smaller than for\nCopernicus, but it has shown a steady growth
      over the past decade.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-4.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      peer review records in Crossref for\njournal articles and preprints published
      by Copernicus (left) and in the\nnumber of peer review records in DataCite for
      articles published by\nF1000 (right).]{.caption}\n\n### **Recommendations**  {#recommendations}\n\nThe
      statistics presented in this blog post show an impressive growth in\nthe adoption
      of open peer review, especially in recent years.\nNevertheless, the [transition
      advocated twenty years ago by Fiona\nGodlee](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762){target=\"_blank\"},
      from\nthe \"flawed system of closed prepublication peer review\" to a system
      of\n\"preprint servers combined with open commentary\", is still in a very\nearly
      stage, with preprint peer review starting to take off only very\nrecently.  \n\nWe
      see improvement of peer review as a joint responsibility of all\nstakeholders
      involved. Each stakeholder needs to make a contribution. We\nrecommend that:\n\n-
      **Authors and reviewers** explore the interesting new opportunities\n  offered
      by preprint peer review platforms.\n\n- **Scientific publishers and preprint
      peer review platforms**[register\n  DOIs for open review\n  reports](https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/){target=\"_blank\"}\n  and
      include links in the metadata of these reports to the\n  corresponding journal
      articles and preprints.\n\n- **Bibliographic databases** provide data not only
      for journal\n  articles, but also for preprints and for open review reports
      linked to\n  journal articles and preprints.\n\n- **Research funders and institutions**
      consider using this data in\n  research assessments in order to [give appropriate\n  recognition](https://www.coalition-s.org/statement-on-peer-reviewed-publications/){target=\"_blank\"}\n  to
      the work done by authors and reviewers.\n\nWe end this post by drawing special
      attention to an opportunity\nindividual researchers have to contribute to the
      growth of open peer\nreview. The [Publish Your Reviews\ninitiative](http://publishyourreviews.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      launched\ntoday by [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/){target=\"_blank\"} (and\nco-organized
      by one of us), calls on researchers to publish their review\nreports alongside
      the preprint version of an article. This offers an\neasy way to promote openness
      in peer review. Researchers are invited to\nexpress their support for the initiative
      by [signing a\npledge](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews#sign){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n[[*This

      \ {#recommendations}\\n\\nThe statistics presented in this blog post show an
      impressive growth in\\nthe adoption of open peer review, especially in recent
      years.\\nNevertheless, the [transition advocated twenty years ago by Fiona\\nGodlee](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      from\\nthe \\\"flawed system of closed prepublication peer review\\\" to a system
      of\\n\\\"preprint servers combined with open commentary\\\", is still in a very\\nearly
      stage, with preprint peer review starting to take off only very\\nrecently.
      \ \\n\\nWe see improvement of peer review as a joint responsibility of all\\nstakeholders
      involved. Each stakeholder needs to make a contribution. We\\nrecommend that:\\n\\n-
      **Authors and reviewers** explore the interesting new opportunities\\n  offered
      by preprint peer review platforms.\\n\\n- **Scientific publishers and preprint
      peer review platforms**[register\\n  DOIs for open review\\n  reports](https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ and include links in the metadata of these reports to the\\n  corresponding
      journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Bibliographic databases** provide data
      not only for journal\\n  articles, but also for preprints and for open review
      reports linked to\\n  journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Research funders
      and institutions** consider using this data in\\n  research assessments in order
      to [give appropriate\\n  recognition](https://www.coalition-s.org/statement-on-peer-reviewed-publications/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ to the work done by authors and reviewers.\\n\\nWe end this post by drawing
      special attention to an opportunity\\nindividual researchers have to contribute
      to the growth of open peer\\nreview. The [Publish Your Reviews\\ninitiative](http://publishyourreviews.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      launched\\ntoday by [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} (and\\nco-organized
      by one of us), calls on researchers to publish their review\\nreports alongside
      the preprint version of an article. This offers an\\neasy way to promote openness
      in peer review. Researchers are invited to\\nexpress their support for the initiative
      by [signing a\\npledge](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews#sign){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      a strong growth in recent years in the number of journals\\nsupporting some
      form of open peer review. Over 600 journals offered open\\npeer review in 2019.
      These journals published the reports of reviewers,\\nthe identities of reviewers,
      or both.  \\n\\nFigure 1 shows a similar growth in the number of peer review
      records in\\nCrossref that are linked to a journal article. This number increased\\nfrom

      peer review records represents a review report of a\\nreviewer, a decision letter
      of an editor, or a response letter of an\\nauthor. Many journal articles\_are
      linked to multiple peer review records\\nin Crossref. In 2021, over 13,000 journal
      articles had a link to one or\\nmore peer review records.  \\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/the-growth-of-open-peer-review-image-1.png\\\"\\nstyle=\\\"opacity:

      \ {#recommendations}\\n\\nThe statistics presented in this blog post show an
      impressive growth in\\nthe adoption of open peer review, especially in recent
      years.\\nNevertheless, the [transition advocated twenty years ago by Fiona\\nGodlee](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      from\\nthe \\\"flawed system of closed prepublication peer review\\\" to a system
      of\\n\\\"preprint servers combined with open commentary\\\", is still in a very\\nearly
      stage, with preprint peer review starting to take off only very\\nrecently.
      \ \\n\\nWe see improvement of peer review as a joint responsibility of all\\nstakeholders
      involved. Each stakeholder needs to make a contribution. We\\nrecommend that:\\n\\n-
      **Authors and reviewers** explore the interesting new opportunities\\n  offered
      by preprint peer review platforms.\\n\\n- **Scientific publishers and preprint
      peer review platforms**[register\\n  DOIs for open review\\n  reports](https://www.crossref.org/blog/peer-reviews-are-open-for-registering-at-crossref/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ and include links in the metadata of these reports to the\\n  corresponding
      journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Bibliographic databases** provide data
      not only for journal\\n  articles, but also for preprints and for open review
      reports linked to\\n  journal articles and preprints.\\n\\n- **Research funders
      and institutions** consider using this data in\\n  research assessments in order
      to [give appropriate\\n  recognition](https://www.coalition-s.org/statement-on-peer-reviewed-publications/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n
      \ to the work done by authors and reviewers.\\n\\nWe end this post by drawing
      special attention to an opportunity\\nindividual researchers have to contribute
      to the growth of open peer\\nreview. The [Publish Your Reviews\\ninitiative](http://publishyourreviews.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      launched\\ntoday by [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} (and\\nco-organized
      by one of us), calls on researchers to publish their review\\nreports alongside
      the preprint version of an article. This offers an\\neasy way to promote openness
      in peer review. Researchers are invited to\\nexpress their support for the initiative
      by [signing a\\npledge](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews#sign){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      other countries in Europe and around the\nworld, was in the midst of the first
      wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLockdown measures were in place in the entire
      country in the attempt to\nlimit the spread of the virus. In these hard times,
      Italian public\nopinion was exposed to hitherto specialistic notions of epidemiology\nsuch
      as exponential growth, basic reproduction number, respiratory\ndroplets and
      so on. Experts from medicine and other scientific fields\nhad rapidly acquired
      a new centrality in the media and in government. A\nscientific-technical committee
      was established to advise the government,\nwhile medical doctors and scientists
      were routinely interviewed in\nnewspapers and invited in talk shows.\n\nIn this
      context, on May 2 the newspaper *Il Tempo* published an\n[article](https://www.ilcorrieredelgiorno.it/gli-esperti-piu-scarsi-del-mondo-burioni-pregliasco-e-brusaferro/){target=\"_blank\"}\nbearing
      the title: \"The poorest experts in the world: Burioni,\nPregliasco and Brusaferro\".[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1){#footnote-1-ref}
      In this\narticle, the *scientific reliability* of several experts taking part
      in\nthe scientific-technical committee or appearing in the media was gauged\nusing
      the most (in)famous bibliometric indicator, the h-index. Experts\nwere ranked
      and licenses of expertise attributed or discarded based on\nh-index scores.
      The journalist explained:  \n\nThe frankly crude use of the h-index made in
      the article attracted much\ncriticism from the Italian scientific community
      (see\n[here](https://m.facebook.com/pattotrasversaleperlascienza/posts/2269510433344522){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0and\n[here](http://www.pellegrinoconte.com/2020/05/02/credibilita-scientifica-e-h-index/?fbclid=IwAR3dw1ir3aU2PkTl3Motnla2OgK09OejtRxSZ779Uxe5g3Phd8yT7N-7Da0){target=\"_blank\"},\nsources
      in Italian). On my part, I was deeply impressed by how a\nspecialized notion
      from bibliometrics *percolated* in the generalist\npress and was *mobilized*
      in public debates on scientific authority and\ntrustworthiness of experts. I
      was aware that bibliometricians and\nscholars in STS were increasingly revealing
      the performative nature of\nbibliometric indicators: far from being neutral
      measures, these\nstatistical constructs [shape the behavior of\nscientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221212){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      deeply [intrude into the epistemic structure of the sciences\nthemselves](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Franssen/publication/288856380_Evaluation_practices_and_effects_of_indicator_use-a_literature_review/links/5796397508aeb0ffcd058786/Evaluation-practices-and-effects-of-indicator-use-a-literature-review.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nHowever,
      this kind of research had so far mainly focused on\nintra-scientific contexts
      and practices, with little attention for\nextra-scientific arenas. Yet, the
      article mentioned above seemed to me a\nclear example of how academic/scientific
      actors are *notalone* in\ngenerating the *socialrepresentation* of bibliometric
      indicators: a\ncomplete description of the processes of negotiating meaning
      should\nencompass further actors, such as journalists, and further arenas, such\nas
      the press.\n\nI then started a research project aiming at investigating the\nrepresentations
      and uses of bibliometrics in the press, with the aim of\ndeveloping the [previous\nclassifications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2150-8){target=\"_blank\"}\nof
      relevant actors. I decided to focus on the Italian press for two\nreasons. First,
      Italy''s research evaluation system is heavily based on\nbibliometric indicators.
      This system was introduced in 2010 as part of a\nvast reform of the country''s
      university management, which was heavily\ncontested by the Italian academic
      community. Second, Italy lacks a\nstrong indigenous community of bibliometrics
      experts. In this sense, no\ncommunity could claim an *epistemic control* of
      the social discourse on\nbibliometrics in the country. These factors created
      the conditions for\nnewspapers to become a key arena for the discussion of bibliometrics
      and\nbibliometric indicators and, hence, a perfect viewpoint to observe the\ncollective
      construction of their social representation.\n\nUsing the online archives of
      four major Italian newspapers, I retrieved\na corpus of 583 articles, published
      between 1990 and 2020, that\nmentioned the Journal Impact Factor, the h-index,
      or other\nbibliometrics-related terms. In this blog post I cannot go into the\ndetails
      of this very rich material.[\\[2\\]](#footnote-2){#footnote-2-ref}\nI will try,
      however, to highlight what I deem to be the three most\ninteresting findings
      and suggest some ideas for further research.\n\n### Indicators in the press
      between meritocracy, science news, and rankings\n\nThe first result is that
      the Impact Factor (IF, in the following)\nstarted to appear in the Italian press
      in news about *scandals in\ncompetitions for university chairs*. In the early
      1990s, it become\ncommon practice to sum the IF of the journals in which scientists\npublished,
      obtaining an IF-based metric of individual researchers. In\nthis way, candidates
      rejected in competitions had at their disposal a\nnew, easily interpretable
      metric to compare their scientific performance\nwith that of the winners and,
      thus, could reclaim justice. In this\nsense, the IF started its career in the
      Italian press as a \"justice\ndevice\" to *promote meritocracy* in academic
      recruitment. The following\nquote is representative of the general tone of the
      news denouncing\nscandals:  \n\nThe rhetorical use of indicators as objective
      measures that can fix the\nperceived endemic clientelism of Italian academy
      grows over the years\nand reaches its highest intensity in the years before
      the implementation\nof the 2010 university reform (Figure 1).\n\n<figure>\n<img
      src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1.png\"\nalt=\"Fig
      1 petrovich\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 1 - Articles presenting bibliometric indicators
      as a\nmeans to promote meritocracy in the Italian university system. Figure\nadapted
      from the published article.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis shows that indicators
      were integrated into a *meritocracy-centered\nnarrative frame* long before they
      were officially enrolled in the\nItalian research evaluation system.\n\nThe
      second finding, which is particularly relevant for understanding how\nthe press
      contributes to the social construction of scientific facts, is\nthat the Impact
      Factor is frequently used by journalists as a \"quality\nseal\" for science
      news. The IF is presented as a warrant of the\n*scientific reliability* of the
      venue of publication, and hence, of the\ncredibility or relevance of the science
      news reported:  \n\nNote that no article where the IF plays this function mentions
      the\nlimitations of the indicator, that hence is presented as a completely\n\"transparent\"
      quality seal, easily interpretable and uncontested.\n\nInterestingly, the IF
      can be mobilized also to *deconstruct* the\nvalidity of research in the news.
      For instance, the reliability of a\nstudy allegedly showing the efficacy of
      homeopathy is contested based on\nthe IF factor of the publishing journal, observing
      that this was \"very\nlow\" compared to that of serious scientific journals
      such as *Nature*.\n\nThe third interesting result concerns the role of *amateur\nbibliometrics*
      in the press, that is bibliometrics produced by\nnonprofessional bibliometricians.
      The h-index arrives in the Italian\npress in 2008, just three years after its
      creation by Jorge Hirsch. The\n\"vector\" of the indicator was a ranking of
      Italian scientists known as\n\"Top Italian Scientists\" (TIS), [published online\nby](https://topitalianscientists.org/home){target=\"_blank\"}
      the\nassociation Virtual Italian Academy. In 2010 and 2011, most of the\narticles
      that mentioned the indicator were in fact about the TIS. This\nranking offered
      journalists a ranking of individual scientists that\nnicely complemented rankings
      of universities that started popping up in\nthe press in the same years. However,
      it was the result of a private\ninitiative without institutional support. Again,
      about one out of three\nof the news about the TIS ranking lack any definition
      of the indicator\nand less than the half report its limitations.\n\nThese three
      findings show that bibliometric indicators in the press\noccur in different
      contexts, play a wide range of functions, and are\nintegrated into different
      narrative frames. They appear in debates on\nacademic recruitment, but also
      in the communication of scientific\ndiscoveries to the public. They can be used
      to claim justice but also to\nsatisfy the hunger for rankings and measuring
      \"excellence\".\n\n### Next steps\n\nThe next, natural step in the investigation
      of bibliometrics in the\npress is to understand how the social meaning of indicators
      is\nconstructed in the press of other countries and in other media or press\ntypes.
      It has for instance been suggested to me that Dutch journalists\nrepresent the
      IF differently from their Italian colleagues, using it as\na \"shorthand\" for
      any bibliometric statistics. In this research, I\nanalyzed the generalist press,
      but there is also a specialist press,\nsuch as Times Higher Education, or specialist
      blogs, such as [Leiden\nMadtrics](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and [ROARS\n(Return on Academic\nResearch)](https://www.roars.it/online/who-we-are/){target=\"_blank\"},
      in\nwhich the representation of indicators may follow different logics.\nBibliometrics
      in press has still lots to tell.  \n\n[[\\[1\\]](#footnote-1-ref){#_ftn1} The

      that of the winners and, thus, could reclaim justice. In this\\nsense, the IF
      started its career in the Italian press as a \\\"justice\\ndevice\\\" to *promote
      meritocracy* in academic recruitment. The following\\nquote is representative
      of the general tone of the news denouncing\\nscandals:  \\n\\nThe rhetorical
      use of indicators as objective measures that can fix the\\nperceived endemic
      clientelism of Italian academy grows over the years\\nand reaches its highest
      intensity in the years before the implementation\\nof the 2010 university reform
      (Figure 1).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Fig
      1 petrovich\\\" />\\n<figcaption>Figure 1 - Articles presenting bibliometric
      indicators as a\\nmeans to promote meritocracy in the Italian university system.
      Figure\\nadapted from the published article.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThis
      shows that indicators were integrated into a *meritocracy-centered\\nnarrative
      frame* long before they were officially enrolled in the\\nItalian research evaluation
      system.\\n\\nThe second finding, which is particularly relevant for understanding
      how\\nthe press contributes to the social construction of scientific facts,
      is\\nthat the Impact Factor is frequently used by journalists as a \\\"quality\\nseal\\\"
      for science news. The IF is presented as a warrant of the\\n*scientific reliability*
      of the venue of publication, and hence, of the\\ncredibility or relevance of
      the science news reported:  \\n\\nNote that no article where the IF plays this
      function mentions the\\nlimitations of the indicator, that hence is presented
      as a completely\\n\\\"transparent\\\" quality seal, easily interpretable and
      uncontested.\\n\\nInterestingly, the IF can be mobilized also to *deconstruct*
      the\\nvalidity of research in the news. For instance, the reliability of a\\nstudy
      allegedly showing the efficacy of homeopathy is contested based on\\nthe IF
      factor of the publishing journal, observing that this was \\\"very\\nlow\\\"
      compared to that of serious scientific journals such as *Nature*.\\n\\nThe third
      interesting result concerns the role of *amateur\\nbibliometrics* in the press,
      that is bibliometrics produced by\\nnonprofessional bibliometricians. The h-index
      arrives in the Italian\\npress in 2008, just three years after its creation
      by Jorge Hirsch. The\\n\\\"vector\\\" of the indicator was a ranking of Italian
      scientists known as\\n\\\"Top Italian Scientists\\\" (TIS), [published online\\nby](https://topitalianscientists.org/home){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      the\\nassociation Virtual Italian Academy. In 2010 and 2011, most of the\\narticles
      that mentioned the indicator were in fact about the TIS. This\\nranking offered
      journalists a ranking of individual scientists that\\nnicely complemented rankings
      of universities that started popping up in\\nthe press in the same years. However,
      it was the result of a private\\ninitiative without institutional support. Again,
      about one out of three\\nof the news about the TIS ranking lack any definition
      of the indicator\\nand less than the half report its limitations.\\n\\nThese
      three findings show that bibliometric indicators in the press\\noccur in different
      contexts, play a wide range of functions, and are\\nintegrated into different
      narrative frames. They appear in debates on\\nacademic recruitment, but also
      in the communication of scientific\\ndiscoveries to the public. They can be
      used to claim justice but also to\\nsatisfy the hunger for rankings and measuring
      \\\"excellence\\\".\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nThe next, natural step in the investigation
      of bibliometrics in the\\npress is to understand how the social meaning of indicators
      is\\nconstructed in the press of other countries and in other media or press\\ntypes.
      It has for instance been suggested to me that Dutch journalists\\nrepresent
      the IF differently from their Italian colleagues, using it as\\na \\\"shorthand\\\"
      for any bibliometric statistics. In this research, I\\nanalyzed the generalist
      press, but there is also a specialist press,\\nsuch as Times Higher Education,
      or specialist blogs, such as [Leiden\\nMadtrics](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      and [ROARS\\n(Return on Academic\\nResearch)](https://www.roars.it/online/who-we-are/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      in\\nwhich the representation of indicators may follow different logics.\\nBibliometrics
      in press has still lots to tell.  \\n\\n[[\\\\[1\\\\]](#footnote-1-ref){#_ftn1}

      in the midst of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nLockdown measures
      were in place in the entire country in the attempt to\\nlimit the spread of
      the virus. In these hard times, Italian public\\nopinion was exposed to hitherto
      specialistic notions of epidemiology\\nsuch as exponential growth, basic reproduction
      number, respiratory\\ndroplets and so on. Experts from medicine and other scientific
      fields\\nhad rapidly acquired a new centrality in the media and in government.
      A\\nscientific-technical committee was established to advise the government,\\nwhile
      medical doctors and scientists were routinely interviewed in\\nnewspapers and
      invited in talk shows.\\n\\nIn this context, on May 2 the newspaper *Il Tempo*
      published an\\n[article](https://www.ilcorrieredelgiorno.it/gli-esperti-piu-scarsi-del-mondo-burioni-pregliasco-e-brusaferro/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbearing
      the title: \\\"The poorest experts in the world: Burioni,\\nPregliasco and Brusaferro\\\".[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftn1){#footnote-1-ref}
      In this\\narticle, the *scientific reliability* of several experts taking part
      in\\nthe scientific-technical committee or appearing in the media was gauged\\nusing
      the most (in)famous bibliometric indicator, the h-index. Experts\\nwere ranked
      and licenses of expertise attributed or discarded based on\\nh-index scores.
      The journalist explained:  \\n\\nThe frankly crude use of the h-index made in
      the article attracted much\\ncriticism from the Italian scientific community
      (see\\n[here](https://m.facebook.com/pattotrasversaleperlascienza/posts/2269510433344522){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and\\n[here](http://www.pellegrinoconte.com/2020/05/02/credibilita-scientifica-e-h-index/?fbclid=IwAR3dw1ir3aU2PkTl3Motnla2OgK09OejtRxSZ779Uxe5g3Phd8yT7N-7Da0){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nsources
      in Italian). On my part, I was deeply impressed by how a\\nspecialized notion
      from bibliometrics *percolated* in the generalist\\npress and was *mobilized*
      in public debates on scientific authority and\\ntrustworthiness of experts.
      I was aware that bibliometricians and\\nscholars in STS were increasingly revealing
      the performative nature of\\nbibliometric indicators: far from being neutral
      measures, these\\nstatistical constructs [shape the behavior of\\nscientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221212){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      deeply [intrude into the epistemic structure of the sciences\\nthemselves](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Franssen/publication/288856380_Evaluation_practices_and_effects_of_indicator_use-a_literature_review/links/5796397508aeb0ffcd058786/Evaluation-practices-and-effects-of-indicator-use-a-literature-review.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHowever,
      this kind of research had so far mainly focused on\\nintra-scientific contexts
      and practices, with little attention for\\nextra-scientific arenas. Yet, the
      article mentioned above seemed to me a\\nclear example of how academic/scientific
      actors are *notalone* in\\ngenerating the *socialrepresentation* of bibliometric
      indicators: a\\ncomplete description of the processes of negotiating meaning
      should\\nencompass further actors, such as journalists, and further arenas,
      such\\nas the press.\\n\\nI then started a research project aiming at investigating
      the\\nrepresentations and uses of bibliometrics in the press, with the aim of\\ndeveloping
      the [previous\\nclassifications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2150-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nof
      relevant actors. I decided to focus on the Italian press for two\\nreasons.
      First, Italy's research evaluation system is heavily based on\\nbibliometric
      indicators. This system was introduced in 2010 as part of a\\nvast reform of
      the country's university management, which was heavily\\ncontested by the Italian
      academic community. Second, Italy lacks a\\nstrong indigenous community of bibliometrics
      experts. In this sense, no\\ncommunity could claim an *epistemic control* of
      the social discourse on\\nbibliometrics in the country. These factors created
      the conditions for\\nnewspapers to become a key arena for the discussion of
      bibliometrics and\\nbibliometric indicators and, hence, a perfect viewpoint
      to observe the\\ncollective construction of their social representation.\\n\\nUsing
      the online archives of four major Italian newspapers, I retrieved\\na corpus
      of 583 articles, published between 1990 and 2020, that\\nmentioned the Journal
      Impact Factor, the h-index, or other\\nbibliometrics-related terms. In this
      blog post I cannot go into the\\ndetails of this very rich material.[\\\\[2\\\\]](#footnote-2){#footnote-2-ref}\\nI
      will try, however, to highlight what I deem to be the three most\\ninteresting
      findings and suggest some ideas for further research.\\n\\n### Indicators in
      the press between meritocracy, science news, and rankings\\n\\nThe first result
      is that the Impact Factor (IF, in the following)\\nstarted to appear in the
      Italian press in news about *scandals in\\ncompetitions for university chairs*.
      In the early 1990s, it become\\ncommon practice to sum the IF of the journals
      in which scientists\\npublished, obtaining an IF-based metric of individual
      researchers. In\\nthis way, candidates rejected in competitions had at their
      disposal a\\nnew, easily interpretable metric to compare their scientific performance\\nwith
      that of the winners and, thus, could reclaim justice. In this\\nsense, the IF
      started its career in the Italian press as a \\\"justice\\ndevice\\\" to *promote
      meritocracy* in academic recruitment. The following\\nquote is representative
      of the general tone of the news denouncing\\nscandals:  \\n\\nThe rhetorical
      use of indicators as objective measures that can fix the\\nperceived endemic
      clientelism of Italian academy grows over the years\\nand reaches its highest
      intensity in the years before the implementation\\nof the 2010 university reform
      (Figure 1).\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Figure_1.png\\\"\\nalt=\\\"Fig

      indicators as a\\nmeans to promote meritocracy in the Italian university system.

      shows that indicators were integrated into a *meritocracy-centered\\nnarrative
