        /><p>In this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open approach
        for classifying research publications, contributing to a broader development
        toward open approaches to bibliometrics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Classifying research
        publications into research topics or research areas is crucial for many bibliometric
        analyses. While there are lots of approaches for classifying publications,
        most of these approaches lack transparency. Although there are exceptions
        (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>
        and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>), these approaches are typically based on data
        from proprietary sources or they rely on non-transparent algorithms.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">We introduce an open approach to the algorithmic classification
        of research publications. This approach builds on a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1\"
        target=\"_blank\">methodology we developed more than a decade ago</a>. While
        this methodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary sources,
        we now apply it to open data from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>.
        We make available a fully open classification of publications. The research
        areas in this classification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
        the classification is presented visually using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
        target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online software</a>. We also release open source
        software that enables anyone to reproduce and extend our work.<br></p><h3>Building
        the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We built <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
        target=\"_blank\">our classification</a> based on OpenAlex data, using the
        <a href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\"
        target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a> released on November 21, 2023. Over the past
        years, our methodology has been used to create classifications based on Web
        of Science and Scopus data. These classifications are available in <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/\"
        target=\"_blank\">InCites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence\"
        target=\"_blank\">SciVal</a>, respectively. Compared to Web of Science and
        Scopus, OpenAlex has the benefit that its data is fully open and that it offers
        a broader coverage of the scholarly literature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To build
        our classification, we used the so-called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035\"
        target=\"_blank\">extended direct citation approach</a> in combination with
        the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
        algorithm</a>. The source code of the software we used is available <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our classification covers the 71 million journal
        articles, proceedings papers, preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that
        were published between 2000 and 2023 and that are connected to each other
        by citation links. Based on 1715 million citation links, we built a three-level
        hierarchical classification. Each publication was assigned to a research area
        at each of the three levels of the classification. Research areas consist
        of publications that are relatively strongly connected by citation links and
        that can therefore be expected to be topically related. At each level of the
        classification, a publication was assigned to only one research area, which
        means research areas do not overlap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Using the parameter
        values reported in Table 1, we obtained a classification that consists of
        4521 research areas at the lowest (most granular) level, 917 research areas
        at the middle level, and 20 research areas at the highest (least granular)
        level. We also algorithmically linked each research area in our classification
        to one or more of the following five broad main fields: biomedical and health
        sciences, life and earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
        sciences and engineering, and social sciences and humanities.</p><table style=\"width:400px;
        margin:auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\">Parameter</td><td

        margin-top:10px;\"><span class=\"caption\">Table 1. Parameter values used
        to build the classification.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nGiven the huge size of the
        citation network based on which we built the classification, the process of
        building the classification was computationally demanding. We used a computer
        with 200 GB internal memory. The process took about 70 hours on this computer.\r\n</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">Labeling the research areas in an algorithmically built publication
        classification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach introduced
        in our original methodology yields a list of five characteristic terms for
        each research area. While these terms usually give a reasonably good impression
        of the topics covered by a research area, our experience is that users often
        want to have a single term that summarizes what a research area is about.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">Large language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities
        to label research areas. We therefore used the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\"
        target=\"_blank\">Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo LLM</a>, developed by OpenAI, to label
        the 4521 research areas at the lowest level in our classification. The source
        code of our software can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For each research area, we provided
        the LLM with the titles of the 250 most cited publications in the area, along
        with the prompt shown in Box 1. Using this prompt, we asked the LLM to return
        a label for each research area, both a short one (max. three words) and a
        longer one (max. eight words). We also requested the LLM to provide a few
        sentences that summarize what the research area is about.</p><div style=\"padding:10px;
        background-color:#F5F5F5;\"><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">You will be provided
        with the titles of a representative sample of papers from a larger cluster
        of related scientific papers.</p><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">Your task is
        to identify the topic of the entire cluster based on the titles of the representative
        papers.</p><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">Output the following items (in English)
        that describe the topic of the cluster: 'short label' (at most 3 words and
        format in Title Case), 'long label' (at most 8 words and format in Title Case),
        list of 10 'keywords' (ordered by relevance and format in Title Case), 'summary'
        (few sentences), and 'wikipedia page' (URL).<br>\r\nDo not start short and
        long labels with the word \"The\".<br>\r\nStart each summary with \"This cluster
        of papers\".<br>\r\nFormat the output in JSON.\r\n</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center;
        margin-top:10px;\"><span class=\"caption\">Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM.\r\n</span></p><p>Table
        2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521 research areas.
        The results show that this research area is about bibliometrics. Although
        we did not perform a systematic evaluation of the quality of the LLM results,
        our impression is that the results are a substantial improvement over the
        results obtained using our original methodology, or variants of that methodology.
        We also tried to use the LLM to label the research areas at the middle level
        and the highest level in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory
        results.\r\n</p><table style=\"width:100%;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:100px;\">Short

        2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\r\n</span></p><p>\r\nWhile
        the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such as GPT
        3.5 raises complex legal and ethical questions that require further consideration.
        Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We paid slightly less than USD
        50 to label 4521 research areas. We also considered the use of GPT 4, but
        this LLM is more expensive and did not seem to yield better results.\r\n</p><h3>Visualizing
        the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A powerful way to use our publication
        classification is to create interactive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents
        an example of such a landscape. It was created using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\">VOSviewer
        Online software</a>. We used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas
        at the lowest level in our classification. Each bubble represents a research
        area. The larger the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the
        research area. The distance between bubbles approximately indicates the relatedness
        of research areas in terms of citation links. In general, the smaller the
        distance between two bubbles, the stronger the citation links between the
        two research areas. The color of a bubble shows the primary main field to
        which a research area belongs. For instance, research areas in the physical
        sciences and engineering (blue) are located on the left side of the landscape,
        while research areas in the social sciences and humanities (red) are located
        on the right side. Finally, for some bubbles, the landscape also shows the
        label obtained using our LLM-based labeling approach.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"

        in the classification. Colors show the primary main field to which a research
        area belongs. (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5\" target=\"_blank\">interactive
        version</a>)</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The landscape of science presented in
        Figure 1 can be explored in more detail in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5\"
        target=\"_blank\">this interactive webtool</a>. The webtool enables zooming
        in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also possible to see the list
        of publications included in each research area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To illustrate
        the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape to show the publication
        activity of our own institution, Leiden University. The landscape presented
        in Figure 2 is identical to the one in Figure 1, except that the color of
        a bubble now indicates the proportion of publications in a research area with
        authors affiliated with Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
        areas in which Leiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
        research area, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can
        be explored in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x\" target=\"_blank\">our
        interactive webtool</a>. The webtool for instance reveals that Leiden University
        has 570 publications in the period 2000-2023 in the research area labeled
        \u2018Bibliometric Analysis\u2019. This is one of the research areas in the
        social sciences and humanities in which Leiden University has its strongest
        publication activity.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"

        dir=\"ltr\">We have introduced an open approach for classifying research publications
        into research areas: Our approach relies on open data from OpenAlex, our software
        is open source, and our publication classification is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
        target=\"_blank\">openly available</a>. The work presented in this blog post
        is part of an <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
        target=\"_blank\">ambitious agenda</a> we have at CWTS to move to fully open
        approaches to bibliometrics, and to openness of research information and research
        analytics more generally.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The publication classification
        discussed in this blog post is a crucial building block for the Open Edition
        of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
        Ranking</a> that CWTS is going to release on January 30. The classification
        is also used by the OpenAlex team as a foundation for a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s\"
        target=\"_blank\">new topic classification for OpenAlex</a>. We hope our work
        will help to advance the transition to open approaches to bibliometrics!<br></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

        /><p>The Information &amp; Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes
        openness of research information. In this blog post, we present our agenda
        for the coming five years.</p><p>How to find the most relevant scientific
        literature on topic X? How to evaluate the research carried out by department
        Y? And how to establish new strategic priorities for university Z? These are
        just a few examples of the many important decisions that researchers, research
        evaluators, and science policy makers need to make on a daily basis. Decisions
        like these are increasingly made in data-driven ways, guided by research analytics
        ranging from simple scientometric indicators and university rankings to complex
        dashboards that bring together data from a variety of sources.</p><h3>The
        Information & Openness focal area</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Last year the Information
        & Openness focal area was established at CWTS. In this focal area we are concerned
        with the complex interplay between decision making processes in science, the
        information used in these processes, and the nature of this information in
        terms of properties such as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership.
        This complex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements
        with global aspirations: open science and responsible research assessment.
        Our work in the focal area builds on decades of experience we have at CWTS
        in using scientometric data to support research assessment and strategic decision
        making in science. Having been at the forefront of developments in scientometrics,
        we not only have a lot of knowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
        and algorithms, but we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
        plays in all kinds of decision-making processes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Building
        on our experience and recognizing that decisions in science are increasingly
        being made in data-driven ways, the Information & Openness focal area aims
        to study and promote responsible approaches to the use of data in decision
        making processes in science. We are interested in the properties of the data
        sources that are being used and how these properties contribute to, or impede,
        responsible ways of decision making. The field of scientometrics has a long
        tradition of working with proprietary data sources, especially Web of Science
        and Scopus. However, the closed nature of these data sources is increasingly
        seen as an obstacle to transparent and responsible decision making, for instance
        in the context of research assessment. In the Information & Openness focal
        area we are therefore particularly interested in studying and promoting openness
        of scientometric data, and of research information more generally.</p><h3><strong>Three
        pillars</strong></h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the organization of the&nbsp;<a
        href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts\" target=\"_blank\">broader
        knowledge agenda of CWTS</a>, our work in the Information & Openness focal
        area is organized in three pillars: understanding, intervening, and practicing.
        In the box below we outline our plans for each of these pillars.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p
        dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Understanding</strong></p><p
        dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the understanding pillar we perform
        research projects with the broad goal of developing a comprehensive and critical
        understanding of the open research information landscape. Based on our scientometric
        expertise, some projects in this pillar may focus on systematically monitoring
        and tracking the availability of open research information. Drawing on our
        expertise in sociology, anthropology, and science and technology studies,
        other projects may be aimed at describing and explaining what shapes, enables,
        and constrains the spread, or non-spread, of open information practices.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Intervening</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"
        style=\"font-size:14px;\">In the intervening pillar we take concrete actions
        to advance openness of research information, aiming to make openness of research
        information the norm and to enable more transparent and responsible approaches
        to decision making in science. An example is the transformation of the <a
        href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS Leiden Ranking</a> to a tool
        that is entirely based on open data, resulting in a fully transparent and
        reproducible ranking. The first release of the Open Edition of the Leiden
        Ranking will take place later this month, on January 30. Another example is
        the launch of the course<a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics
        Using Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the<a
        href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\"> Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative
        (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took place in November last year,
        and a next edition will be organized in March this year. Other actions to
        advance openness of research information are currently in preparation. We
        expect to share some announcements in the coming months.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"
        style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Practicing</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Following
        the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing pillar focuses
        on implementing openness of research information in our own way of working
        at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work at CWTS (including<a
        href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\"> CWTS BV</a>) to be fully based on open research
        information. In particular, our aim is that future scientometric analyses
        performed by our center will use only data from open sources, such as Crossref,
        DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex, OpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
        of a broader ambition to open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
        way we communicate about our research and about other activities of our center.
        This will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open
        science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research
        data management</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Our way of working</strong></h3><p
        dir=\"ltr\">The team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
        more than 20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
        in the understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or
        practicing pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest developments
        around open research information, to share updates on ongoing projects and
        other activities, and to make plans for new initiatives.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our
        work also aims to contribute to strengthening the other two focal areas of
        CWTS:<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
        target=\"_blank\"> Engagement & Inclusion</a> and Evaluation & Culture. Through
        the<a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
        target=\"_blank\"> UNESCO Lab on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science</a>
        we for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information & Openness
        and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/\"
        target=\"_blank\"> GraspOS project</a> and the<a href=\"https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra\"

        Research Assessment (OI4RRA)</a> demonstrates the value of cross fertilization
        between the Information & Openness and Evaluation & Culture focal areas.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">We are also setting up collaborations with external partners working
        on open research information. Many organizations are doing crucial work in
        this area. This ranges from research groups that study openness of research
        information to organizations that provide infrastructures for open research
        information and organizations that put the use of open research information
        into practice (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database\"

        /><p>In a new research project, we  explore the interaction between misinformation
        and science on social media during COVID-19. This is part of the new research
        line on the role of science in societal debates of our Focal Area Engagement
        &amp; Inclusion.</p><p>The past years have shown that science can play an
        important role in societal debates. Science was clearly pivotal in the development
        of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, many of the interventions and policies,
        such as masking, school closures or even curfews, were presented as evidence-based
        solutions, motivated by scientific advances in our understanding of the virus.
        In return, these policies and scientific findings were part of broader societal
        debates, with sometimes vocal proponents and opponents in contentious and
        sometimes polarised settings. Although very visible during the COVID-19 pandemic,
        science also plays a large role in other societal debates, such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180\"
        target=\"_blank\">the nitrogen debate in the Netherlands</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies\"
        target=\"_blank\">climate change</a>.</p><p>As a part of our <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap\"
        target=\"_blank\">Focal Area of Engagement & Inclusion</a> at CWTS, we explore
        the role of science in societal debates. We know that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\"
        target=\"_blank\">science does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates
        or clear course of action for polic</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308\">y</a>.
        Some of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal debates,
        are different \u201Csides\u201D informed by different literatures, perhaps
        reinforcing their own convictions? Or do different sides share a common evidence
        base from science? Does new scientific information lead to a convergence or
        to a divergence of opinions? Does the open availability of scientific literature
        shape the role of science in societal debates? Do scientists and societal
        actors interpret scientific results differently? How are these interpretations
        used in arguments? How do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?
        </p><p>In addition to science, misinformation also plays a large role in societal
        debates. During COVID-19, this prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO)
        to speak of an <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic\" target=\"_blank\">infodemic</a>.
        Some of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by fact-checkers,
        such as <a href=\"https://maldita.es/\" target=\"_blank\">maldita.es</a>\r\nin
        Spain, or the local \u201C<a href=\"https://nieuwscheckers.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Nieuwscheckers</a>\u201D
        here at Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness by
        the public, such as \u201C<a href=\"https://askforevidence.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask
        for Evidence</a>\u201D or \u201C<a href=\"https://www.bemediasmart.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop,
        Think, Check</a>\u201D, to help prevent the spread of misinformation. But
        how does science interact with misinformation?</p><h3>Science and misinformation</h3><p>We
        are excited to start a new project on <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed\"
        target=\"_blank\">Understanding Misinformation and Science in Societal Debates
        (UnMiSSeD)</a>. In this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation
        and science during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and qualitative
        approaches. Our quantitative analyses will be limited to Twitter (now X),
        based on more than a billion tweets posted during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined
        with information on millions of publications and tweets about them. We will
        go beyond Twitter in our qualitative analyses to explore how discussions permeate
        the porous boundaries of social media. We will collaborate with Fondazione
        Bruno Kessler (FBK), lead by <a href=\"https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8\"
        target=\"_blank\">Riccardo Gallotti</a> and University of Geneva, lead by
        <a href=\"http://www.tommasoventurini.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Tommaso Venturini</a>.
        We are happy that this project is supported by the <a href=\"https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/\"
        target=\"_blank\">European Media and Information Fund</a>.</p><h3>New perspective</h3><p>At
        CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427\"
        target=\"_blank\">connections between science and society</a>, also in the
        context of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset\"
        target=\"_blank\">COVID-19</a>. We also studied how COVID-19 appeared in <a
        href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation\"
        target=\"_blank\">a media outlet</a>. Much of our knowledge on science in
        social media is based on data from <a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Altmetric</a>\r\nand provides a good lens on which aspects
        of academic publications relate to being mentioned on (social) media. Previous
        projects at CWTS departed from science and explored where science was mentioned,
        referenced and taken up. However, this approach misses the broader contexts
        in which science is mentioned. Societal debates are multifaceted processes
        <a href=\"http://modesofexistence.org/\" target=\"_blank\">where scientific
        mentions are couched in and interact with other ways of knowing the world</a>.
        In the UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates themselves.
        \ We explore when and how science becomes part of such debates, also in relation
        to misinformation and claims unrelated to science. In this way, we hope to
        better understand the role of science and misinformation in societal debates.</p><p>This
        project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at CWTS.
        Traditionally, our centre is more focused on science (and technology) studies.
        The UnMiSSeD project brings in not only computational social sciences but
        also media and communication studies and has clear connections to science
        communication. We hope to build out these connections in the near future.

        /><p>In September 2023, the city of Leiden in the Netherlands was the venue
        for not just one, but two scientometrics-related events: the CWTS Scientometrics
        Summer School and the STI 2023 conference. Our author attended both and reflects
        on his experience.</p><p>Greetings from Peru, nestled in the heart of the
        Andes, where I find myself reflecting on two transformative events in my scientific
        journey: the CWTS Scientometrics Summer School (CS<sup>3</sup>) and the 27th
        International Conference on Science, Technology, and Innovation Indicators
        (STI 2023). As a bibliometrics enthusiast for the past two decades, this experience
        has been nothing short of a revelation\u2014a journey that prompted me to
        question the very fabric of scientific evaluation and metrics.</p><p>Two decades
        ago, my foray into bibliometrics was marked by conventional survey field research.
        Fast forward ten years, and I realized the untapped potential of bibliometrics
        in advancing Library and Information Science (LIS). My maiden bibliometric
        study delved into the controversial realm of the h-index, assessing its utility
        in gauging the scientific output of Peruvian researchers. The journey took
        a pivotal turn in 2015 when I attended the \u201CMeasuring Science and Research
        Performance\u201D&nbsp;course at CWTS in Leiden, a week that unraveled the
        limitations and detrimental consequences associated with relying on the h-index
        for critical decisions like research grants or promotions.</p><p>Why the focus
        on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested journal impact factor,
        it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently misused bibliometric indicators.
        Over almost a decade of dedicated bibliometric studies, I couldn't ignore
        the grim reality in many South American countries\u2014bibliometric reports
        often perpetuate the status quo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
        meant to guide and inform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
        elusive citations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks
        rather than addressing pressing regional and local needs.</p><p>Even workshops
        advocating for open science, while championing transparency and accessibility,
        often fell short. Discussions on alternative indicators typically revolve
        around metrics tied to downloads or citations from open information sources.
        While open-access publishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
        few consider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for example,
        sharing bibliographic datasets or the R/Stata codes essential for transparent
        data analysis.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\"
        alt=\"Day 2 vevrvolg 11\"><figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023
        conference.</figcaption></figure><p>Eight years after my inaugural visit to
        Leiden, I had the privilege of returning to participate in the <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023\"
        target=\"_blank\">CS3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\" target=\"_blank\">STI
        2023</a>. These events were crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered
        a wealth of perspectives that ignited new possibilities for my own research
        journey. The incorporation of insights from the sociology of science and science
        and technology studies (STS) offered a refreshing lens, challenging us to
        move beyond mere numbers and delve into the social and cultural contexts that
        shape scientific knowledge production. Exploring diverse information sources,
        beyond the confines of established databases, promised a more nuanced understanding
        of scientific impact, particularly in regions often marginalized by traditional
        bibliometric approaches.</p><p>But most importantly, the shared experiences
        and diverse perspectives of colleagues from across the globe truly resonated.
        The STI 2023 conference brought together Global North and South voices, bridging
        the gap between established research powerhouses and emerging scientific ecosystems.
        Through open dialogue and critical reflection, we began to dismantle the monolithic
        assumptions that often underpin bibliometric analysis. We acknowledged the
        distinct dynamics of scientific production in different regions and the varying
        priorities and challenges faced by researchers in high-income and low-middle-income
        countries.</p><p>This newfound awareness, I believe, is the key to unlocking
        the true potential of bibliometrics. By embracing diversity, incorporating
        critical perspectives, and forging connections across borders, we can transform
        this field from a passive observer into an active agent for positive change.
        We can use bibliometrics not to reinforce existing inequalities but to guide
        us toward a more inclusive and equitable scientific landscape, one where research
        serves the needs of all, regardless of their geographic location or economic

        /><p>At the STI 2023 conference, an experiment was performed with a more open
        approach to publication and peer review of conference submissions. In this
        post, the conference organisers present an evaluation of this experiment.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">Open science was one of the key topics at the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators (STI) conference</a>
        that CWTS organised in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science
        was not only discussed at the conference but was also put into practice in
        the publication and peer review process of the conference. By way of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference\"
        target=\"_blank\">experiment</a>, all papers submitted to the conference were
        published as a preprint before they were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer
        review process was open: Review reports were published alongside the preprinted
        papers, and some reviewers also chose to sign their reports.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">What
        did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate the experiment, we invited
        all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete a brief anonymous survey
        (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing\"
        target=\"_blank\">survey form</a>; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing\"
        target=\"_blank\">survey responses</a>). Survey invitations were sent after
        the conference. We received 93 responses, corresponding to a response rate
        of 50%. Below we discuss the outcomes of the survey.<br></p><h3>Preprinting</h3><p
        dir=\"ltr\">We first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about
        preprinting of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference submissions
        is strongly supported. 51% of the respondents selected the highest score (5),
        indicating they \"like it a lot\", and an additional 37% of the respondents
        selected the second-highest score (4). Only a small minority of 6% of the
        respondents do not support preprinting and selected the lowest (1; \"I don't
        like it at all\") or second-lowest (2) score.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"
        data-image=\"37790\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>When asked what they see
        as advantages and disadvantages of preprinting of conference submissions,
        respondents indicated they appreciate the early access and visibility of research
        through preprinting. The ability to receive feedback and engage with peers
        is also seen as an advantage. In addition, preprinting enables researchers
        to establish priority on emerging topics. However, concerns revolve around
        the quality assurance of preprints, with worries that some submissions represent
        ongoing work that still needs further development, in which case preprinting
        may undermine the credibility of the research. There is also a risk that early-career
        researchers may feel pressured by the open nature of preprints.<br></p><h3>Open
        peer review</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Support for open peer review is almost as strong
        as support for preprinting. 73% of the survey respondents expressed support
        for open peer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents were opposed
        to open peer review (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"
        data-image=\"37805\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents recognized several
        advantages of open peer review, including enhanced transparency, constructive
        feedback, and accountability of reviewers. However, respondents expressed
        concerns about variations in review quality and about the potential impact
        of negative reviews, especially on early-career researchers. Some respondents
        indicated a preference for fully anonymous peer review, to make sure author
        identities do not influence reviewers.<br></p><h3>Future editions of the STI
        conference</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Survey respondents are very positive about the
        idea of adopting preprinting and open peer review at future editions of the
        STI conference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score of
        4 or 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).</p><figure><img
        src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"
        data-image=\"37820\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents also offered
        suggestions for improvement. They would value more thorough reviews, increased
        transparency in the decision-making process, and well-defined evaluation criteria.
        Some respondents recommended improving the selection and assignment of reviewers.
        Several respondents felt there is a need to have a more user-friendly platform
        for publishing and reviewing conference submissions.<br></p><h3>Strengths
        and weaknesses of the Orvium platform</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The opinions of survey
        respondents about the <a href=\"https://dapp.orvium.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Orvium
        platform</a>, which was used to publish and review conference submissions,
        are a bit more mixed. When asked about their satisfaction with the platform,
        66% of the respondents gave a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave
        a negative response (score 1 or 2), but there is also a significant share
        of the respondents (25%) that gave a neutral response (score of 3).</p><figure><img
        src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"
        data-image=\"37843\"></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"><br>Respondents mentioned several
        strengths of the Orvium platform, including the platform's ability to issue
        DOIs, support for having multiple versions of a paper, and the generation
        of \u2018previews\u2019 of papers for convenient reading in a web browser.
        However, a number of weaknesses were also mentioned. While some respondents
        considered the platform easy to use, others found that navigation was challenging
        and the interface confusing. Respondents also reported problems with the platform's
        search function.<br></p><h3>Impact of the STI 2023 conference on open science
        perspectives</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We also asked survey respondents whether the
        STI 2023 conference changed their ideas about open science. Most respondents
        reported that their views on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
        were already supportive of open science. However, a significant share of the
        respondents found that the conference reinforced their positive views of open
        science. These respondents for instance mentioned that they appreciate the
        practical implementation of open science at the conference. At the same time,
        some respondents reported that the conference made them more aware of potential
        drawbacks of open science, such as information overload and problems in quality
        assurance processes.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the outcomes
        of the survey, we consider the experiment with preprinting and open peer review
        at the STI 2023 conference to be successful. While some survey respondents
        are critical, a large majority of the respondents are positive about the experiment.
        Moreover, over three-quarters of the respondents recommend that future editions
        of the STI conference adopt preprinting and open peer review. The feedback
        provided by respondents offers excellent guidance for making further improvements
        to publication and peer review processes at the STI conference, hopefully
        enabling the full potential of open science to be realized.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We

        Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST) and the Society
        for Social Studies of Science (4S) join forces to organize the largest conference
        in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) in the world. From 16
        to 19 July, 2024 <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/\" target=\"_blank\">the
        conference</a> is hosted by the Athena Institute in Amsterdam. The call for
        abstracts was recently launched with an impressive list of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/\"
        target=\"_blank\">397 open panels</a> proposed by STS scholars from across
        the globe. There is an enormous diversity of topics that are being addressed
        in the open panels and it promises to be an exciting conference!</p><p>CWTS
        is among the larger centres in the field of STS in the Netherlands and we
        are proud to have CWTS colleagues involved in 9 panels. These panels show
        not only the diversity of topics in STS but also the diversity of approaches
        and topics studied at CWTS. Below we present the different panels we are involved
        in. We hope to receive your <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/\"

        target=\"_blank\"><em>Marine Transformations: Exploring the technoscience
        behind our changing relationship with the seas</em></a>&nbsp;is organized
        by Jackie Ashkin in collaboration with Sebastian Ureta (Universidad Cat\xF3lica
        de Chile), Elis Jones (University of Exeter), and Jose A. Ca\xF1ada (University
        of Helsinki). This panel begins from the observation that the world\u2019s
        oceans are in peril. Human actions both threaten and promise to save the ocean,
        but how do technoscientific enterprises contribute to transforming human-ocean
        relations? We invite contributions which explore the more-than-human, technoscientific
        and ethicopolitical dimensions of knowing and relating to the ocean.</p><p>Panel
        number 071, simply entitled <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14110\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>Seabirds</em></a> is organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS,
        University of Edinburgh and CWTS) with Bronte Evans Rayward (SPRI, University
        of Cambridge) and Oscar Hartman Davies (University of Oxford). The Open Panel
        aims to gather case studies and discussions on seabirds to engage with contemporary
        urgent matters such as environmental change and the Anthropocene. We seek
        to engage with STS topics such as technological developments, multispecies
        and more-than-human studies, and space and its materialities. We welcome contributions
        focused on seabirds or where seabirds play an intriguing role in addressing
        socio-technical matters. What can seabirds teach us? </p><p>Panel number 074
        explores <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The
        limits of Open Research: critical views and new perspectives</em></a> and
        is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open panel critically
        examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the enactment of its core values
        of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As the OS infrastructural landscape
        evolves, there is an underlying assumption that these values will support
        the evolution of an equitable digital commons and, in consequence, equitable
        science. Nonetheless, simply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
        design can be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage
        with the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment, raising
        questions relating to limits of openness, meaningful connectivity and digital
        democratisation. </p><p>Panel number 145, <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14191\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>Scientific cultures in conflict and transition: Studying
        reform in action</em></a><em>,</em> addresses the recent proliferation of
        science reform movements, including open science, meta-science, responsible
        research and innovation, responsible metrics, and research ssessment reform.
        These \u2018upstream\u2019 reform movements seek to address what campaigners
        consider declining standards of quality or propriety around academic knowledge
        production, communication and evaluation within their own professional world.
        This open panel is co-convened by our CWTS colleague Alex Rushforth, together
        with Bart Penders (Maastricht University/Aachen University), and Nicole Nelson
        (University of Wisconsin Madison). They invite case study contributions on
        one or more scientific reform movement(s) which advocate a specific view on
        the right way to conduct scientific practice(s).</p><p>Panel number 154, entitled
        <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14200\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Making
        and Doing Oceanic Futures: Mobilising the ocean and its materialities between
        hope and loss</em></a> is organized by Francesco Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad
        and Judit Varga. The Panel explores the ocean as an object of study and concern&nbsp;in
        various knowledge and artistic practices. It queries how oceanic futures are
        entangled with hope and loss and how these futures intersect with socio-political,
        scientific, economic, industrial, and ecological processes. This panel welcomes
        traditional presentations and artistic contributions (e.g. performances, films,
        or spoken words), and invites interventions about the ocean as an object of
        study and an object of concern.<br></p><p>Panel number 299 aims to bring together
        studies of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378\" target=\"_blank\"><em>new
        notions of research quality</em></a><em>. </em>Various reform movements and
        science policy interventions have been adding new elements to conceptions
        of quality in research-performing organisations. Co-convened by Marta Sienkiewicz,
        Tjitske Holtrop and Thed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel invites contributions
        bringing an STS lens to the study of new quality notions, the reform movements
        that support them and the evaluative situations where they count. We seek
        to generate reflections of theoretical and practical significance for (e)valuation,
        standardisation and justification of quality in research assessments. The
        panel will combine academic presentations with an interactive workshop.</p><p>Panel
        number 328, entitled <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14411\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing ties between
        academic research and polluting industries</em></a> is organized by Jorrit
        Smit and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration with former colleague Guus
        Dix (UTwente), as well as Shivant Jhagroe and Dominika Czerniawska from other
        faculties of Leiden University. In this panel, we want to explore experimental
        ways for STS to engage with the \u201Ccut the ties\u201D debate around campuses
        worldwide. We aim to host a methodologically diverse gathering in which we
        can collectively \u2018excavate\u2019 data and address pivotal political-epistemic
        effects of ties between extractivist polluting industries and academic research
        in times of climate crisis.</p><p>Panel 340 develops the notion of <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>More-than human research and Innovation</em></a>. It
        is organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of Edinburgh)
        and Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The panel seeks
        to bring multispecies studies into onversation with STS focusing especially
        on the productive unruliness of mutlispecies collaboration. We seek to think
        about in/exclusion of other-than human stakeholders and the conceptualization
        and realization of agency in ecological restoration, sustainable agriculture,
        and other future ecologies, as well as environmental science and governance,
        for example the instantiation of the \u201Cdo no significant harm\u201D principle
        in European research and innovation. </p><p>Panel 397 deals with <a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>Responsible innovation in chemistry</em></a>. It is
        organized by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte Asveld and
        Britte Bouchaut (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht University). Chemical
        pollution is a main driver for global biodiversity loss and the emissions
        of chemical industry contribute substantially to climate change. Regulation
        often falls short of adequately addressing all negative impacts of novel chemicals.
        This session calls for papers addressing the opportunities for and barriers
        to responsible innovation in academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge
        produced and what standards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional
        frameworks impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical sector?
        What is the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating with industry?
        </p><p>The call for abstract is now<a href=\"https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/\"
        target=\"_blank\"> open</a> and will close on 12 February 2024. In case you
        are interested in submitting an abstract but are unsure whether your paper
        fits the panel, do reach out to the panel organisers. All our panel organisers
        would be happy to discuss possible contributions.</p><p><span class=\"caption\"><strong>This

        that engages with society is of paramount importance. As we navigate complex
        global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence,
        it becomes evident that diverse perspectives, inclusive participation and
        public engagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication are key
        to unlocking science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal Area
        Engagement & Inclusion <em>envisions studying and promoting diversity and
        inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement and communication
        between science and society.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the three
        pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda \u2013 <em>understanding</em>, <em>intervening
        </em>and <em>practising </em>\u2013 we developed an ambitious agenda for the
        study and promotion of diversity, inclusion, engagement, communication and
        science-society interactions. Our work will not only contribute to research
        and teaching around these questions, but will also support policy developments
        and interventions, and generate insights into how we can implement our findings
        at our own centre.</p><h3>Representation & Inclusiveness</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We
        believe diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is important.
        By breaking down barriers to participation in science for individuals from
        a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we enrich the pool of
        knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which, in turn, helps to address
        scientific and societal challenges more effectively. Who gets to participate
        in science is not always self-evident and requires more fundamental understanding
        and well-considered interventions to improve the inclusion and representation
        of all social groups in science, and the science system as a whole.</p><h3>Epistemic
        Diversity</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Epistemic diversity in the science system is
        of major importance. We need to recognise how different topics, research questions,
        knowledge systems, and actors, including <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040\"
        target=\"_blank\">other-than-human</a> ones, help to produce a fairer and
        more nuanced understanding of complex global issues. By monitoring and promoting
        epistemic diversity, we expect to foster a more inclusive and innovative environment
        where different ways of knowing are valued and incorporated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">For instance, we want to study and address the lack of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development\"
        target=\"_blank\">coverage</a> in mainstream scientometric databases; a problem
        that stands in the way of making important societal topics visible in science
        policy. Consequently, we expect to develop <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>multiversatories</em></a>, policies, and recommendations
        to support funders and science policy with reinforcing epistemic diversity.</p><h3>Engagement
        & Communication</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A research system that is disconnected
        from society is essentially ineffective. Science communication, public engagement
        with science, and participatory approaches for collaborative knowledge production
        are integral building blocks for a stronger and more relevant research and
        innovation ecosystem. Effective science communication and public engagement
        help to bridge the gap between academia and society; help to make scientific
        approaches and knowledge more accessible to the wider public and societal
        stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry, etc.); limit the impact of misinformation
        and the misuse of scientific information; and may help to increase public
        trust in science. We will study how society engages with science, in order
        to improve science communication and strengthen the role science can play
        in society.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science\"
        target=\"_blank\">Citizen science</a> and other participatory approaches can
        create a stronger sense of societal ownership and accountability, turning
        scientific research into a collective societal endeavour. Societal actors
        outside academia contribute to the scientific ecosystem in various ways, for
        instance with local and traditional knowledge or insights from lived experience,
        or by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making. The engagement of societal
        actors can also direct the attention of research to issues of societal importance,
        increasing both their societal relevance and their practical impacts. Engaging
        other actors, such as industry, policy-makers or non-governmental organisations,
        can help with more informed policy, decision-making and innovation. We want
        to study citizen-science practices and how they are changing scientific outcomes,
        with the aim of helping to shape citizen-science further.</p><h3>Accomplishing
        our ambitions</h3><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><br><strong></strong></h4><h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Coordination
        of dreams, people, and projects</strong></h4><p dir=\"ltr\">The real treasure
        trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion is all the individual members
        with their own areas of expertise, projects, <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts\"
        target=\"_blank\">dreams</a>, and activities. We are a team of more than 30
        colleagues from a variety of backgrounds and career stages.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As
        a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD projects, and personal
        <em>dreams</em> into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised as
        <em>ambitions</em>!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e., <a href=\"https://www.cwtsbv.nl/\"
        target=\"_blank\">BV</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects\"
        target=\"_blank\">institute projects</a>, and the work of the <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab\"
        target=\"_blank\">Citizen Science Lab</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science\"
        target=\"_blank\">UNESCO lab</a> (Figure 1). This mapping formed an excellent
        means for thinking about our future activities.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/board_fullsize.jpg\"

        labelled as <em>ambitions</em>) - Miro board</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><h4
        dir=\"ltr\">The roadmap</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">We have created a working group
        for each of the three sub-areas to bundle expertise and resources. The working
        groups will bring together a diverse range of colleagues, from within and
        outside of CWTS, each contributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the
        complex challenges of the sub-areas. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Projects play a pivotal
        role in our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal Area will help coordinate existing
        projects,  and monitor funding opportunities to set up new projects. Our focused
        strategy of aligning projects with the goals of the Focal Area will be crucial
        for achieving our vision and ambitions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, engagement
        and communication activities will be of central importance for the Focal Area.
        We think of <a href=\"https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science\"
        target=\"_blank\">dedicated seminars</a>, special sessions at conferences
        (e.g. a special session on \u201C<a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Researching (in-) equity, diversity and inclusion in science

        at the <a href=\"https://www.sti2023.org/program/\" target=\"_blank\">STI
        2023 conference</a>), or co-creation workshops with citizens and societal
        stakeholders. In line with our ideal of <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028\"
        target=\"_blank\">practising what we preach</a>, we ourselves will communicate
        our work and activities to broader audiences through blog posts and social
        media, and look forward to open and engaging conversations with others on
        these topics.  </p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in partnering with

        /><p>In this blog post, we examine key historical moments in research assessment,
        access to, and affordability of published research, to explain why Open Access
        and its economic models have become an incremental solution to a problem requiring
        a revolutionary change.</p><h3>Open access: a change in publishing with a
        limited reach</h3><p>Open Access is a movement and policy directive dedicated
        to reforming the closed or subscription-based gatekeeping of scientific research.
        In the subscription-based&nbsp;(when readers pay) model scientists communicate
        the results of their research, by submitting it to publishers, and in many
        cases to one of a small number of large commercial publishers, considered
        to be <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502\"
        target=\"_blank\">an oligopoly</a>. Publishers 'process' this work, then provide
        academic institutions (i.e., libraries) with an 'opportunity' to buy back
        research via journal subscriptions. This is neither sound economically, nor
        is it conducive to the growth of scientific knowledge. Open Access has therefore
        become a critically assessed and well-researched subject, focused on alternative
        approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold, and hybrid journal publishing,
        and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by institutions or scholars themselves
        (author pays model). As a global project there is ample evidence that Open
        Access has a <a href=\"https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555\" target=\"_blank\">limited
        reach</a>. </p><h3>Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)</h3><p>Dr.
        Eugene Garfield is a renowned figure in certain scientific communities for
        having founded the <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/\"
        target=\"_blank\">Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)</a>, and for
        his <a href=\"http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">innovation
        in automated journal citation indexing - the first <em>Science Citation Index</em></a>.
        Dr. Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!); long
        enough to see his <em>Science Citation Index</em> grow to be one of the most
        useful reference tools for scholars and scientometricians worldwide. Today,
        this index has been expanded commercially to include additional products,
        which are now part of Clarivate's trademarked <em>Web of Science\u2122</em>.
        \ </p><p>Dr. Garfield's vision was not only to trace the history of ideas,
        but develop a tool to assist university/college libraries with their journal
        selection needs: a one-time legitimate process that had already been on the
        minds of other scientists. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803\"
        target=\"_blank\">Gross and Gross (1927)</a> are credited by Garfield for
        being the first to ask: \"<em>What files of scientific periodicals are needed
        in a college library to prepare the student for advanced work... ?</em>\".
        The answer was to \"<em>compile a journal list\u201D</em> considered to be
        \"<em>indispensable</em>\", and to base this list on an <em>\"arbitrary standard
        of some kind by which to determine the desirability of purchasing a particular
        journal\"</em> (p. 1713). That arbitrary standard was to focus on their citedness.
        Years later, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf\"
        target=\"_blank\">Brodman (1944)</a> became a critic of <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803\"
        target=\"_blank\">Gross and Gross's (1922</a>) quantitative method, then shortly
        after, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733\" target=\"_blank\">Fussler
        (1949)</a> took up the task again of listing leading journals. However, it
        was Dr. Garfield, along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who introduced
        the <a href=\"http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf\"
        target=\"_blank\">Journal Impact Factor (JIF</a>).</p><p>For a long time,
        <em>the Science Citation Index</em> had a positive impact. Although Garfield
        both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the JIF when evaluating individuals,
        he is \u2018blissfully\u2019 unaware of the scale of problems resulting from
        the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x\"
        target=\"_blank\">use of the Journal Impact Factor</a>. Now, we are looking
        down a long dark hallway leading to what some might call '<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/\"
        target=\"_blank\">grimpact</a>'. If we exit this dark hallway, we veer into
        a lit room called 'Open Access', but, how does this relate to research assessment,
        and when did we get here? To answer this, we can go further back in history,
        when science first handed itself over to the profitable business of scholarly
        publishing.</p><h3>The growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)</h3><p>When
        scientific letters, reports, and later periodicals first appeared (i.e., the
        <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em></a>)
        there were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses. Early
        editors, like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the <em>Philosophical
        Transactions</em>), were keen to generate income, but soon recognized how
        difficult it was to process, print, collect subscription fees and manage society
        publications without accruing financial losses. Commercial publishing grew
        at one time from a legitimate and realistic need. Editors required the support,
        and were for the most part, relieved to hand over the work. In the beginning
        scientific publishing was not profitable, but gradually it became more so.
        New businesses were founded, and for the past three and half centuries we
        have seen journals grow at an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159\"
        target=\"_blank\">exponential rate,</a>\r\namounting to more than <a href=\"https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579\"
        target=\"_blank\">30,000</a>, though according to <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A\"
        target=\"_blank\">recent estimates</a>, this number falls woefully short.
        </p><h3>Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)</h3><p>We have now
        moved further and further away from this print-based history, having stepped
        firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing is less costly, and affords
        a significantly broader reach. However, the commercial subscription model
        paired with the ISI-Citation Index and elite selection of journals (based
        on the JIF) contributes not only to the evaluation problem, but the access
        problem as well.</p><p>With the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is
        transitioning towards a \u2018flipped\u2019 publishing economy solution, with
        an increasing market concentration of academic publishers. This development
        is pushed by science policy and transformative agreements, but also by the
        acquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side business models are
        slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models, but we cannot assume
        that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219\" target=\"_blank\">there
        will always be enough money in the academic system</a>. Some scholars can
        benefit from <a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Plan
        S</a>, which allows them to rely on public research funding to make research
        results immediately accessible, but such affordability is not available to
        all. Research shows that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for
        publication, <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574\"
        target=\"_blank\">consideration is still given to the prestige attached to
        a highly-ranked journal</a>. Empirical studies in the field of biomedicine
        have also shown how <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5\"
        target=\"_blank\">knowledge production is consolidated around the JIF.</a>
        Many journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185\"
        target=\"_blank\">strong age bias</a>. And, in the age of AI, new empirical
        research has found that a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5\"
        target=\"_blank\">journal\u2019s impact factor is a bad predictor for \u2018thoroughness\u2019
        and \u2018helpfulness\u2019 of reviews.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, it seems more
        important than ever to ask ourselves how we can continue with Open Access,
        when the technology behind indexing, and the journal reputation economy has
        added to continued problems.<br></p><h3>Open Access Ideology<br></h3><p>Most
        academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open Access ideologists.
        Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish content in any journal which
        is currently not freely available and fully accessible. Some might even refuse
        to carry out peer review for publishers that they do not respect <em>(note:
        Why should I volunteer my time and efforts to support a greedy industry?)</em></p><p>An
        approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though it is
        meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is socially
        and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader scientific
        community, especially <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars\"
        target=\"_blank\">at a time when peer review is in crisis</a>. Scholars are
        responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst this tension between
        open access and paywalled content. The last thing that we need is fewer reviewers
        to call upon, or at least one less in situations where certain researchers
        have little choice but to publish in one of the commercially indexed, paywalled
        journals.</p><p>Perhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that we
        focus<em> solely </em>on current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is
        it not time to exit the well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
        again, towards a radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?</p><h3>Socio-Technical
        Innovation</h3><p>The creation of a systemic change, or shift in perceptions
        and behaviour patterns within our global scientific community implies that
        <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&\"
        target=\"_blank\">innovation starts with some sort of \u2018symbolic strategy\u2019</a>.
        A strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to relinquish
        the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially in evaluation
        systems.</p><p>Dr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time.
        He took us from the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced
        to the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web 5.0 -
        the open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that <a href=\"https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web\"
        target=\"_blank\">Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s idea behind the Web in the first
        place was to keep track of scientific information</a>! In addition to a symbolic
        shift within the scientific/scholarly communication system we can move towards
        a material or tangible shift.</p><p>Imagine, therefore; a reputation economy
        in science/scholarship, which is not attached to journal rank and title. What
        is a scientific journal, if not its editor-in-chief, editorial board, and
        thousands of volunteer academics worldwide who peer review submitted manuscripts?
        Many, if not most scholars believe in preserving the journal, and we will
        likely find it difficult to forget about them. Journals perform a constituent
        and organising role; a tangible outlet for scientific fields and disciplines.
        But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions, we might rather focus
        on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating, disseminating, and archiving
        function of journals, whilst keeping in mind that<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/\"
        target=\"_blank\"><em>their real value</em> lies in the communities that they
        create.</a></p><p>Editors and editorial teams, for example, may choose to
        forgo journal <em>titles </em>altogether and exit a commercial publisher (Note:
        <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1\"
        target=\"_blank\">Exits do happen, as in the case of an editor and editorial
        board leaving a commercial publisher to form a new Open Access journal</a>).
        In Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if \u2018by any other name\u2019
        the rose would \u2018smell as sweet!\u2019 (i.e., journal name is different,
        but the editorial community is the same, and scholars continue to respect
        that editorial community)? In a similar vein, editorial boards might be encouraged
        to leave a commercial publisher, and move to an Open Access International
        Scholarship Space: A space <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh\"
        target=\"_blank\">focused on managing and maintaining digitally transformed
        scholarly records</a>, which fulfils the traditional functions of a journal,
        ready to adapt to any future needs.</p><p>Imagine a solution where an editor
        and editorial team are assigned to a topic management center of their own
        creation (i.e., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007\" target=\"_blank\">a
        kind of digital library</a> or <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/5564003\"
        target=\"_blank\">scholarly digital infrastructure</a>). At each online center,
        there could be a description of the topic area, including the specialty research
        areas of the editorial team. So, for example, if we renounce a commercially
        published journal called the \u201C<em>Journal of the Information Age</em>\u201D
        and renounce the titled journal called \u201C<em>Quantitative Studies of Quantitativeness</em>\u201D,
        our international community would then think about putting an article up for
        review at the \u201CA Topic-Editorial Team\u201D or the \u201CB Topic-Editorial
        Team\u201D.</p><p> Whatever solution we choose, it starts with abandoning
        journal titles and rank then shifting to an innovative international socio-technological
        platform, based on key journal functions. The result would still be accessible
        research, still peer reviewed, and valued according to what should be valued:
        editorial teams and engaged peer review.</p><p>This solution may be realised
        in many different shapes or forms, and may not necessarily solve all problems.
        We are not aiming to be strictly prescriptive here. However, it would put
        the scholarly record keeping firmly back into our own hands, and not in the
        hands of commercial ownership, though any kind of solution can include some
        commercial service providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;
        style-setting/XML). It would also enable us to give more attention to other
        issues, like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8\" target=\"_blank\">challenges
        associated with peer review</a>. Taking such steps would be difficult, but
        we believe that the international science community is ready, and that there
        is more to gain through technological innovation.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><span

        /><p>In this blog post, we&#039;ll introduce you to the CWTS ECR/PhD Council,
        shedding light on its significance, objectives, and how it can serve as a
        crucial resource for early career researchers and PhDs at CWTS.</p><p>CWTS
        is an interdisciplinary institute at Leiden University with a diverse multinational
        academic culture. PhD candidates, early career researchers, and visiting scholars
        from around the world gather at CWTS to pursue their research journeys. The
        journey can be an inspiring yet challenging experience. It might be filled
        with research, innovation, and personal growth, but it can also be a journey
        that feels isolating at times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers
        need to spend extended periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of
        detachment from the broader social and academic community. Loneliness can
        be particularly challenging for our PhD candidates, early career researchers
        and visiting researchers who have transitioned to a new, unfamiliar environment.
        To counter this and to create a dynamic and supportive community, in September,
        we have started an Early Career Researcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two
        of us, Qianqian Xie as the Chair and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member,
        in the lead.</p><h3> What does it mean to be a PhD candidate or early career
        researcher?</h3><p>There is more to being a PhD candidate than just obtaining
        a degree. It assumes full involvement in the research process, from generating
        ideas to implementing them practically. The research process includes not
        only conducting research but also actively participating in academic events
        such as seminars, conferences, symposia, and round tables. Here, PhD candidates
        can exchange experiences with peers, discuss their ideas, and become familiar
        with new methods and approaches in their field of knowledge.</p><p>Being a
        PhD candidate also entails constant self-development and self-education. It
        is necessary to continuously update one's knowledge, monitor new trends and
        discoveries in their field. Ultimately, all of this contributes to the development
        of the PhD candidates\u2019 professional skills, their readiness for independent
        research activities, and successful careers.</p><p>To some extent, the same
        holds true for early career researchers \u2013 not only the PhD candidates.
        Early career researchers are people taking their first steps in a academic
        career. They have a fresh and critical view of the world, full of energy and
        desire to contribute to the development of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues
        are doing research without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we
        need to include them as well, since some of their struggles are the same.
        </p><p>To provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we established
        the ECR/PhD Council.</p><h3>What is the ECR/PhD Council?</h3><p>The ECR/PhD
        Council is a small, dedicated body (currently consisting of two members) within
        CWTS that brings together PhDs and early career researchers. The Council is
        committed to the promotion of internal communication, coordination of supportive
        and networking activities, and social cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community.
        At the same time, the Council is the formal connection between the ECRs and
        PhDs and the CWTS PhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.</p><h3>What
        are we planning to do?</h3><ul><li>Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing
        an ECR/PhD can often feel like a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers
        a supportive community where individuals can connect, share experiences, and
        provide emotional support to one another. The Council members also take the
        lead in organizing non-academic related meetings and informal ECR/PhD moments,
        to provide support for the well-being and social needs of individuals beyond
        their academic pursuits. For instance, introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD
        candidates and discussing challenges met during the PhD trajectory. Every
        two months we will have informal ECR/PhD moments (on-site), including drinks
        and pub-quizzes. </li><li>Academic Networking Opportunities: The Council provides
        a platform for networking with peers, mentors and potential collaborators,
        opening doors to new research opportunities. The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD
        internal seminars. These meetings will be held in hybrid format and in English
        to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD candidates may present and discuss
        academic work (proposals, results, papers, posters). We are also delighted
        to announce that the Council hosts farewell meetings for early career researchers,
        providing them with the opportunity to present the research they have conducted
        during their time at CWTS. Of course, this event is not mandatory but highly
        encouraged.</li><li>Buddy system: New CWTS PhD candidates are now offered
        the opportunity to be paired with a senior CWTS PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd
        year PhD candidate). External PhD candidates will also benefit from this system.
        </li><li>Providing insights to the CWTS Management Board. </li></ul><ol></ol><h3>What
        has happened so far?</h3><p>Our experience of joining the ECR/PhD Council
        has been great so far! It\u2019s not just about attending meetings and organizing
        events. It\u2019s all about being part of a supportive and dynamic academic
        community. Here\u2019s what the experience has been like:</p><ul><li>Community
        Building:  We\u2019ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow PhD students
        and early career researcher from various fields, which has broadened our perspective.
        </li><li>Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered
        by the council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our knowledge
        base. </li><li>Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice
        our needs and concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It\u2019s
        empowering to know that our interests are being represented.</li><li>Collaboration
        and Leadership: We\u2019ve already been encouraged to take on leadership roles
        within the council, which we hope will allow us to develop leadership and
        teamwork skills.  </li></ul><p>On October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its
        first welcoming meeting, at which the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc
        had a chance to introduce their research. The chairman of the Council also
        introduced all issues relevant to do a PhD at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services
        offered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses, etc.). Even though the meeting
        took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened. On the contrary, the meeting
        was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.<br></p><figure><img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"
        alt=\"Welcoming event photo\"><figcaption>First welcoming event organised
        by the ECR/PhD Council.</figcaption></figure><p>After the meeting, the council
        prepared food for all participants, and one of our colleagues even taught
        others how to roll spring rolls. It was not only a fascinating cultural experience
        but also an excellent way to strengthen relationships.<br></p><p>If you would
        like to share your experience on how PhD activities are organized in your
        institution or if you have any questions, you can reach us via ecrphd@cwts.leidenuniv.nl!</p><br><p><span

        the evolution of prize cultures over time and examine the current and potential
        roles of prizes in contemporary scientific practices. I would like to thank
        Ad Maas, Curator of Modern Natural Sciences of Rijksmuseum Boerhaave and professor
        in Museological Aspects of the Natural Sciences at the Centre for the Arts
        in Society of Leiden University, for inviting me to give a comment on the
        second day of the symposium. This blog post is an adaptation of the talk I
        gave there.<em></em><em></em></p><p><em>Does science need heroes?</em> Spoken
        like a proper academic, my answer to this question would be: yes and no.</p><p>Let
        me start with the latter.</p><p>No, the last thing contemporary science needs
        are heroes. What it does need is structural reform. Science suffers from major
        flaws, including various forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency
        and rigor, excessive competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.
        It is unhealthy for researchers to want to be a hero in the current system.</p><p>But
        also: yes! Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science system needs
        to reform, we need different types of people who can lead the way and set
        an example with good leadership. This is what I want to address in this commentary.</p><figure

        and inspired by Museum Boerhaave's wonderful collection, I will go back to
        the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when the first university ranking was conceived.
        People often think the first ranking appeared around the 2000s, with the publication
        of the first commercial ranking. But that is not true. As is more often the
        case, problematic metrics for assessing excellence are in fact invented by
        scientists themselves!</p><p>A few years ago, I examined the work of the American
        psychologist James McKeen Cattell <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf\"
        target=\"_blank\">with two of my colleagues</a>. Cattell lived from 1860 to
        1944, served as the long-time editor of the journal <em>Science</em>, and
        his primary academic interest was the study of 'eminence', a somewhat ambiguous
        concept that I translate here as excellence, eminence, or greatness. There
        is an interesting connection between Cattell's work on 'eminence' as the primary
        'virtue' of individual researchers and the contemporary university rankings
        of the most prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning universities
        with the most flourishing research and best teaching environments.</p><p>Cattell
        studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where he eventually
        came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell, and many other contemporaries
        interested in 'eminence' or greatness, observed a decrease in the number of
        'great men' compared to earlier periods, which they found concerning. They
        feared the biological degeneration of the population, and this fear was exacerbated
        by a more general concern about the decline of the British Empire. This fear
        was further intensified by the rise of industrialization, democratization,
        and a growing working class. The preoccupation with 'great men' was also reflected
        in a growing interest in the role of the scientist in a time when scientific
        work increasingly became a 'profession' among other professions. The scientific
        method of eugenics gave Cattell the tools to classify 'eminence' in a new
        way. His idea was that professors could be placed on a single ranked list
        based on peer review. He asked a large number of scientists to create a list,
        ranking scientists from the most to the least prominent, based on a selection
        of names provided in advance. High \"output\" was insufficient as an indicator
        of 'eminence'; it was primarily about reputation among peers. What exactly
        this reputation was based on remained ambiguous. Cattell kept various background
        and biographical information about the men on the lists, including data on
        birthplace, residence, age, and especially the university where researchers
        had received their education. But his lists also quickly started to serve
        other purposes: he mapped how 'scientific eminence' was distributed across
        cities and universities. And I quote from a piece in 1903: \"We can tell whether
        the average scientific standard in one part of the country or at a certain
        university is higher or lower than elsewhere; we can also quantitatively map
        the scientific strength of a university or department.\" So, initially, Cattell's
        lists were not compiled with the purpose of comparing institutions, but the
        information these instruments provided was indeed used for these comparisons.</p><figure

        universities in a single year</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>Cattell's
        study of scientific men and his subsequent ranking of universities was deeply
        rooted in a larger debate about the role of the scientist. The ideal image
        of a researcher was evolving significantly at the end of the 19th and the
        beginning of the 20th century, as I think is happening again today. But back
        then, older ideas about the gentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation,
        were increasingly juxtaposed with ideals that were more in line with the concept
        of science as a paid profession. Just as the current preoccupation with excellence
        and ranking is related to a much broader discussion about what universities
        are exactly for today! </p><p></p><p>Over the past 30+ years the Dutch and
        European governments have introduced several different policy instruments
        to foster excellent research. These policy instruments worked by stimulating
        competition in science, and what I find very interesting is how these research
        policy instruments have in the past decades started to shape our perception
        of excellent science through an interactive feedback loop between policy on
        the one hand and the practice of doing research on the other. An excellent
        researcher\u2019s standing is now primarily determined by their research production.
        This is partly still science as a profession that Cattell and others instigated,
        but this profession is now saturated with key performance indicators (like
        a lot of other professions in neoliberal democratic societies). The primary
        tactical and strategic aims have become competing for (ever decreasing amounts
        of) research income, and publishing in prestigious journals, and aiming for
        a Nobel Prize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards have become important
        parts of academic CVs. And because of gender and other diversity gaps, this
        makes it harder for women and other minority groups to make a career in science.
        University rankings use prizes and awards as input, and this trickles down
        in university policies. Universities over the past decades have started to
        think in terms of globalised economic markets for excellent researchers.</p><p>The
        motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one point made sense,
        and Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously, and this is
        not often acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with the way we measure
        excellence. If we are truly honest: current notions of excellence and metrics-driven
        assessment criteria are threatening to shape the content of the work and the
        diversity of the subject matter. We are observing that research is designed
        and adjusted in a way that ensures a good score. We see that people are choosing
        research questions not just based on interest or importance, but also to improve
        their chances of getting a job. This <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574\"
        target=\"_blank\">\u2018thinking with indicators\u2019</a> is obviously problematic
        for science when important research questions are not being addressed and
        even become \u2018unthinkable\u2019.</p><p>This type of thinking also has
        consequences for the space in academia for what you could call \u2018social\u2019
        elements. Think of decreasing collegiality, less commitment to the community,
        or bad leadership. And if we're mostly noticing and applauding the 'big names,'
        those veteran academics with a significant reputation, we are hurting the
        opportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who play crucial
        roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is so high that
        ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday because otherwise
        their work will be \u2018scooped\u2019. Competitiveness can create feelings
        of constant failure among early career researchers, as they may never feel
        they meet the required standards. And even those who are at the top, and we
        have interviewed many, often feel they must continue to work ever harder to
        keep out-competing others. Group leaders and heads of department warn each
        other about the health risks that they run by chronically working very hard,
        year after year. This is an actual quote from an actual interview:<br></p><p>The
        example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour \r\nto their
        younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a \r\nweek, and
        that if people can\u2019t keep up, they are not fit for the \r\nChampions
        League. These senior researchers have really internalised that\r\n this is
        what it takes to play the game, and that if you can\u2019t stand the\r\n heat,
        you should get out of the kitchen. But let\u2019s face it, that \r\nkitchen
        is on fire.</p><p>For one, we have globally had several severe integrity and
        \r\nreproducibility crises. We have seen the shadow side of competition, \r\nwhere
        researchers focus too much on finding new things and trying to do \r\nthat
        quickly, even if that means that they might not be doing \r\nhigh-quality
        research. Of course, we all want to tell our students to \r\ndream big and
        ideally, we also provide them with the protected space to \r\ndevelop their
        own research and strive for the highest quality. However, \r\nif in the meantime
        we also encourage them to focus on chasing after \r\ngroundbreaking results
        and judge success mainly by how many times our \r\nwork gets cited by others,
        we create a culture where short-termism and \r\nrisk aversion thrive. This
        culture is today also driven by a pressure to\r\n secure funding in competitive
        four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\r\n very hard for researchers to
        do long-term, risky projects, or work in \r\nfields that have a big impact
        on society but don't get cited as much, \r\nlike applied sciences or social
        sciences. As a result, research agendas \r\ndon't always focus on what society
        really needs. Also, all this \r\ncompetition can make scientists less likely
        to collaborate, which is \r\ncrucial for solving complex problems. </p><p>To
        make science better, we need to change our priorities, and support\r\n a wider
        range of research. We very urgently need more diverse \r\nperspectives and
        inclusive participation in science. <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/\"
        target=\"_blank\">We need to collaborate and open up,</a>\r\n simply because
        what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the \r\nproblem-solving
        capacity of science alone. And that is why we also \r\nreally need to rethink
        the criteria for excellent research. These \r\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
        because research evaluation has the \r\npower to affect the culture of research;
        individual career trajectories \r\nand researchers\u2019 well-being; the quality
        of evidence informing policy \r\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in
        research and research \r\nfunding.</p><p>I would also like to address a misunderstanding
        about the Dutch <a href=\"https://recognitionrewards.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018recognition
        and rewards\u2019 program</a>.\r\n I often hear a concern that the program
        wants to wishy-washily include \r\neveryone and forgets about upholding excellence.
        I do not think that \r\nthis is a fair portrayal of the program. At its core,
        the program is \r\nabout an honest look in the mirror, and about fixing what
        is broken. The\r\n program is part of a much larger set of national, regional,
        and global \r\ninitiatives including the <a href=\"https://sfdora.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DORA

        initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think \r\nevaluation. And we
        need other types of leaders and heroes in academia, \r\nwho will work together
        to implement responsible forms of research \r\nassessment. We should stop
        sending each other the message that \r\nregardless of how hard we all work,
        there is always more we need to do \r\nto succeed. If we want our work to
        be meaningful, we need to invest more\r\n in building strong academic communities
        that value collaboration and \r\nshare a commitment to advancing research
        and teaching, while making a \r\npositive impact on and with society.</p><p>One
        of my heroes in life is Pippi Langstr\xF6m, or Pippie Langkous in \r\nDutch.
        I used to watch her show when I was little. Pippi has this \r\nsaying: \u201CI
        have never tried this before, so I think I should definitely \r\nbe able to
        do that.\u201D I love it. And I believe that we need to reward \r\nthis type
        of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We \r\nshould foster
        taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our \r\ncomfort zone,
        and being bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously. \r\nBut in fact,
        we see the opposite happen among early career researchers. \r\nMany of them
        suffer from <a href=\"https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306_Improving-mental-health-of-early-career-researchers-2.pdf\"
        target=\"_blank\">anxiety and an unhealthy pressure to conform to a problematic

      "![](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/_articleThumb/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_header.png)\n\nIn
      this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open\napproach for
      classifying research publications, contributing to a\nbroader development toward
      open approaches to bibliometrics.\n\nClassifying research publications into
      research topics or research areas\nis crucial for many bibliometric analyses.
      While there are lots of\napproaches for classifying publications, most of these
      approaches lack\ntransparency. Although there are exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|
      resolution_micro_level | 2.2e-6  |\n| resolution_meso_level  | 4.9e-7  |\n|
      resolution_macro_level | 2.2e-8  |\n| threshold_micro_level  |  1,000  |\n|  threshold_meso_level  |
      10,000  |\n| threshold_macro_level  | 500,000 |\n|      n_iterations      |   100   |\n\n[Table
      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      Summary     | This cluster of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying

      this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open\napproach for
      classifying research publications, contributing to a\nbroader development toward
      open approaches to bibliometrics.\n\nClassifying research publications into
      research topics or research areas\nis crucial for many bibliometric analyses.
      While there are lots of\napproaches for classifying publications, most of these
      approaches lack\ntransparency. Although there are exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|
      resolution_micro_level | 2.2e-6  |\n| resolution_meso_level  | 4.9e-7  |\n|
      resolution_macro_level | 2.2e-8  |\n| threshold_micro_level  |  1,000  |\n|  threshold_meso_level  |
      10,000  |\n| threshold_macro_level  | 500,000 |\n|      n_iterations      |   100   |\n\n[Table
      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      Summary     | This cluster of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research
      evaluation, and the assessment of scientific impact. It covers topics such as

      assessment, altmetrics, co-authorship networks, and interdisciplinary research
      |\n| Wikipedia   | [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics){target=\"_blank\"}                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n[Table
      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      this post Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman introduce an open\napproach for
      classifying research publications, contributing to a\nbroader development toward
      open approaches to bibliometrics.\n\nClassifying research publications into
      research topics or research areas\nis crucial for many bibliometric analyses.
      While there are lots of\napproaches for classifying publications, most of these
      approaches lack\ntransparency. Although there are exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|

      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying
      research\npublications into research areas: Our approach relies on open data
      from\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\nclassification
      is [openly\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      work presented in this blog post is part of an [ambitious\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      have at CWTS to move to fully open approaches to bibliometrics, and\nto openness
      of research information and research analytics more\ngenerally.\n\nThe publication
      classification discussed in this blog post is a crucial\nbuilding block for
      the Open Edition of the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS is\ngoing to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the\nOpenAlex team as a foundation for a [new topic classification for\nOpenAlex](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      hope our work will help to advance the transition to open approaches\nto bibliometrics!  \n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications","updated":true,"category":"socialSciences"}]'

      Information & Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes\nopenness of
      research information. In this blog post, we present our\nagenda for the coming
      five years.\n\nHow to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic
      X? How to\nevaluate the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish\nnew
      strategic priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\nof the
      many important decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\nand science
      policy makers need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\nthese are increasingly
      made in data-driven ways, guided by research\nanalytics ranging from simple
      scientometric indicators and university\nrankings to complex dashboards that
      bring together data from a variety\nof sources.\n\n### The Information & Openness
      focal area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\n\nLast year the Information
      & Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\nIn this focal area we are concerned
      with the complex interplay between\ndecision making processes in science, the
      information used in these\nprocesses, and the nature of this information in
      terms of properties\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and ownership.
      This\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from two movements\nwith
      global aspirations: open science and responsible research\nassessment. Our work
      in the focal area builds on decades of experience\nwe have at CWTS in using
      scientometric data to support research\nassessment and strategic decision making
      in science. Having been at the\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\n\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\nof data in decision making processes in science. We are
      interested in\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and how
      these\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research information
      more\ngenerally.\n\n### **Three pillars**\n\nIn line with the organization of
      the\u00a0[broader knowledge agenda of\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width:
      100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\nbroad goal of
      developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\ninformation the norm and to
      enable more transparent and responsible\napproaches to decision making in science.
      An example is the\ntransformation of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\">CWTS\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\nresulting in a fully
      transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\nrelease of the Open Edition
      of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\nthis month, on January 30. Another
      example is the launch of the course<a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\"><em>Scientometrics\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\n<a href=\"https://openknowledge.community/\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\ncoming months.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\nfuture scientometric analyses performed
      by our center will use only data\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref, DataCite,
      ORCID, OpenAlex,\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part of a broader
      ambition\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the way we\ncommunicate
      about our research and about other activities of our center.\nThis will also
      include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\">open\nscience</a>
      and <a\nhref=\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\">research\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### **Our way of working**\n\nThe
      team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of more than\n20 CWTS
      colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities in\nthe understanding
      pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\npracticing pillars. We
      meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\ndevelopments around open research
      information, to share updates on\nongoing projects and other activities, and
      to make plans for new\ninitiatives.\n\nOur work also aims to contribute to strengthening
      the other two focal\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\nInclusion in
      Global\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\nOpenness and
      Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\nthe [GraspOS project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and the\n[CoARA working group on Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research\nAssessment\n(OI4RRA)](https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra){target=\"_blank\"}\ndemonstrates
      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\n\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\nresearch information
      into practice (e.g.,\n[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database){target=\"_blank\"},\n[COKI](https://open.coki.ac/){target=\"_blank\"},

      Information & Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes\\nopenness of
      research information. In this blog post, we present our\\nagenda for the coming
      five years.\\n\\nHow to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic
      X? How to\\nevaluate the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish\\nnew
      strategic priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\\nof the
      many important decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\\nand science
      policy makers need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\\nthese are increasingly
      made in data-driven ways, guided by research\\nanalytics ranging from simple
      scientometric indicators and university\\nrankings to complex dashboards that
      bring together data from a variety\\nof sources.\\n\\n### The Information &
      Openness focal area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\\n\\nLast year the
      Information & Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\\nIn this focal area
      we are concerned with the complex interplay between\\ndecision making processes
      in science, the information used in these\\nprocesses, and the nature of this
      information in terms of properties\\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness,
      and ownership. This\\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from
      two movements\\nwith global aspirations: open science and responsible research\\nassessment.
      Our work in the focal area builds on decades of experience\\nwe have at CWTS
      in using scientometric data to support research\\nassessment and strategic decision
      making in science. Having been at the\\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\\n\\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\\nof data in decision making processes in science. We
      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and
      how these\\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research
      information more\\ngenerally.\\n\\n### **Three pillars**\\n\\nIn line with the

      Information & Openness focal area at CWTS studies and promotes\\nopenness of
      research information. In this blog post, we present our\\nagenda for the coming
      five years.\\n\\nHow to find the most relevant scientific literature on topic
      X? How to\\nevaluate the research carried out by department Y? And how to establish\\nnew
      strategic priorities for university Z? These are just a few examples\\nof the
      many important decisions that researchers, research evaluators,\\nand science
      policy makers need to make on a daily basis. Decisions like\\nthese are increasingly
      made in data-driven ways, guided by research\\nanalytics ranging from simple
      scientometric indicators and university\\nrankings to complex dashboards that
      bring together data from a variety\\nof sources.\\n\\n### The Information &
      Openness focal area {#the-information-openness-focal-area}\\n\\nLast year the
      Information & Openness focal area was established at CWTS.\\nIn this focal area
      we are concerned with the complex interplay between\\ndecision making processes
      in science, the information used in these\\nprocesses, and the nature of this
      information in terms of properties\\nsuch as openness, transparency, inclusiveness,
      and ownership. This\\ncomplex interplay is subject to ongoing disruption from
      two movements\\nwith global aspirations: open science and responsible research\\nassessment.
      Our work in the focal area builds on decades of experience\\nwe have at CWTS
      in using scientometric data to support research\\nassessment and strategic decision
      making in science. Having been at the\\nforefront of developments in scientometrics,
      we not only have a lot of\\nknowledge about scientometric data sources, indicators,
      and algorithms,\\nbut we also have a deep understanding of the role scientometrics
      plays\\nin all kinds of decision-making processes.\\n\\nBuilding on our experience
      and recognizing that decisions in science are\\nincreasingly being made in data-driven
      ways, the Information & Openness\\nfocal area aims to study and promote responsible
      approaches to the use\\nof data in decision making processes in science. We
      are interested in\\nthe properties of the data sources that are being used and
      how these\\nproperties contribute to, or impede, responsible ways of decision\\nmaking.
      The field of scientometrics has a long tradition of working with\\nproprietary
      data sources, especially Web of Science and Scopus. However,\\nthe closed nature
      of these data sources is increasingly seen as an\\nobstacle to transparent and
      responsible decision making, for instance in\\nthe context of research assessment.
      In the Information & Openness focal\\narea we are therefore particularly interested
      in studying and promoting\\nopenness of scientometric data, and of research
      information more\\ngenerally.\\n\\n### **Three pillars**\\n\\nIn line with the
      organization of the\_[broader knowledge agenda of\\nCWTS](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nour
      work in the Information & Openness focal area is organized in three\\npillars:
      understanding, intervening, and practicing. In the box below we\\noutline our
      plans for each of these pillars.\\n\\n<table>\\n<colgroup>\\n<col style=\\\"width:
      100%\\\" />\\n</colgroup>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\\\"odd\\\">\\n<td><p><strong>Understanding</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the understanding pillar we perform research projects with the\\nbroad goal
      of developing a comprehensive and critical understanding of\\nthe open research
      information landscape. Based on our scientometric\\nexpertise, some projects
      in this pillar may focus on systematically\\nmonitoring and tracking the availability
      of open research information.\\nDrawing on our expertise in sociology, anthropology,
      and science and\\ntechnology studies, other projects may be aimed at describing
      and\\nexplaining what shapes, enables, and constrains the spread, or\\nnon-spread,
      of open information practices.</p>\\n<p><strong>Intervening</strong></p>\\n<p>In
      the intervening pillar we take concrete actions to advance\\nopenness of research
      information, aiming to make openness of research\\ninformation the norm and
      to enable more transparent and responsible\\napproaches to decision making in
      science. An example is the\\ntransformation of the <a href=\\\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\\\">CWTS\\nLeiden
      Ranking</a> to a tool that is entirely based on open data,\\nresulting in a
      fully transparent and reproducible ranking. The first\\nrelease of the Open
      Edition of the Leiden Ranking will take place later\\nthis month, on January
      30. Another example is the launch of the course<a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/scientometrics-using-open-data\\\"><em>Scientometrics\\nUsing
      Open Data</em></a>, in close collaboration with colleagues at the\\n<a href=\\\"https://openknowledge.community/\\\">Curtin
      Open Knowledge\\nInitiative (COKI)</a>. The first edition of this course took
      place in\\nNovember last year, and a next edition will be organized in March
      this\\nyear. Other actions to advance openness of research information are\\ncurrently
      in preparation. We expect to share some announcements in the\\ncoming months.</p>\\n<p><strong>Practicing</strong></p>\\n<p>Following
      the idea of \u2018practice what we preach\u2019, the practicing\\npillar focuses
      on implementing openness of research information in our\\nown way of working
      at CWTS. Within the next few years, we want our work\\nat CWTS (including <a
      href=\\\"https://cwtsbv.nl/\\\">CWTS BV</a>) to be fully\\nbased on open research
      information. In particular, our aim is that\\nfuture scientometric analyses
      performed by our center will use only data\\nfrom open sources, such as Crossref,
      DataCite, ORCID, OpenAlex,\\nOpenCitations, OpenAIRE, and others. This is part
      of a broader ambition\\nto open up the work we do at CWTS, for instance in the
      way we\\ncommunicate about our research and about other activities of our center.\\nThis
      will also include a revision and expansion of our policies for <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-open-science-policy\\\">open\\nscience</a>
      and <a\\nhref=\\\"https://www.cwts.nl/research/cwts-research-data-management-guidelines\\\">research\\ndata
      management</a>.</p></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\n### **Our way of
      working**\\n\\nThe team of the Information & Openness focal area consists of
      more than\\n20 CWTS colleagues. Some of us are focused primarily on activities
      in\\nthe understanding pillar. Others are more focused on the intervening or\\npracticing
      pillars. We meet once every two weeks to discuss the latest\\ndevelopments around
      open research information, to share updates on\\nongoing projects and other
      activities, and to make plans for new\\ninitiatives.\\n\\nOur work also aims
      to contribute to strengthening the other two focal\\nareas of CWTS: [Engagement
      &\\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      Evaluation & Culture. Through the [UNESCO Lab on Diversity and\\nInclusion in
      Global\\nScience](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nwe
      for instance connect some of the work we do in the Information &\\nOpenness
      and Engagement & Inclusion focal areas. Likewise, our work in\\nthe [GraspOS
      project](https://graspos.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} and the\\n[CoARA working
      group on Open Infrastructures for Responsible Research\\nAssessment\\n(OI4RRA)](https://graspos.eu/?view=article&id=72:coara-wg-oi4rra){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
      the value of cross fertilization between the Information &\\nOpenness and Evaluation
      & Culture focal areas.\\n\\nWe are also setting up collaborations with external
      partners working on\\nopen research information. Many organizations are doing
      crucial work in\\nthis area. This ranges from research groups that study openness
      of\\nresearch information to organizations that provide infrastructures for\\nopen
      research information and organizations that put the use of open\\nresearch information
      into practice (e.g.,\\n[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrsinfo/cnrs-has-unsubscribed-scopus-publications-database){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\n[COKI](https://open.coki.ac/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      "![](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/_articleThumb/Understanding-Misinformation-and-Science-in-Societal-Debates-header.png)\n\nIn
      a new research project, we explore the interaction between\nmisinformation and
      science on social media during COVID-19. This is part\nof the new research line
      on the role of science in societal debates of\nour Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\n\nThe
      past years have shown that science can play an important role in\nsocietal debates.
      Science was clearly pivotal in the development of\nCOVID-19 vaccines. In addition,
      many of the interventions and policies,\nsuch as masking, school closures or
      even curfews, were presented as\nevidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific
      advances in our\nunderstanding of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific\nfindings
      were part of broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal\nproponents and
      opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised\nsettings. Although very visible
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\nalso plays a large role in other societal
      debates, such as [the nitrogen\ndebate in the\nNetherlands](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180){target=\"_blank\"},\nor
      [climate\nchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climate_change_controversies){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs
      a part of our [Focal Area of Engagement &\nInclusion](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-focal-area-engagement-and-inclusion-a-vision-and-roadmap){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      CWTS, we explore the role of science in societal debates. We know\nthat [science
      does not offer unequivocal facts for societal debates or\nclear course of action
      for\npolic](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308){target=\"_blank\"}[y](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-do-governments-ever-truly-listen-to-the-science-134308).\nSome
      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\ndebates,
      are different \"sides\" informed by different literatures,\nperhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a\ncommon evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead\nto a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open\navailability of scientific literature shape the
      role of science in\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific\nresults differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?\nHow
      do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\n\nIn addition to
      science, misinformation also plays a large role in\nsocietal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak of an\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\nfact-checkers, such
      as\n[maldita.es](https://maldita.es/){target=\"_blank\"} in Spain, or the\nlocal
      \"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\"\nhere at
      Leiden University. There are also campaigns to raise awareness\nby the public,
      such as \"[Ask for\nEvidence](https://askforevidence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}\"
      or \"[Stop,\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\"_blank\"}\",
      to help\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact
      with\nmisinformation?\n\n### Science and misinformation\n\nWe are excited to
      start a new project on [Understanding Misinformation\nand Science in Societal
      Debates\n(UnMiSSeD)](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects/unmissed){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn
      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous
      boundaries of\nsocial media. We will collaborate with Fondazione Bruno Kessler
      (FBK),\nlead by [Riccardo\nGallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team#h.4rhone98mox8){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\nUniversity of Geneva, lead by [Tommaso\nVenturini](http://www.tommasoventurini.it/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We are\nhappy that this project is supported by the [European Media and\nInformation\nFund](https://gulbenkian.pt/emifund/projects/understanding-misinformation-and-science-in-societal-debates-unmissed/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      New perspective\n\nAt CWTS, we already have previous experience with studying
      [connections\nbetween science and\nsociety](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24427){target=\"_blank\"},
      also in\nthe context of\n[COVID-19](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/delineating-covid-19-and-coronavirus-research-an-analysis-of-the-cord-19-dataset){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also studied how COVID-19 appeared in [a media\noutlet](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/exploring-the-covid-19-discourse-in-the-conversation){target=\"_blank\"}.\nMuch
      of our knowledge on science in social media is based on data from\n[Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      and provides a\ngood lens on which aspects of academic publications relate to
      being\nmentioned on (social) media. Previous projects at CWTS departed from\nscience
      and explored where science was mentioned, referenced and taken\nup. However,
      this approach misses the broader contexts in which science\nis mentioned. Societal
      debates are multifaceted processes [where\nscientific mentions are couched in
      and interact with other ways of\nknowing the world](http://modesofexistence.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      In\nthe UnMiSSeD project, our starting point are societal debates\nthemselves.
      We explore when and how science becomes part of such\ndebates, also in relation
      to misinformation and claims unrelated to\nscience. In this way, we hope to
      better understand the role of science\nand misinformation in societal debates.\n\nThis
      project brings together a novel combination of scientific fields at\nCWTS. Traditionally,
      our centre is more focused on science (and\ntechnology) studies. The UnMiSSeD
      project brings in not only\ncomputational social sciences but also media and
      communication studies\nand has clear connections to science communication. We
      hope to build out\nthese connections in the near future. Watch this blog for
      future updates\non our project. We are open to explore new opportunities, and
      if you\nwant to connect to us on this topic, please do [reach\nout](mailto:v.a.traag@cwts.leidenuniv.nl){target=\"_blank\"}!  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Understanding-Misinformation-and-Science-in-Societal-Debates.png\"\ndata-image=\"38728\"

      Science was clearly pivotal in the development of\nCOVID-19 vaccines. In addition,
      many of the interventions and policies,\nsuch as masking, school closures or
      even curfews, were presented as\nevidence-based solutions, motivated by scientific
      advances in our\nunderstanding of the virus. In return, these policies and scientific\nfindings
      were part of broader societal debates, with sometimes vocal\nproponents and
      opponents in contentious and sometimes polarised\nsettings. Although very visible
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, science\nalso plays a large role in other societal
      debates, such as [the nitrogen\ndebate in the\nNetherlands](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.366.6470.1180){target=\"_blank\"},\nor

      of the questions that guide our research line include: in societal\ndebates,
      are different \"sides\" informed by different literatures,\nperhaps reinforcing
      their own convictions? Or do different sides share a\ncommon evidence base from
      science? Does new scientific information lead\nto a convergence or to a divergence
      of opinions? Does the open\navailability of scientific literature shape the
      role of science in\nsocietal debates? Do scientists and societal actors interpret
      scientific\nresults differently? How are these interpretations used in arguments?\nHow
      do scientists themselves engage in such societal debates?\n\nIn addition to
      science, misinformation also plays a large role in\nsocietal debates. During
      COVID-19, this prompted the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) to speak of an\n[infodemic](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic){target=\"_blank\"}.\nSome
      of the misinformation might be countered, for example, by\nfact-checkers, such

      \"[Nieuwscheckers](https://nieuwscheckers.nl/){target=\"_blank\"}\"\nhere at

      or \"[Stop,\nThink, Check](https://www.bemediasmart.ie/){target=\"_blank\"}\",
      to help\nprevent the spread of misinformation. But how does science interact

      this project, we will study the interaction between misinformation\nand science
      during the COVID-19 pandemic using both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches.
      Our quantitative analyses will be limited to\nTwitter (now X), based on more
      than a billion tweets posted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, combined with information
      on millions of publications\nand tweets about them. We will go beyond Twitter
      in our qualitative\nanalyses to explore how discussions permeate the porous

      September 2023, the city of Leiden in the Netherlands was the venue\nfor not
      just one, but two scientometrics-related events: the CWTS\nScientometrics Summer
      School and the STI 2023 conference. Our author\nattended both and reflects on
      his experience.\n\nGreetings from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes, where
      I find\nmyself reflecting on two transformative events in my scientific journey:\nthe
      CWTS Scientometrics Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\nConference
      on Science, Technology, and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\nAs a bibliometrics
      enthusiast for the past two decades, this experience\nhas been nothing short
      of a revelation---a journey that prompted me to\nquestion the very fabric of
      scientific evaluation and metrics.\n\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics
      was marked by conventional\nsurvey field research. Fast forward ten years, and
      I realized the\nuntapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library and
      Information\nScience (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the\ncontroversial
      realm of the h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the\nscientific output
      of Peruvian researchers. The journey took a pivotal\nturn in 2015 when I attended
      the \"Measuring Science and Research\nPerformance\"\u00a0course at CWTS in Leiden,
      a week that unraveled the\nlimitations and detrimental consequences associated
      with relying on the\nh-index for critical decisions like research grants or
      promotions.\n\nWhy the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely contested
      journal\nimpact factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet frequently\nmisused
      bibliometric indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\nbibliometric studies,
      I couldn\\''t ignore the grim reality in many South\nAmerican countries---bibliometric
      reports often perpetuate the status\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\n\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\ntransparency and accessibility, often fell
      short. Discussions on\nalternative indicators typically revolve around metrics
      tied to\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While open-access\npublishing
      dominates the discourse on open science practices, few\nconsider the potential
      of data sharing and code transparency: for\nexample, sharing bibliographic datasets
      or the R/Stata codes essential\nfor transparent data analysis.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/day-2-vevrvolg-11.jpg\"\nalt=\"Day
      2 vevrvolg 11\" />\n<figcaption>The author presenting at the STI 2023\nconference.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nEight
      years after my inaugural visit to Leiden, I had the privilege of\nreturning
      to participate in the\n[CS3](https://www.cwts.nl/education/cwts-course-program/cwts-scientometrics-summer-school-2023){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [STI 2023](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"}. These\nevents were
      crucibles of intellectual exchange, where I encountered a\nwealth of perspectives
      that ignited new possibilities for my own\nresearch journey. The incorporation
      of insights from the sociology of\nscience and science and technology studies
      (STS) offered a refreshing\nlens, challenging us to move beyond mere numbers
      and delve into the\nsocial and cultural contexts that shape scientific knowledge
      production.\nExploring diverse information sources, beyond the confines of\nestablished
      databases, promised a more nuanced understanding of\nscientific impact, particularly
      in regions often marginalized by\ntraditional bibliometric approaches.\n\nBut
      most importantly, the shared experiences and diverse perspectives of\ncolleagues
      from across the globe truly resonated. The STI 2023\nconference brought together
      Global North and South voices, bridging the\ngap between established research
      powerhouses and emerging scientific\necosystems. Through open dialogue and critical
      reflection, we began to\ndismantle the monolithic assumptions that often underpin

      September 2023, the city of Leiden in the Netherlands was the venue\\nfor not
      just one, but two scientometrics-related events: the CWTS\\nScientometrics Summer
      School and the STI 2023 conference. Our author\\nattended both and reflects
      on his experience.\\n\\nGreetings from Peru, nestled in the heart of the Andes,
      where I find\\nmyself reflecting on two transformative events in my scientific
      journey:\\nthe CWTS Scientometrics Summer School (CS^3^) and the 27th International\\nConference
      on Science, Technology, and Innovation Indicators (STI 2023).\\nAs a bibliometrics
      enthusiast for the past two decades, this experience\\nhas been nothing short
      of a revelation---a journey that prompted me to\\nquestion the very fabric of
      scientific evaluation and metrics.\\n\\nTwo decades ago, my foray into bibliometrics
      was marked by conventional\\nsurvey field research. Fast forward ten years,
      and I realized the\\nuntapped potential of bibliometrics in advancing Library
      and Information\\nScience (LIS). My maiden bibliometric study delved into the\\ncontroversial
      realm of the h-index, assessing its utility in gauging the\\nscientific output
      of Peruvian researchers. The journey took a pivotal\\nturn in 2015 when I attended
      the \\\"Measuring Science and Research\\nPerformance\\\"\_course at CWTS in
      Leiden, a week that unraveled the\\nlimitations and detrimental consequences
      associated with relying on the\\nh-index for critical decisions like research
      grants or promotions.\\n\\nWhy the focus on the h-index? Because, like the widely
      contested journal\\nimpact factor, it stands as one of the most popular yet
      frequently\\nmisused bibliometric indicators. Over almost a decade of dedicated\\nbibliometric
      studies, I couldn\\\\'t ignore the grim reality in many South\\nAmerican countries---bibliometric
      reports often perpetuate the status\\nquo, hindering scientific progress. Indicators,
      meant to guide and\\ninform, had become perverse incentives. Researchers, chasing
      elusive\\ncitations, prioritized studies that fit into pre-existing frameworks\\nrather
      than addressing pressing regional and local needs.\\n\\nEven workshops advocating
      for open science, while championing\\ntransparency and accessibility, often
      fell short. Discussions on\\nalternative indicators typically revolve around
      metrics tied to\\ndownloads or citations from open information sources. While
      open-access\\npublishing dominates the discourse on open science practices,
      few\\nconsider the potential of data sharing and code transparency: for\\nexample,

      was one of the key topics at the [Science, Technology and\nInnovation Indicators
      (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"} that CWTS\norganised
      in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science was\nnot only discussed
      at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe publication and peer
      review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate

      the STI 2023 conference, an experiment was performed with a more open\napproach
      to publication and peer review of conference submissions. In\nthis post, the
      conference organisers present an evaluation of this\nexperiment.\n\nOpen science
      was one of the key topics at the [Science, Technology and\nInnovation Indicators
      (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"} that CWTS\norganised
      in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science was\nnot only discussed
      at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe publication and peer
      review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating

      the STI 2023 conference, an experiment was performed with a more open\napproach
      to publication and peer review of conference submissions. In\nthis post, the
      conference organisers present an evaluation of this\nexperiment.\n\nOpen science
      was one of the key topics at the [Science, Technology and\nInnovation Indicators
      (STI)\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/){target=\"_blank\"} that CWTS\norganised
      in September 2023 in Leiden, the Netherlands. Open science was\nnot only discussed
      at the conference but was also put into practice in\nthe publication and peer
      review process of the conference. By way of\n[experiment](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/experimenting-with-open-science-practices-at-the-sti-2023-conference){target=\"_blank\"},\nall
      papers submitted to the conference were published as a preprint\nbefore they
      were peer reviewed. Moreover, the peer review process was\nopen: Review reports
      were published alongside the preprinted papers, and\nsome reviewers also chose
      to sign their reports.\n\nWhat did we learn from this experiment? To evaluate
      the experiment, we\ninvited all 186 authors of conference submissions to complete
      a brief\nanonymous survey ([survey\nform](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2LfQngGoy4IeVWy6lrl3VFdhDYgP8GI/view?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"};\n[survey\nresponses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmwCIJvzhf3yPWIJnbr3sQz0gALeL5I7HkmUqh5PzFY/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"}).\nSurvey
      invitations were sent after the conference. We received 93\nresponses, corresponding
      to a response rate of 50%. Below we discuss the\noutcomes of the survey.  \n\n###
      Preprinting\n\nWe first asked survey respondents to share their opinion about\npreprinting
      of conference submissions. Preprinting of conference\nsubmissions is strongly
      supported. 51% of the respondents selected the\nhighest score (5), indicating
      they \\\"like it a lot\\\", and an additional\n37% of the respondents selected
      the second-highest score (4). Only a\nsmall minority of 6% of the respondents
      do not support preprinting and\nselected the lowest (1; \\\"I don\\''t like
      it at all\\\") or second-lowest\n(2) score.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_1.png\"\ndata-image=\"37790\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nWhen asked what they see as advantages and disadvantages
      of preprinting\nof conference submissions, respondents indicated they appreciate
      the\nearly access and visibility of research through preprinting. The ability\nto
      receive feedback and engage with peers is also seen as an advantage.\nIn addition,
      preprinting enables researchers to establish priority on\nemerging topics. However,
      concerns revolve around the quality assurance\nof preprints, with worries that
      some submissions represent ongoing work\nthat still needs further development,
      in which case preprinting may\nundermine the credibility of the research. There
      is also a risk that\nearly-career researchers may feel pressured by the open
      nature of\npreprints.  \n\n### Open peer review\n\nSupport for open peer review
      is almost as strong as support for\npreprinting. 73% of the survey respondents
      expressed support for open\npeer review (score of 4 or 5). Only 14% of the respondents
      were opposed\nto open peer review (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_2.png\"\ndata-image=\"37805\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents recognized several advantages of open peer
      review, including\nenhanced transparency, constructive feedback, and accountability
      of\nreviewers. However, respondents expressed concerns about variations in\nreview
      quality and about the potential impact of negative reviews,\nespecially on early-career
      researchers. Some respondents indicated a\npreference for fully anonymous peer
      review, to make sure author\nidentities do not influence reviewers.  \n\n###
      Future editions of the STI conference\n\nSurvey respondents are very positive
      about the idea of adopting\npreprinting and open peer review at future editions
      of the STI\nconference. 76% of the respondents are in favor of this idea (score
      of 4\nor 5), while only 7% oppose the idea (score of 1 or 2).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_3.png\"\ndata-image=\"37820\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents also offered suggestions for improvement. They
      would value\nmore thorough reviews, increased transparency in the decision-making\nprocess,
      and well-defined evaluation criteria. Some respondents\nrecommended improving
      the selection and assignment of reviewers. Several\nrespondents felt there is
      a need to have a more user-friendly platform\nfor publishing and reviewing conference
      submissions.  \n\n### Strengths and weaknesses of the Orvium platform\n\nThe
      opinions of survey respondents about the [Orvium\nplatform](https://dapp.orvium.io/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which was used to\npublish and review conference submissions, are a bit more
      mixed. When\nasked about their satisfaction with the platform, 66% of the respondents\ngave
      a positive response (score 4 or 5). Only 8% gave a negative\nresponse (score
      1 or 2), but there is also a significant share of the\nrespondents (25%) that
      gave a neutral response (score of 3).\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/Preprinting-and-open-peer-review-at-the-STI-2023-conference_4.png\"\ndata-image=\"37843\"
      />\n</figure>\n\n  \nRespondents mentioned several strengths of the Orvium platform,\nincluding
      the platform\\''s ability to issue DOIs, support for having\nmultiple versions
      of a paper, and the generation of ''previews'' of papers\nfor convenient reading
      in a web browser. However, a number of weaknesses\nwere also mentioned. While
      some respondents considered the platform easy\nto use, others found that navigation
      was challenging and the interface\nconfusing. Respondents also reported problems
      with the platform\\''s\nsearch function.  \n\n### Impact of the STI 2023 conference
      on open science perspectives\n\nWe also asked survey respondents whether the
      STI 2023 conference changed\ntheir ideas about open science. Most respondents
      reported that their\nviews on open science remained largely unchanged, as they
      were already\nsupportive of open science. However, a significant share of the\nrespondents
      found that the conference reinforced their positive views of\nopen science.
      These respondents for instance mentioned that they\nappreciate the practical
      implementation of open science at the\nconference. At the same time, some respondents
      reported that the\nconference made them more aware of potential drawbacks of
      open science,\nsuch as information overload and problems in quality assurance\nprocesses.\n\n###
      Conclusion\n\nBased on the outcomes of the survey, we consider the experiment
      with\npreprinting and open peer review at the STI 2023 conference to be\nsuccessful.
      While some survey respondents are critical, a large majority\nof the respondents
      are positive about the experiment. Moreover, over\nthree-quarters of the respondents
      recommend that future editions of the\nSTI conference adopt preprinting and
      open peer review. The feedback\nprovided by respondents offers excellent guidance
      for making further\nimprovements to publication and peer review processes at
      the STI\nconference, hopefully enabling the full potential of open science to
      be\nrealized.\n\n*We dedicate this blog post to Leo Waaijers. Leo was a passionate
      open\nscience activist and a driving force behind the experiment discussed in\nthis

      next EASST-4S conference will take place in Amsterdam in July 2024.\nCWTS colleagues
      are involved in 9 open panels, showing the diversity of\ntopics studied at CWTS.
      In this blogpost, they give an overview of the\ndifferent panels and the topics
      that will be addressed.\n\nEvery four years the European Association for the
      Study of Science and\nTechnology (EASST) and the Society for Social Studies
      of Science (4S)\njoin forces to organize the largest conference in the field
      of Science\nand Technology Studies (STS) in the world. From 16 to 19 July, 2024
      [the\nconference](https://www.easst4s2024.net/){target=\"_blank\"} is hosted
      by\nthe Athena Institute in Amsterdam. The call for abstracts was recently\nlaunched
      with an impressive list of [397 open\npanels](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/){target=\"_blank\"}\nproposed
      by STS scholars from across the globe. There is an enormous\ndiversity of topics
      that are being addressed in the open panels and it\npromises to be an exciting
      conference!\n\nCWTS is among the larger centres in the field of STS in the Netherlands\nand
      we are proud to have CWTS colleagues involved in 9 panels. These\npanels show
      not only the diversity of topics in STS but also the\ndiversity of approaches
      and topics studied at CWTS. Below we present the\ndifferent panels we are involved
      in. We hope to receive your [abstract\nsubmissions](https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand/or
      see you in the audience in July!\n\nPanel number 009, called [*Marine Transformations:
      Exploring the\ntechnoscience behind our changing relationship with the\nseas*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#13973){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0is\norganized
      by Jackie Ashkin in collaboration with Sebastian Ureta\n(Universidad Cat\u00f3lica
      de Chile), Elis Jones (University of Exeter), and\nJose A. Ca\u00f1ada (University
      of Helsinki). This panel begins from the\nobservation that the world''s oceans
      are in peril. Human actions both\nthreaten and promise to save the ocean, but
      how do technoscientific\nenterprises contribute to transforming human-ocean
      relations? We invite\ncontributions which explore the more-than-human, technoscientific
      and\nethicopolitical dimensions of knowing and relating to the ocean.\n\nPanel
      number 071, simply entitled\n[*Seabirds*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14110){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Mayline Strouk (STIS, University of Edinburgh and CWTS)\nwith Bronte
      Evans Rayward (SPRI, University of Cambridge) and Oscar\nHartman Davies (University
      of Oxford). The Open Panel aims to gather\ncase studies and discussions on seabirds
      to engage with contemporary\nurgent matters such as environmental change and
      the Anthropocene. We\nseek to engage with STS topics such as technological developments,\nmultispecies
      and more-than-human studies, and space and its\nmaterialities. We welcome contributions
      focused on seabirds or where\nseabirds play an intriguing role in addressing
      socio-technical matters.\nWhat can seabirds teach us?\n\nPanel number 074 explores
      [*The limits of Open Research: critical views\nand new\nperspectives*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14113){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      is organized by Ismael Rafols and Louise Bezuidenhout. This open\npanel critically
      examines the Open Science (OS) movement and the\nenactment of its core values
      of equity, fairness, and inclusiveness. As\nthe OS infrastructural landscape
      evolves, there is an underlying\nassumption that these values will support the
      evolution of an equitable\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable science.
      Nonetheless,\nsimply assuming that these values are embedded in infrastructural
      design\ncan be viewed as problematic. These open panels will critically engage\nwith
      the dissonance between OS expectations and current enactment,\nraising questions
      relating to limits of openness, meaningful\nconnectivity and digital democratisation.\n\nPanel
      number 145, [*Scientific cultures in conflict and transition:\nStudying reform
      in\naction*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14191){target=\"_blank\"}*,*\naddresses
      the recent proliferation of science reform movements,\nincluding open science,
      meta-science, responsible research and\ninnovation, responsible metrics, and
      research ssessment reform. These\n''upstream'' reform movements seek to address
      what campaigners consider\ndeclining standards of quality or propriety around
      academic knowledge\nproduction, communication and evaluation within their own
      professional\nworld. This open panel is co-convened by our CWTS colleague Alex\nRushforth,
      together with Bart Penders (Maastricht University/Aachen\nUniversity), and Nicole
      Nelson (University of Wisconsin Madison). They\ninvite case study contributions
      on one or more scientific reform\nmovement(s) which advocate a specific view
      on the right way to conduct\nscientific practice(s).\n\nPanel number 154, entitled
      [*Making and Doing Oceanic Futures:\nMobilising the ocean and its materialities
      between hope and\nloss*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14200){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Francesco Colona, Sarah Rose Bieszczad and Judit Varga.\nThe Panel
      explores the ocean as an object of study and concern\u00a0in\nvarious knowledge
      and artistic practices. It queries how oceanic futures\nare entangled with hope
      and loss and how these futures intersect with\nsocio-political, scientific,
      economic, industrial, and ecological\nprocesses. This panel welcomes traditional
      presentations and artistic\ncontributions (e.g. performances, films, or spoken
      words), and invites\ninterventions about the ocean as an object of study and
      an object of\nconcern.  \n\nPanel number 299 aims to bring together studies
      of [*new notions of\nresearch\nquality*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14378){target=\"_blank\"}*.*\nVarious
      reform movements and science policy interventions have been\nadding new elements
      to conceptions of quality in research-performing\norganisations. Co-convened
      by Marta Sienkiewicz, Tjitske Holtrop and\nThed van Leeuwen from CWTS, the panel
      invites contributions bringing an\nSTS lens to the study of new quality notions,
      the reform movements that\nsupport them and the evaluative situations where
      they count. We seek to\ngenerate reflections of theoretical and practical significance
      for\n(e)valuation, standardisation and justification of quality in research\nassessments.
      The panel will combine academic presentations with an\ninteractive workshop.\n\nPanel
      number 328, entitled [*Excavating fossilized data: Problematizing\nties between
      academic research and polluting\nindustries*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14411){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      organized by Jorrit Smit and Sarah de Rijcke (CWTS) in collaboration\nwith former
      colleague Guus Dix (UTwente), as well as Shivant Jhagroe and\nDominika Czerniawska
      from other faculties of Leiden University. In this\npanel, we want to explore
      experimental ways for STS to engage with the\n\"cut the ties\" debate around
      campuses worldwide. We aim to host a\nmethodologically diverse gathering in
      which we can collectively\n''excavate'' data and address pivotal political-epistemic
      effects of ties\nbetween extractivist polluting industries and academic research
      in times\nof climate crisis.\n\nPanel 340 develops the notion of [*More-than
      human research and\nInnovation*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14424){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is organized by Thomas Franssen (CWTS), Rob Smith (University of\nEdinburgh)
      and Michael Bernstein (Austrian Institute of Technology). The\npanel seeks to
      bring multispecies studies into onversation with STS\nfocusing especially on
      the productive unruliness of mutlispecies\ncollaboration. We seek to think about
      in/exclusion of other-than human\nstakeholders and the conceptualization and
      realization of agency in\necological restoration, sustainable agriculture, and
      other future\necologies, as well as environmental science and governance, for
      example\nthe instantiation of the \"do no significant harm\" principle in European\nresearch
      and innovation.\n\nPanel 397 deals with [*Responsible innovation in\nchemistry*](https://www.easst4s2024.net/open-panels/#14500){target=\"_blank\"}.\nIt
      is organized by Laurens Hessels (Rathenau Instituut and CWTS), Lotte\nAsveld
      and Britte Bouchaut (TU Delft), and Esther Versluis (Maastricht\nUniversity).
      Chemical pollution is a main driver for global biodiversity\nloss and the emissions
      of chemical industry contribute substantially to\nclimate change. Regulation
      often falls short of adequately addressing\nall negative impacts of novel chemicals.
      This session calls for papers\naddressing the opportunities for and barriers
      to responsible innovation\nin academic and industrial chemistry. How is knowledge
      produced and what\nstandards determine the validity of knowledge? How do institutional\nframeworks
      impact safety and responsibility allocation in the chemical\nsector? What is
      the responsibility of academic researchers collaborating\nwith industry?\n\nThe
      call for abstract is now\n[open](https://www.easst4s2024.net/callforabstracts/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      will close on 12 February 2024. In case you are interested in\nsubmitting an
      abstract but are unsure whether your paper fits the panel,\ndo reach out to
      the panel organisers. All our panel organisers would be\nhappy to discuss possible
      contributions.\n\n[**This blog was written with contributions from** Jackie

      the evolution of an equitable\\ndigital commons and, in consequence, equitable

      new Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion at CWTS aims to create a more\ndiverse,
      inclusive and engaging science ecosystem. This blogpost\nintroduces our main
      vision and roadmap for the future. We welcome any\nperson or organisation interested
      in these topics to reach out to us!\n\nTo develop our [CWTS knowledge\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      formed [three focal\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\nthe vision
      and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\n\n### Our vision\n\nIn
      today\\''s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\nand inclusive
      science ecosystem that engages with society is of\nparamount importance. As
      we navigate complex global challenges such as\nclimate change, pandemics, and
      artificial intelligence, it becomes\nevident that diverse perspectives, inclusive
      participation and public\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation and communication
      are key to\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal challenges. The Focal\nArea
      Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and promoting diversity\nand inclusivity
      in the science ecosystem and the engagement and\ncommunication between science
      and society.*\n\nIn line with the three pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda
      --\n*understanding*, *intervening* and *practising* -- we developed an\nambitious
      agenda for the study and promotion of diversity, inclusion,\nengagement, communication
      and science-society interactions. Our work\nwill not only contribute to research
      and teaching around these\nquestions, but will also support policy developments
      and interventions,\nand generate insights into how we can implement our findings
      at our own\ncentre.\n\n### Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\n\nWe
      believe diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\nimportant.
      By breaking down barriers to participation in science for\nindividuals from
      a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\nenrich the pool of
      knowledge, ideas, and approaches in research, which,\nin turn, helps to address
      scientific and societal challenges more\neffectively. Who gets to participate
      in science is not always\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding
      and\nwell-considered interventions to improve the inclusion and\nrepresentation
      of all social groups in science, and the science system\nas a whole.\n\n###
      Epistemic Diversity\n\nEpistemic diversity in the science system is of major
      importance. We\nneed to recognise how different topics, research questions,
      knowledge\nsystems, and actors, including\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\"_blank\"}\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\nglobal issues.
      By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\nexpect to foster a more
      inclusive and innovative environment where\ndifferent ways of knowing are valued
      and incorporated.\n\nFor instance, we want to study and address the lack of\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\n\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\n\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\nintegral building blocks for a stronger
      and more relevant research and\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science communication
      and public\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia and society;
      help to\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible to the wider\npublic
      and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry, etc.);\nlimit the impact
      of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\ninformation; and may help to
      increase public trust in science. We will\nstudy how society engages with science,
      in order to improve science\ncommunication and strengthen the role science can
      play in society.\n\n[Citizen\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\n\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\n\n####   {#section dir=\"ltr\"}\n\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion
      is all\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise, projects,\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\n\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\"_blank\"})
      and [institute\nprojects](https://www.cwts.nl/projects/current-projects){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      the work of the [Citizen Science\nLab](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/citizensciencelab){target=\"_blank\"}\nand
      the [UNESCO\nlab](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\"_blank\"}\n(Figure
      1). This mapping formed an excellent means for thinking about\nour future activities.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/board_fullsize.jpg\"\ndata-image=\"1ppykiiy08s7\"
      />\n<figcaption>Figure 1. Mapping of our current projects and activities to\nthe
      three sub-areas (initially labelled as <em>ambitions</em>) - Miro\nboard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n####
      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\"ltr\"}\n\nWe have created a working group for
      each of the three sub-areas to\nbundle expertise and resources. The working
      groups will bring together a\ndiverse range of colleagues, from within and outside
      of CWTS, each\ncontributing with their unique knowledge to tackle the complex\nchallenges
      of the sub-areas.\n\nProjects play a pivotal role in our day-to-day work at
      CWTS. Our Focal\nArea will help coordinate existing projects, and monitor funding\nopportunities
      to set up new projects. Our focused strategy of aligning\nprojects with the
      goals of the Focal Area will be crucial for achieving\nour vision and ambitions.\n\nIn
      addition, engagement and communication activities will be of central\nimportance
      for the Focal Area. We think of [dedicated\nseminars](https://www.cwts.nl/seminars/diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-science){target=\"_blank\"},\nspecial
      sessions at conferences (e.g. a special session on \"[Researching\n(in-) equity,
      diversity and inclusion in science through bibliometric,\nmixed- and multi-method\nstudie](https://www.sti2023.org/timetable/event/session-47/){target=\"_blank\"}s\"\norganised
      at the [STI 2023\nconference](https://www.sti2023.org/program/){target=\"_blank\"}),
      or\nco-creation workshops with citizens and societal stakeholders. In line\nwith
      our ideal of [practising what we\npreach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/introducing-the-cwts-knowledge-agenda-2023-2028){target=\"_blank\"},\nwe
      ourselves will communicate our work and activities to broader\naudiences through
      blog posts and social media, and look forward to open\nand engaging conversations
      with others on these topics.\n\nIf you are interested in partnering with us
      on this exciting journey, we\ninvite you to get in touch with the E&I Focal

      formed [three focal\\nareas](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/the-focal-areas-of-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nat
      the start of this year to organise our activities. Here, we introduce\\nthe
      vision and roadmap of the Focal Area Engagement & Inclusion.\\n\\n### Our vision\\n\\nIn
      today\\\\'s rapidly changing world, fostering a collaborative, diverse\\nand
      inclusive science ecosystem that engages with society is of\\nparamount importance.
      As we navigate complex global challenges such as\\nclimate change, pandemics,
      and artificial intelligence, it becomes\\nevident that diverse perspectives,
      inclusive participation and public\\nengagement in scientific knowledge creation
      and communication are key to\\nunlocking science-based solutions for societal
      challenges. The Focal\\nArea Engagement & Inclusion *envisions studying and
      promoting diversity\\nand inclusivity in the science ecosystem and the engagement
      and\\ncommunication between science and society.*\\n\\nIn line with the three
      pillars of the CWTS knowledge agenda --\\n*understanding*, *intervening* and
      *practising* -- we developed an\\nambitious agenda for the study and promotion
      of diversity, inclusion,\\nengagement, communication and science-society interactions.
      Our work\\nwill not only contribute to research and teaching around these\\nquestions,
      but will also support policy developments and interventions,\\nand generate
      insights into how we can implement our findings at our own\\ncentre.\\n\\n###
      Representation & Inclusiveness {#representation-inclusiveness}\\n\\nWe believe
      diversity and inclusivity in the global science ecosystem is\\nimportant. By
      breaking down barriers to participation in science for\\nindividuals from a
      variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, we\\nenrich the pool of knowledge,
      ideas, and approaches in research, which,\\nin turn, helps to address scientific
      and societal challenges more\\neffectively. Who gets to participate in science
      is not always\\nself-evident and requires more fundamental understanding and\\nwell-considered
      interventions to improve the inclusion and\\nrepresentation of all social groups
      in science, and the science system\\nas a whole.\\n\\n### Epistemic Diversity\\n\\nEpistemic
      diversity in the science system is of major importance. We\\nneed to recognise
      how different topics, research questions, knowledge\\nsystems, and actors, including\\n[other-than-human](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2021.1906040){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nones,
      help to produce a fairer and more nuanced understanding of complex\\nglobal
      issues. By monitoring and promoting epistemic diversity, we\\nexpect to foster
      a more inclusive and innovative environment where\\ndifferent ways of knowing
      are valued and incorporated.\\n\\nFor instance, we want to study and address
      the lack of\\n[coverage](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-coverage-matters-invisibility-of-agricultural-research-from-the-global-south-may-be-an-obstacle-to-development){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nin
      mainstream scientometric databases; a problem that stands in the way\\nof making
      important societal topics visible in science policy.\\nConsequently, we expect
      to develop\\n[*multiversatories*](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-are-diversity-and-inclusion-important-for-global-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\npolicies,
      and recommendations to support funders and science policy with\\nreinforcing
      epistemic diversity.\\n\\n### Engagement & Communication {#engagement-communication}\\n\\nA
      research system that is disconnected from society is essentially\\nineffective.
      Science communication, public engagement with science, and\\nparticipatory approaches
      for collaborative knowledge production are\\nintegral building blocks for a
      stronger and more relevant research and\\ninnovation ecosystem. Effective science
      communication and public\\nengagement help to bridge the gap between academia
      and society; help to\\nmake scientific approaches and knowledge more accessible
      to the wider\\npublic and societal stakeholders (e.g. policy makers, industry,
      etc.);\\nlimit the impact of misinformation and the misuse of scientific\\ninformation;
      and may help to increase public trust in science. We will\\nstudy how society
      engages with science, in order to improve science\\ncommunication and strengthen
      the role science can play in society.\\n\\n[Citizen\\nscience](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/dossiers/academia-in-motion/open-science/citizen-science){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      other participatory approaches can create a stronger sense of\\nsocietal ownership
      and accountability, turning scientific research into\\na collective societal
      endeavour. Societal actors outside academia\\ncontribute to the scientific ecosystem
      in various ways, for instance\\nwith local and traditional knowledge or insights
      from lived experience,\\nor by contributing to evidence-informed policy-making.
      The engagement of\\nsocietal actors can also direct the attention of research
      to issues of\\nsocietal importance, increasing both their societal relevance
      and their\\npractical impacts. Engaging other actors, such as industry,\\npolicy-makers
      or non-governmental organisations, can help with more\\ninformed policy, decision-making
      and innovation. We want to study\\ncitizen-science practices and how they are
      changing scientific outcomes,\\nwith the aim of helping to shape citizen-science
      further.\\n\\n### Accomplishing our ambitions\\n\\n####   {#section dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\n####
      **Coordination of dreams, people, and projects** {#coordination-of-dreams-people-and-projects
      dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nThe real treasure trove of the Focal Area Engagement &
      Inclusion is all\\nthe individual members with their own areas of expertise,
      projects,\\n[dreams](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/dreaming-at-cwts){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      activities. We are a team of more than 30 colleagues from a variety\\nof backgrounds
      and career stages.\\n\\nAs a first step, we mapped our research projects, PhD
      projects, and\\npersonal *dreams* into three sub-areas (which we initially characterised\\nas
      *ambitions*!), as well as into the existing contractual (i.e.,\\n[BV](https://www.cwtsbv.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})

      The roadmap {#the-roadmap dir=\\\"ltr\\\"}\\n\\nWe have created a working group
      for each of the three sub-areas to\\nbundle expertise and resources. The working

      complex\\nchallenges of the sub-areas.\\n\\nProjects play a pivotal role in
      our day-to-day work at CWTS. Our Focal\\nArea will help coordinate existing

      "![](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/_articleThumb/OPEN_OR_OPEN.png)\n\nIn
      this blog post, we examine key historical moments in research\nassessment, access
      to, and affordability of published research, to\nexplain why Open Access and
      its economic models have become an\nincremental solution to a problem requiring
      a revolutionary change.\n\n### Open access: a change in publishing with a limited
      reach\n\nOpen Access is a movement and policy directive dedicated to reforming\nthe
      closed or subscription-based gatekeeping of scientific research. In\nthe subscription-based\u00a0(when
      readers pay) model scientists communicate\nthe results of their research, by
      submitting it to publishers, and in\nmany cases to one of a small number of
      large commercial publishers,\nconsidered to be [an\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\"_blank\"}.\nPublishers
      \\''process\\'' this work, then provide academic institutions\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\''opportunity\\'' to buy back research via\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\n\nDr. Eugene Garfield is
      a renowned figure in certain scientific\ncommunities for having founded the
      [Institute for Scientific Information\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\"_blank\"},\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\nfirst *Science
      Citation\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\nworldwide. Today, this index has been
      expanded commercially to include\nadditional products, which are now part of
      Clarivate\\''s trademarked *Web\nof Science\u2122*.\n\nDr. Garfield\\''s vision
      was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\ndevelop a tool to assist university/college
      libraries with their journal\nselection needs: a one-time legitimate process
      that had already been on\nthe minds of other scientists. [Gross and Gross\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\"_blank\"}
      are\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\"*What files of\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\nstudent for advanced
      work\\... ?*\\\". The answer was to \\\"*compile a\njournal list\"* considered
      to be \\\"*indispensable*\\\", and to base this\nlist on an *\\\"arbitrary standard
      of some kind by which to determine the\ndesirability of purchasing a particular
      journal\\\"* (p. 1713). That\narbitrary standard was to focus on their citedness.
      Years later,\n[Brodman\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\''s\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\"_blank\"})\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\"_blank\"}
      took up\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\nGarfield,

      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\''Open\nAccess\\'',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\npublishing.\n\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\n\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\"_blank\"})\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\nrecognized how difficult it was to process,
      print, collect subscription\nfees and manage society publications without accruing
      financial losses.\nCommercial publishing grew at one time from a legitimate
      and realistic\nneed. Editors required the support, and were for the most part,
      relieved\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific publishing was
      not\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses were\nfounded,
      and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\ngrow at an
      [exponential\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\"_blank\"}\namounting
      to more than\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\"_blank\"},\nthough
      according to [recent\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\"_blank\"},\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\n\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\n\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\n\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\ntowards
      a ''flipped'' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models, but
      we cannot\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\"_blank\"}.
      Some\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\"_blank\"},
      which allows them to\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\nhighly-ranked\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\"_blank\"}.\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\"_blank\"}\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\n[strong age\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\"_blank\"}.
      And,\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal''s\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for ''thoroughness'' and ''helpfulness'' of\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\"_blank\"}\u00a0\n\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \n\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\n\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\n\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\"_blank\"}.\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\nthat we need is fewer
      reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\nsituations where certain researchers
      have little choice but to publish\nin one of the commercially indexed, paywalled
      journals.\n\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that we focus
      *solely*\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it not time to
      exit\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway again, towards\na
      radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\n\n### Socio-Technical
      Innovation\n\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift in perceptions and
      behaviour\npatterns within our global scientific community implies that [innovation\nstarts
      with some sort of ''symbolic\nstrategy''](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\"_blank\"}.\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\nin evaluation
      systems.\n\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He took
      us\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\nBerners-Lee''s
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\nof scientific\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\"_blank\"}!\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\n\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\nif not its editor-in-chief, editorial
      board, and thousands of volunteer\nacademics worldwide who peer review submitted
      manuscripts? Many, if not\nmost scholars believe in preserving the journal,
      and we will likely find\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals perform
      a constituent and\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific fields
      and\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions, we\nmight
      rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\"_blank\"}).\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if ''by any other name'' the\nrose would
      ''smell as sweet!'' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\"_blank\"},\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\nany future
      needs.\n\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\"_blank\"}\nor
      [scholarly digital\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\"_blank\"}).\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\n\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\" and renounce the titled journal\ncalled \"*Quantitative Studies of Quantitativeness*\",
      our international\ncommunity would then think about putting an article up for
      review at the\n\"A Topic-Editorial Team\" or the \"B Topic-Editorial Team\".\n\nWhatever
      solution we choose, it starts with abandoning journal titles\nand rank then
      shifting to an innovative international\nsocio-technological platform, based
      on key journal functions. The result\nwould still be accessible research, still
      peer reviewed, and valued\naccording to what should be valued: editorial teams
      and engaged peer\nreview.\n\nThis solution may be realised in many different
      shapes or forms, and may\nnot necessarily solve all problems. We are not aiming
      to be strictly\nprescriptive here. However, it would put the scholarly record
      keeping\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the hands of commercial\nownership,
      though any kind of solution can include some commercial\nservice providers (e.g.,
      technical expertise, administrative support;\nstyle-setting/XML). It would also
      enable us to give more attention to\nother issues, like [challenges associated
      with peer\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\"_blank\"}.\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\nthrough technological innovation.\n\n  \n\n[[Header

      limited reach\\n\\nOpen Access is a movement and policy directive dedicated
      to reforming\\nthe closed or subscription-based gatekeeping of scientific research.
      In\\nthe subscription-based\_(when readers pay) model scientists communicate\\nthe
      results of their research, by submitting it to publishers, and in\\nmany cases
      to one of a small number of large commercial publishers,\\nconsidered to be
      [an\\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nPublishers
      \\\\'process\\\\' this work, then provide academic institutions\\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\\\'opportunity\\\\' to buy back research via\\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\\n\\nDr. Eugene Garfield
      is a renowned figure in certain scientific\\ncommunities for having founded
      the [Institute for Scientific Information\\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\\nfirst *Science
      Citation\\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\\nworldwide. Today, this index has
      been expanded commercially to include\\nadditional products, which are now part
      of Clarivate\\\\'s trademarked *Web\\nof Science\u2122*.\\n\\nDr. Garfield\\\\'s
      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame

      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost
      academics are keen to support Open Access. Some are even Open\\nAccess ideologists.
      Certain ideologists may be refusing to publish\\ncontent in any journal which
      is currently not freely available and fully\\naccessible. Some might even refuse
      to carry out peer review for\\npublishers that they do not respect *(note: Why
      should I volunteer my\\ntime and efforts to support a greedy industry?)*\\n\\nAn
      approach like this, with all good intentions, has a downside. Though\\nit is
      meant to put pressure on the commercial publishing industry, it is\\nsocially
      and scientifically unaffordable for many members of our broader\\nscientific
      community, especially [at a time when peer review is in\\ncrisis](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/13/peer-review-crisis-creates-problems-journals-and-scholars){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nScholars
      are responsible for peer review, yet find it difficult amidst\\nthis tension
      between open access and paywalled content. The last thing\\nthat we need is
      fewer reviewers to call upon, or at least one less in\\nsituations where certain
      researchers have little choice but to publish\\nin one of the commercially indexed,
      paywalled journals.\\n\\nPerhaps support for Open Access no longer demands that
      we focus *solely*\\non current ideologies attributed to this mandate. Is it
      not time to exit\\nthe well-lit OA-room and trip down that long dark hallway
      again, towards\\na radically new, and disruptive socio-technical innovation?\\n\\n###
      Socio-Technical Innovation\\n\\nThe creation of a systemic change, or shift
      in perceptions and behaviour\\npatterns within our global scientific community
      implies that [innovation\\nstarts with some sort of 'symbolic\\nstrategy'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-change-the-world-9780195334760?cc=dk&lang=en&){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nA
      strategy, which encourages scholars and institutions worldwide, to\\nrelinquish
      the symbolic nature of journal rank and prestige, especially\\nin evaluation
      systems.\\n\\nDr. Garfield was a socio-technical innovator for his time. He
      took us\\nfrom the print age into the electronic age. We have also been introduced\\nto
      the semantic Web, and now we are at the development stages of Web\\n5.0 - the
      open, linked, and intelligent Web. Let us not forget that [Tim\\nBerners-Lee's
      idea behind the Web in the first place was to keep track\\nof scientific\\ninformation](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/birth-web){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}!\\nIn
      addition to a symbolic shift within the scientific/scholarly\\ncommunication
      system we can move towards a material or tangible shift.\\n\\nImagine, therefore;
      a reputation economy in science/scholarship, which\\nis not attached to journal
      rank and title. What is a scientific journal,\\nif not its editor-in-chief,
      editorial board, and thousands of volunteer\\nacademics worldwide who peer review
      submitted manuscripts? Many, if not\\nmost scholars believe in preserving the
      journal, and we will likely find\\nit difficult to forget about them. Journals
      perform a constituent and\\norganising role; a tangible outlet for scientific
      fields and\\ndisciplines. But, if we open ourselves up to more radical solutions,
      we\\nmight rather focus on preserving the registering, curating, evaluating,\\ndisseminating,
      and archiving function of journals, whilst keeping in\\nmind that[*their real
      value* lies in the communities that they\\ncreate.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/29/the-value-of-a-journal-is-the-community-it-creates-not-the-papers-it-publishes/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nEditors
      and editorial teams, for example, may choose to forgo journal\\n*titles* altogether
      and exit a commercial publisher (Note: [Exits do\\nhappen, as in the case of
      an editor and editorial board leaving a\\ncommercial publisher to form a new
      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      limited reach\\n\\nOpen Access is a movement and policy directive dedicated
      to reforming\\nthe closed or subscription-based gatekeeping of scientific research.
      In\\nthe subscription-based\_(when readers pay) model scientists communicate\\nthe
      results of their research, by submitting it to publishers, and in\\nmany cases
      to one of a small number of large commercial publishers,\\nconsidered to be
      [an\\noligopoly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nPublishers
      \\\\'process\\\\' this work, then provide academic institutions\\n(i.e., libraries)
      with an \\\\'opportunity\\\\' to buy back research via\\njournal subscriptions.
      This is neither sound economically, nor is it\\nconducive to the growth of scientific
      knowledge. Open Access has\\ntherefore become a critically assessed and well-researched
      subject,\\nfocused on alternative approaches to publishing - i.e., green, gold,
      and\\nhybrid journal publishing, and Article Processing Fees (APCs) paid by\\ninstitutions
      or scholars themselves (author pays model). As a global\\nproject there is ample
      evidence that Open Access has a [limited\\nreach](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/97555){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\n###
      Journal citation indexing and ranking (Assessment)\\n\\nDr. Eugene Garfield
      is a renowned figure in certain scientific\\ncommunities for having founded
      the [Institute for Scientific Information\\n(ISI)](https://clarivate.com/the-institute-for-scientific-information/history-of-isi/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nand
      for his [innovation in automated journal citation indexing - the\\nfirst *Science
      Citation\\nIndex*](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/science1955.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nDr.
      Garfield lived a long and successful life (until the age of 91!);\\nlong enough
      to see his *Science Citation Index* grow to be one of the\\nmost useful reference
      tools for scholars and scientometricians\\nworldwide. Today, this index has
      been expanded commercially to include\\nadditional products, which are now part
      of Clarivate\\\\'s trademarked *Web\\nof Science\u2122*.\\n\\nDr. Garfield\\\\'s
      vision was not only to trace the history of ideas, but\\ndevelop a tool to assist
      university/college libraries with their journal\\nselection needs: a one-time
      legitimate process that had already been on\\nthe minds of other scientists.
      [Gross and Gross\\n(1927)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      are\\ncredited by Garfield for being the first to ask: \\\\\\\"*What files of\\nscientific
      periodicals are needed in a college library to prepare the\\nstudent for advanced
      work\\\\... ?*\\\\\\\". The answer was to \\\\\\\"*compile a\\njournal list\\\"*
      considered to be \\\\\\\"*indispensable*\\\\\\\", and to base this\\nlist on
      an *\\\\\\\"arbitrary standard of some kind by which to determine the\\ndesirability
      of purchasing a particular journal\\\\\\\"* (p. 1713). That\\narbitrary standard
      was to focus on their citedness. Years later,\\n[Brodman\\n(1944)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC194405/pdf/mlab00266-0074.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nbecame
      a critic of [Gross and Gross\\\\'s\\n(1922](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1651803){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nquantitative
      method, then shortly after, [Fussler\\n(1949)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4303733){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}
      took up\\nthe task again of listing leading journals. However, it was Dr.\\nGarfield,
      along with his innovation in electronic indexing, who\\nintroduced the [Journal
      Impact Factor\\n(JIF](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/V1p527y1962-73.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\n\\nFor
      a long time, *the Science Citation Index* had a positive impact.\\nAlthough
      Garfield both witnessed and warned against the misuse of the\\nJIF when evaluating
      individuals, he is 'blissfully' unaware of the scale\\nof problems resulting
      from the [use of the Journal Impact\\nFactor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-007-2036-x){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nNow,
      we are looking down a long dark hallway leading to what some might\\ncall\\n\\\\'[grimpact](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/05/28/grimpact-time-to-acknowledge-the-dark-side-of-the-impact-agenda/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\\\'.\\nIf
      we exit this dark hallway, we veer into a lit room called \\\\'Open\\nAccess\\\\',
      but, how does this relate to research assessment, and when did\\nwe get here?
      To answer this, we can go further back in history, when\\nscience first handed
      itself over to the profitable business of scholarly\\npublishing.\\n\\n### The
      growth of commercial publishing and journals (Access)\\n\\nWhen scientific letters,
      reports, and later periodicals first appeared\\n(i.e., the [*Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal\\nSociety*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"})\\nthere
      were good reasons to outsource publishing to fledgling businesses.\\nEarly editors,
      like Henry Oldenburg (i.e., founding editor of the\\n*Philosophical Transactions*),
      were keen to generate income, but soon\\nrecognized how difficult it was to
      process, print, collect subscription\\nfees and manage society publications
      without accruing financial losses.\\nCommercial publishing grew at one time
      from a legitimate and realistic\\nneed. Editors required the support, and were
      for the most part, relieved\\nto hand over the work. In the beginning scientific
      publishing was not\\nprofitable, but gradually it became more so. New businesses
      were\\nfounded, and for the past three and half centuries we have seen journals\\ngrow
      at an [exponential\\nrate,](https://doi.org/10.1533/9781780634647.159){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\namounting
      to more than\\n[30,000](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthough
      according to [recent\\nestimates](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00228/114119/Recalibrating-the-Scope-of-Scholarly-Publishing-A){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nthis
      number falls woefully short.\\n\\n### Digital publishing and pay models (Affordability)\\n\\nWe
      have now moved further and further away from this print-based\\nhistory, having
      stepped firmly into the digital age. Digital publishing\\nis less costly, and
      affords a significantly broader reach. However, the\\ncommercial subscription
      model paired with the ISI-Citation Index and\\nelite selection of journals (based
      on the JIF) contributes not only to\\nthe evaluation problem, but the access
      problem as well.\\n\\nWith the legacy of print maintained, Open Access is transitioning\\ntowards
      a 'flipped' publishing economy solution, with an increasing\\nmarket concentration
      of academic publishers. This development is pushed\\nby science policy and transformative
      agreements, but also by the\\nacquisitions of Open Access publishers. Consumption-side
      business models\\nare slowly being replaced by supply-side-business models,
      but we cannot\\nassume that [there will always be enough money in the academic\\nsystem](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1219){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      Some\\nscholars can benefit from [Plan\\nS](https://www.coalition-s.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},
      which allows them to\\nrely on public research funding to make research results
      immediately\\naccessible, but such affordability is not available to all. Research\\nshows
      that when scholars intend to submit a new manuscript for\\npublication, [consideration
      is still given to the prestige attached to a\\nhighly-ranked\\njournal](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nEmpirical
      studies in the field of biomedicine have also shown how\\n[knowledge production
      is consolidated around the\\nJIF.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9274-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nMany
      journals are simply privileged with a high rank, because of a\\n[strong age\\nbias](https://doi.org/10.5465/amle.2009.37012185){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      And,\\nin the age of AI, new empirical research has found that a [journal's\\nimpact
      factor is a bad predictor for 'thoroughness' and 'helpfulness' of\\nreviews.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02787-5){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_\\n\\nThus,
      it seems more important than ever to ask ourselves how we can\\ncontinue with
      Open Access, when the technology behind indexing, and the\\njournal reputation
      economy has added to continued problems.  \\n\\n### Open Access Ideology  {#open-access-ideology}\\n\\nMost

      Open Access\\njournal](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/1/15579/Opening-science-The-rebirth-of-a-scholarly-journal?searchresult=1){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nIn
      Shakespearian terms, what is in a name if 'by any other name' the\\nrose would
      'smell as sweet!' (i.e., journal name is different, but the\\neditorial community
      is the same, and scholars continue to respect that\\neditorial community)? In
      a similar vein, editorial boards might be\\nencouraged to leave a commercial
      publisher, and move to an Open Access\\nInternational Scholarship Space: A space
      [focused on managing and\\nmaintaining digitally transformed scholarly\\nrecords](https://zenodo.org/record/6948200#.ZD_Pyy9Byjh){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},\\nwhich
      fulfils the traditional functions of a journal, ready to adapt to\\nany future
      needs.\\n\\nImagine a solution where an editor and editorial team are assigned
      to a\\ntopic management center of their own creation (i.e., [a kind of digital\\nlibrary](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications11010007){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nor
      [scholarly digital\\ninfrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/5564003){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}).\\nAt
      each online center, there could be a description of the topic area,\\nincluding
      the specialty research areas of the editorial team. So, for\\nexample, if we
      renounce a commercially published journal called the\\n\\\"*Journal of the Information
      Age*\\\" and renounce the titled journal\\ncalled \\\"*Quantitative Studies
      of Quantitativeness*\\\", our international\\ncommunity would then think about
      putting an article up for review at the\\n\\\"A Topic-Editorial Team\\\" or
      the \\\"B Topic-Editorial Team\\\".\\n\\nWhatever solution we choose, it starts
      with abandoning journal titles\\nand rank then shifting to an innovative international\\nsocio-technological
      platform, based on key journal functions. The result\\nwould still be accessible
      research, still peer reviewed, and valued\\naccording to what should be valued:
      editorial teams and engaged peer\\nreview.\\n\\nThis solution may be realised
      in many different shapes or forms, and may\\nnot necessarily solve all problems.
      We are not aiming to be strictly\\nprescriptive here. However, it would put
      the scholarly record keeping\\nfirmly back into our own hands, and not in the
      hands of commercial\\nownership, though any kind of solution can include some
      commercial\\nservice providers (e.g., technical expertise, administrative support;\\nstyle-setting/XML).
      It would also enable us to give more attention to\\nother issues, like [challenges
      associated with peer\\nreview](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00403-8){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nTaking
      such steps would be difficult, but we believe that the\\ninternational science
      community is ready, and that there is more to gain\\nthrough technological innovation.\\n\\n

      this blog post, we\\''ll introduce you to the CWTS ECR/PhD Council,\nshedding
      light on its significance, objectives, and how it can serve as\na crucial resource
      for early career researchers and PhDs at CWTS.\n\nCWTS is an interdisciplinary
      institute at Leiden University with a\ndiverse multinational academic culture.
      PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers, and visiting scholars from around
      the world gather at CWTS\nto pursue their research journeys. The journey can
      be an inspiring yet\nchallenging experience. It might be filled with research,
      innovation,\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey that feels isolating\nat
      times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers need to\nspend extended
      periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\ndetachment from the broader
      social and academic community. Loneliness\ncan be particularly challenging for
      our PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers and visiting researchers who have
      transitioned to a new,\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and to create
      a dynamic and\nsupportive community, in September, we have started an Early
      Career\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian Xie as the\nChair
      and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\n\n### What does it mean
      to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\n\nThere is more to being
      a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\nassumes full involvement in
      the research process, from generating ideas\nto implementing them practically.
      The research process includes not only\nconducting research but also actively
      participating in academic events\nsuch as seminars, conferences, symposia, and
      round tables. Here, PhD\ncandidates can exchange experiences with peers, discuss
      their ideas, and\nbecome familiar with new methods and approaches in their field
      of\nknowledge.\n\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails constant self-development
      and\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously update one\\''s knowledge,\nmonitor
      new trends and discoveries in their field. Ultimately, all of\nthis contributes
      to the development of the PhD candidates'' professional\nskills, their readiness
      for independent research activities, and\nsuccessful careers.\n\nTo some extent,
      the same holds true for early career researchers -- not\nonly the PhD candidates.
      Early career researchers are people taking\ntheir first steps in a academic
      career. They have a fresh and critical\nview of the world, full of energy and
      desire to contribute to the\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues
      are doing\nresearch without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we
      need to\ninclude them as well, since some of their struggles are the same.\n\nTo
      provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we established\nthe ECR/PhD
      Council.\n\n### What is the ECR/PhD Council?\n\nThe ECR/PhD Council is a small,
      dedicated body (currently consisting of\ntwo members) within CWTS that brings
      together PhDs and early career\nresearchers. The Council is committed to the
      promotion of internal\ncommunication, coordination of supportive and networking
      activities, and\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community. At the same
      time, the\nCouncil is the formal connection between the ECRs and PhDs and the
      CWTS\nPhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.\n\n### What are we planning
      to do?\n\n- Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD can often feel\n  like
      a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\n  community where
      individuals can connect, share experiences, and\n  provide emotional support
      to one another. The Council members also\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic
      related meetings and informal\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the
      well-being and social\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits.
      For instance,\n  introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\n  pub-quizzes.\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\n  English to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD
      candidates may\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results, papers,\n  posters).
      We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\n  farewell meetings
      for early career researchers, providing them with\n  the opportunity to present
      the research they have conducted during\n  their time at CWTS. Of course, this
      event is not mandatory but highly\n  encouraged.\n- Buddy system: New CWTS PhD
      candidates are now offered the opportunity\n  to be paired with a senior CWTS
      PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\n  candidate). External PhD candidates
      will also benefit from this\n  system.\n- Providing insights to the CWTS Management
      Board.\n\n### What has happened so far?\n\nOur experience of joining the ECR/PhD
      Council has been great so far!\nIt''s not just about attending meetings and
      organizing events. It''s all\nabout being part of a supportive and dynamic academic
      community. Here''s\nwhat the experience has been like:\n\n- Community Building:
      We''ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow\n  PhD students and early
      career researcher from various fields, which\n  has broadened our perspective.\n-
      Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered by\n  the
      council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our\n  knowledge
      base.\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice our needs\n  and
      concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It''s\n  empowering
      to know that our interests are being represented.\n- Collaboration and Leadership:
      We''ve already been encouraged to take on\n  leadership roles within the council,
      which we hope will allow us to\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\n\nOn
      October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\nat which
      the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc had a chance to\nintroduce their research.
      The chairman of the Council also introduced\nall issues relevant to do a PhD
      at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses,
      etc.). Even though the\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"\nalt=\"Welcoming
      event photo\" />\n<figcaption>First welcoming event organised by the ECR/PhD\nCouncil.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter
      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\nwas not only a fascinating
      cultural experience but also an excellent way\nto strengthen relationships.  \n\nIf
      you would like to share your experience on how PhD activities are\norganized
      in your institution or if you have any questions, you can\nreach us via ecrphd@cwts.leidenuniv.nl!\n\n  \n\n[Header

      this blog post, we\\''ll introduce you to the CWTS ECR/PhD Council,\nshedding
      light on its significance, objectives, and how it can serve as\na crucial resource
      for early career researchers and PhDs at CWTS.\n\nCWTS is an interdisciplinary
      institute at Leiden University with a\ndiverse multinational academic culture.
      PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers, and visiting scholars from around
      the world gather at CWTS\nto pursue their research journeys. The journey can
      be an inspiring yet\nchallenging experience. It might be filled with research,
      innovation,\nand personal growth, but it can also be a journey that feels isolating\nat
      times due to the solitary nature of research. Researchers need to\nspend extended
      periods working alone, which can lead to a sense of\ndetachment from the broader
      social and academic community. Loneliness\ncan be particularly challenging for
      our PhD candidates, early career\nresearchers and visiting researchers who have
      transitioned to a new,\nunfamiliar environment. To counter this and to create
      a dynamic and\nsupportive community, in September, we have started an Early
      Career\nResearcher (ECR) /PhD council with the two of us, Qianqian Xie as the\nChair
      and Dmitry Kochetkov as a Council member, in the lead.\n\n### What does it mean
      to be a PhD candidate or early career researcher?\n\nThere is more to being
      a PhD candidate than just obtaining a degree. It\nassumes full involvement in
      the research process, from generating ideas\nto implementing them practically.
      The research process includes not only\nconducting research but also actively
      participating in academic events\nsuch as seminars, conferences, symposia, and
      round tables. Here, PhD\ncandidates can exchange experiences with peers, discuss
      their ideas, and\nbecome familiar with new methods and approaches in their field
      of\nknowledge.\n\nBeing a PhD candidate also entails constant self-development
      and\nself-education. It is necessary to continuously update one\\''s knowledge,\nmonitor
      new trends and discoveries in their field. Ultimately, all of\nthis contributes
      to the development of the PhD candidates'' professional\nskills, their readiness
      for independent research activities, and\nsuccessful careers.\n\nTo some extent,
      the same holds true for early career researchers -- not\nonly the PhD candidates.
      Early career researchers are people taking\ntheir first steps in a academic
      career. They have a fresh and critical\nview of the world, full of energy and
      desire to contribute to the\ndevelopment of science. At CWTS, quite a few colleagues
      are doing\nresearch without following a PhD trajectory. We realized that we
      need to\ninclude them as well, since some of their struggles are the same.\n\nTo
      provide support on the PhD and early career journey, we established\nthe ECR/PhD
      Council.\n\n### What is the ECR/PhD Council?\n\nThe ECR/PhD Council is a small,
      dedicated body (currently consisting of\ntwo members) within CWTS that brings
      together PhDs and early career\nresearchers. The Council is committed to the
      promotion of internal\ncommunication, coordination of supportive and networking
      activities, and\nsocial cohesion within the ECR/ PhD community. At the same
      time, the\nCouncil is the formal connection between the ECRs and PhDs and the
      CWTS\nPhD coordinator and the CWTS management board.\n\n### What are we planning
      to do?\n\n- Building a Supportive Community: Pursuing an ECR/PhD can often feel\n  like
      a solitary endeavor. The ECR/PhD Council offers a supportive\n  community where
      individuals can connect, share experiences, and\n  provide emotional support
      to one another. The Council members also\n  take the lead in organizing non-academic
      related meetings and informal\n  ECR/PhD moments, to provide support for the
      well-being and social\n  needs of individuals beyond their academic pursuits.
      For instance,\n  introducing properly new CWTS ECRs/PhD candidates and discussing\n  challenges
      met during the PhD trajectory. Every two months we will\n  have informal ECR/PhD
      moments (on-site), including drinks and\n  pub-quizzes.\n- Academic Networking
      Opportunities: The Council provides a platform for\n  networking with peers,
      mentors and potential collaborators, opening\n  doors to new research opportunities.
      The Council holds monthly ECR/PhD\n  internal seminars. These meetings will
      be held in hybrid format and in\n  English to be as inclusive as possible. ECRs/PhD
      candidates may\n  present and discuss academic work (proposals, results, papers,\n  posters).
      We are also delighted to announce that the Council hosts\n  farewell meetings
      for early career researchers, providing them with\n  the opportunity to present
      the research they have conducted during\n  their time at CWTS. Of course, this
      event is not mandatory but highly\n  encouraged.\n- Buddy system: New CWTS PhD
      candidates are now offered the opportunity\n  to be paired with a senior CWTS
      PhD candidate (a 2nd or 3rd year PhD\n  candidate). External PhD candidates
      will also benefit from this\n  system.\n- Providing insights to the CWTS Management
      Board.\n\n### What has happened so far?\n\nOur experience of joining the ECR/PhD
      Council has been great so far!\nIt''s not just about attending meetings and
      organizing events. It''s all\nabout being part of a supportive and dynamic academic
      community. Here''s\nwhat the experience has been like:\n\n- Community Building:
      We''ve had the opportunity to connect with fellow\n  PhD students and early
      career researcher from various fields, which\n  has broadened our perspective.\n-
      Professional Development: Workshops, seminars and resources offered by\n  the
      council are sharpening our professional skills and broaden our\n  knowledge
      base.\n- Voice and Advocacy: The council gives us a platform to voice our needs\n  and
      concerns as PhD candidates and early career researchers. It''s\n  empowering
      to know that our interests are being represented.\n- Collaboration and Leadership:
      We''ve already been encouraged to take on\n  leadership roles within the council,
      which we hope will allow us to\n  develop leadership and teamwork skills.\n\nOn
      October 13, 2023, ECR/PhD Council held its first welcoming meeting,\nat which
      the new PhD candidate and a new postdoc had a chance to\nintroduce their research.
      The chairman of the Council also introduced\nall issues relevant to do a PhD
      at CWTS (i.e. facilities and services\noffered to PhDs, PhD trainings and courses,
      etc.). Even though the\nmeeting took place on Friday, 13 nothing terrible happened.
      On the\ncontrary, the meeting was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  \n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/uploads/Welcoming-event-photo.png\"\nalt=\"Welcoming
      event photo\" />\n<figcaption>First welcoming event organised by the ECR/PhD\nCouncil.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter
      the meeting, the council prepared food for all participants, and\none of our
      colleagues even taught others how to roll spring rolls. It\nwas not only a fascinating
      cultural experience but also an excellent way\nto strengthen relationships.  \n\nIf
      you would like to share your experience on how PhD activities are\norganized
      in your institution or if you have any questions, you can\nreach us via ecrphd@cwts.leidenuniv.nl!\n\n  \n\n[Header

      science need heroes or does it need to reform? Idolizing heroes can\nworsen
      bias, inequality, and competition in science. Yet, it does\nrequire good leadership
      to ignite structural change. This commentary for\na Rijksmuseum Boerhaave symposium
      on prize cultures aims to address this\nparadox.\n\nOn the occasion of the 2023
      Nobel Prize announcements, [the Rijksmuseum\nBoerhaave symposium\n\"](https://rijksmuseumboerhaave.nl/symposium-does-science-need-heroes/){target=\"_blank\"}*[Does\nscience
      need\nheroes?\"](https://rijksmuseumboerhaave.nl/symposium-does-science-need-heroes/){target=\"_blank\"}*\nattempted
      to explore the evolution of prize cultures over time and\nexamine the current
      and potential roles of prizes in contemporary\nscientific practices. I would
      like to thank Ad Maas, Curator of Modern\nNatural Sciences of Rijksmuseum Boerhaave
      and professor in Museological\nAspects of the Natural Sciences at the Centre
      for the Arts in Society of\nLeiden University, for inviting me to give a comment
      on the second day\nof the symposium. This blog post is an adaptation of the
      talk I gave\nthere.\n\n*Does science need heroes?* Spoken like a proper academic,
      my answer to\nthis question would be: yes and no.\n\nLet me start with the latter.\n\nNo,
      the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What it does\nneed is
      structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\nvarious forms
      of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\nrigor, excessive competition,
      commercialization, and vanity publishing.\nIt is unhealthy for researchers to
      want to be a hero in the current\nsystem.\n\nBut also: yes! Science is in dire
      need of heroes! Because the science\nsystem needs to reform, we need different
      types of people who can lead\nthe way and set an example with good leadership.
      This is what I want to\naddress in this commentary.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img

      Commons</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \nBut first, and inspired by Museum
      Boerhaave\\''s wonderful collection, I\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\n\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}.\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\n\\''eminence\\'', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\nbetween Cattell\\''s work on \\''eminence\\''
      as the primary \\''virtue\\'' of\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\n\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\''eminence\\'' or greatness,\nobserved a decrease in the number
      of \\''great men\\'' compared to earlier\nperiods, which they found concerning.
      They feared the biological\ndegeneration of the population, and this fear was
      exacerbated by a more\ngeneral concern about the decline of the British Empire.
      This fear was\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization, democratization,\nand
      a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\''great men\\'' was\nalso
      reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist in a\ntime when
      scientific work increasingly became a \\''profession\\'' among\nother professions.
      The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\ntools to classify \\''eminence\\''
      in a new way. His idea was that\nprofessors could be placed on a single ranked
      list based on peer review.\nHe asked a large number of scientists to create
      a list, ranking\nscientists from the most to the least prominent, based on a
      selection of\nnames provided in advance. High \\\"output\\\" was insufficient
      as an\nindicator of \\''eminence\\''; it was primarily about reputation among\npeers.
      What exactly this reputation was based on remained ambiguous.\nCattell kept
      various background and biographical information about the\nmen on the lists,
      including data on birthplace, residence, age, and\nespecially the university
      where researchers had received their\neducation. But his lists also quickly
      started to serve other purposes:\nhe mapped how \\''scientific eminence\\''
      was distributed across cities and\nuniversities. And I quote from a piece in
      1903: \\\"We can tell whether\nthe average scientific standard in one part of
      the country or at a\ncertain university is higher or lower than elsewhere; we
      can also\nquantitatively map the scientific strength of a university or\ndepartment.\\\"
      So, initially, Cattell\\''s lists were not compiled with the\npurpose of comparing
      institutions, but the information these instruments\nprovided was indeed used
      for these comparisons.\n\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/tblCattell.png\"\ndata-image=\"36480\"
      />\n<figcaption>Table from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1627220\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Cattell,
      1898</a>: Doctorates in Philosophy from\nAmerican universities in a single year</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\nCattell\\''s
      study of scientific men and his subsequent ranking of\nuniversities was deeply
      rooted in a larger debate about the role of the\nscientist. The ideal image
      of a researcher was evolving significantly at\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning
      of the 20th century, as I think is\nhappening again today. But back then, older
      ideas about the\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\n\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\ninstruments have in the past decades started to
      shape our perception of\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback loop
      between policy on\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on the other.
      An\nexcellent researcher''s standing is now primarily determined by their\nresearch
      production. This is partly still science as a profession that\nCattell and others
      instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\nkey performance indicators
      (like a lot of other professions in\nneoliberal democratic societies). The primary
      tactical and strategic\naims have become competing for (ever decreasing amounts
      of) research\nincome, and publishing in prestigious journals, and aiming for
      a Nobel\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards have become important parts\nof
      academic CVs. And because of gender and other diversity gaps, this\nmakes it
      harder for women and other minority groups to make a career in\nscience. University
      rankings use prizes and awards as input, and this\ntrickles down in university
      policies. Universities over the past decades\nhave started to think in terms
      of globalised economic markets for\nexcellent researchers.\n\nThe motivation
      behind policies for excellence perhaps at one point made\nsense, and Dutch science
      is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\nand this is not often acknowledged,
      there is a big structural issue with\nthe way we measure excellence. If we are
      truly honest: current notions\nof excellence and metrics-driven assessment criteria
      are threatening to\nshape the content of the work and the diversity of the subject
      matter.\nWe are observing that research is designed and adjusted in a way that\nensures
      a good score. We see that people are choosing research questions\nnot just based
      on interest or importance, but also to improve their\nchances of getting a job.
      This [''thinking with\nindicators''](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\"_blank\"}\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\nare not
      being addressed and even become ''unthinkable''.\n\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\nfor what you could call ''social''
      elements. Think of decreasing\ncollegiality, less commitment to the community,
      or bad leadership. And\nif we\\''re mostly noticing and applauding the \\''big
      names,\\'' those\nveteran academics with a significant reputation, we are hurting
      the\nopportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who play\ncrucial
      roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is so\nhigh that
      ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday\nbecause otherwise
      their work will be ''scooped''. Competitiveness can\ncreate feelings of constant
      failure among early career researchers, as\nthey may never feel they meet the
      required standards. And even those who\nare at the top, and we have interviewed
      many, often feel they must\ncontinue to work ever harder to keep out-competing
      others. Group leaders\nand heads of department warn each other about the health
      risks that they\nrun by chronically working very hard, year after year. This
      is an actual\nquote from an actual interview:  \n\nThe example these senior
      researchers are setting with that behaviour to\ntheir younger colleagues is
      that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\nweek, and that if people can''t keep
      up, they are not fit for the\nChampions League. These senior researchers have
      really internalised that\nthis is what it takes to play the game, and that if
      you can''t stand the\nheat, you should get out of the kitchen. But let''s face
      it, that kitchen\nis on fire.\n\nFor one, we have globally had several severe
      integrity and\nreproducibility crises. We have seen the shadow side of competition,\nwhere
      researchers focus too much on finding new things and trying to do\nthat quickly,
      even if that means that they might not be doing\nhigh-quality research. Of course,
      we all want to tell our students to\ndream big and ideally, we also provide
      them with the protected space to\ndevelop their own research and strive for
      the highest quality. However,\nif in the meantime we also encourage them to
      focus on chasing after\ngroundbreaking results and judge success mainly by how
      many times our\nwork gets cited by others, we create a culture where short-termism
      and\nrisk aversion thrive. This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\nsecure
      funding in competitive four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\nvery hard
      for researchers to do long-term, risky projects, or work in\nfields that have
      a big impact on society but don\\''t get cited as much,\nlike applied sciences
      or social sciences. As a result, research agendas\ndon\\''t always focus on
      what society really needs. Also, all this\ncompetition can make scientists less
      likely to collaborate, which is\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\n\nTo
      make science better, we need to change our priorities, and support a\nwider
      range of research. We very urgently need more diverse perspectives\nand inclusive
      participation in science. [We need to collaborate and open\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\"_blank\"}\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\nreally need to rethink the
      criteria for excellent research. These\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
      because research evaluation has the\npower to affect the culture of research;
      individual career trajectories\nand researchers'' well-being; the quality of

      my answer to\\nthis question would be: yes and no.\\n\\nLet me start with the
      latter.\\n\\nNo, the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What
      it does\\nneed is structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\\nvarious
      forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\\nrigor, excessive
      competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.\\nIt is unhealthy for
      researchers to want to be a hero in the current\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut also: yes!
      Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science\\nsystem needs to reform,
      we need different types of people who can lead\\nthe way and set an example
      with good leadership. This is what I want to\\naddress in this commentary.\\n\\n<figure

      Commons</a></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nBut first, and inspired by Museum
      Boerhaave\\\\'s wonderful collection, I\\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\\n\\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\\n\\\\'eminence\\\\', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\\nbetween Cattell\\\\'s work on \\\\'eminence\\\\'
      as the primary \\\\'virtue\\\\' of\\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\\n\\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\\\'eminence\\\\' or greatness,\\nobserved a decrease in the
      number of \\\\'great men\\\\' compared to earlier\\nperiods, which they found
      concerning. They feared the biological\\ndegeneration of the population, and
      this fear was exacerbated by a more\\ngeneral concern about the decline of the
      British Empire. This fear was\\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization,
      democratization,\\nand a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\\\'great
      men\\\\' was\\nalso reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist
      in a\\ntime when scientific work increasingly became a \\\\'profession\\\\'
      among\\nother professions. The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\\ntools
      to classify \\\\'eminence\\\\' in a new way. His idea was that\\nprofessors
      could be placed on a single ranked list based on peer review.\\nHe asked a large
      number of scientists to create a list, ranking\\nscientists from the most to
      the least prominent, based on a selection of\\nnames provided in advance. High
      \\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\" was insufficient as an\\nindicator of \\\\'eminence\\\\';
      it was primarily about reputation among\\npeers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous.\\nCattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the\\nmen on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and\\nespecially the university where researchers had received their\\neducation.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes:\\nhe mapped how
      \\\\'scientific eminence\\\\' was distributed across cities and\\nuniversities.
      And I quote from a piece in 1903: \\\\\\\"We can tell whether\\nthe average
      scientific standard in one part of the country or at a\\ncertain university
      is higher or lower than elsewhere; we can also\\nquantitatively map the scientific
      strength of a university or\\ndepartment.\\\\\\\" So, initially, Cattell\\\\'s
      lists were not compiled with the\\npurpose of comparing institutions, but the
      information these instruments\\nprovided was indeed used for these comparisons.\\n\\n<figure

      />\\n<figcaption>Table from <a href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1627220\\\"\\ntarget=\\\"_blank\\\">Cattell,
      1898</a>: Doctorates in Philosophy from\\nAmerican universities in a single
      year</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nCattell\\\\'s study of scientific
      men and his subsequent ranking of\\nuniversities was deeply rooted in a larger
      debate about the role of the\\nscientist. The ideal image of a researcher was
      evolving significantly at\\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
      century, as I think is\\nhappening again today. But back then, older ideas about
      the\\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\\n\\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\\ninstruments have in the past decades started
      to shape our perception of\\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback
      loop between policy on\\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on
      the other. An\\nexcellent researcher's standing is now primarily determined
      by their\\nresearch production. This is partly still science as a profession
      that\\nCattell and others instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\\nkey
      performance indicators (like a lot of other professions in\\nneoliberal democratic
      societies). The primary tactical and strategic\\naims have become competing
      for (ever decreasing amounts of) research\\nincome, and publishing in prestigious
      journals, and aiming for a Nobel\\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards
      have become important parts\\nof academic CVs. And because of gender and other
      diversity gaps, this\\nmakes it harder for women and other minority groups to
      make a career in\\nscience. University rankings use prizes and awards as input,
      and this\\ntrickles down in university policies. Universities over the past
      decades\\nhave started to think in terms of globalised economic markets for\\nexcellent
      researchers.\\n\\nThe motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one
      point made\\nsense, and Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\\nand
      this is not often acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with\\nthe way
      we measure excellence. If we are truly honest: current notions\\nof excellence
      and metrics-driven assessment criteria are threatening to\\nshape the content
      of the work and the diversity of the subject matter.\\nWe are observing that
      research is designed and adjusted in a way that\\nensures a good score. We see
      that people are choosing research questions\\nnot just based on interest or
      importance, but also to improve their\\nchances of getting a job. This ['thinking
      with\\nindicators'](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\\nare not
      being addressed and even become 'unthinkable'.\\n\\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\\nfor what you could call 'social'
      elements. Think of decreasing\\ncollegiality, less commitment to the community,
      or bad leadership. And\\nif we\\\\'re mostly noticing and applauding the \\\\'big
      names,\\\\' those\\nveteran academics with a significant reputation, we are
      hurting the\\nopportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who
      play\\ncrucial roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is
      so\\nhigh that ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday\\nbecause
      otherwise their work will be 'scooped'. Competitiveness can\\ncreate feelings
      of constant failure among early career researchers, as\\nthey may never feel
      they meet the required standards. And even those who\\nare at the top, and we
      have interviewed many, often feel they must\\ncontinue to work ever harder to
      keep out-competing others. Group leaders\\nand heads of department warn each
      other about the health risks that they\\nrun by chronically working very hard,
      year after year. This is an actual\\nquote from an actual interview:  \\n\\nThe
      example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour to\\ntheir
      younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\\nweek, and that
      if people can't keep up, they are not fit for the\\nChampions League. These
      senior researchers have really internalised that\\nthis is what it takes to
      play the game, and that if you can't stand the\\nheat, you should get out of
      the kitchen. But let's face it, that kitchen\\nis on fire.\\n\\nFor one, we
      have globally had several severe integrity and\\nreproducibility crises. We
      have seen the shadow side of competition,\\nwhere researchers focus too much
      on finding new things and trying to do\\nthat quickly, even if that means that
      they might not be doing\\nhigh-quality research. Of course, we all want to tell
      our students to\\ndream big and ideally, we also provide them with the protected
      space to\\ndevelop their own research and strive for the highest quality. However,\\nif
      in the meantime we also encourage them to focus on chasing after\\ngroundbreaking
      results and judge success mainly by how many times our\\nwork gets cited by
      others, we create a culture where short-termism and\\nrisk aversion thrive.
      This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\\nsecure funding in competitive
      four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\\nvery hard for researchers to do
      long-term, risky projects, or work in\\nfields that have a big impact on society
      but don\\\\'t get cited as much,\\nlike applied sciences or social sciences.
      As a result, research agendas\\ndon\\\\'t always focus on what society really
      needs. Also, all this\\ncompetition can make scientists less likely to collaborate,
      which is\\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\\n\\nTo make science better,
      we need to change our priorities, and support a\\nwider range of research. We
      very urgently need more diverse perspectives\\nand inclusive participation in
      science. [We need to collaborate and open\\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\\nreally need to rethink
      the criteria for excellent research. These\\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
      because research evaluation has the\\npower to affect the culture of research;
      individual career trajectories\\nand researchers' well-being; the quality of
      evidence informing policy\\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in research
      and research\\nfunding.\\n\\nI would also like to address a misunderstanding
      about the Dutch\\n['recognition and rewards'\\nprogram](https://recognitionrewards.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.

      my answer to\\nthis question would be: yes and no.\\n\\nLet me start with the
      latter.\\n\\nNo, the last thing contemporary science needs are heroes. What
      it does\\nneed is structural reform. Science suffers from major flaws, including\\nvarious
      forms of bias, structural inequality, lack of transparency and\\nrigor, excessive
      competition, commercialization, and vanity publishing.\\nIt is unhealthy for
      researchers to want to be a hero in the current\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut also: yes!
      Science is in dire need of heroes! Because the science\\nsystem needs to reform,
      we need different types of people who can lead\\nthe way and set an example
      with good leadership. This is what I want to\\naddress in this commentary.\\n\\n<figure

      Commons</a></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\nBut first, and inspired by Museum
      Boerhaave\\\\'s wonderful collection, I\\nwill go back to the 19^th^ century,
      when the first university ranking\\nwas conceived. People often think the first
      ranking appeared around the\\n2000s, with the publication of the first commercial
      ranking. But that is\\nnot true. As is more often the case, problematic metrics
      for assessing\\nexcellence are in fact invented by scientists themselves!\\n\\nA
      few years ago, I examined the work of the American psychologist James\\nMcKeen
      Cattell [with two of my\\ncolleagues](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11024-017-9329-x.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nCattell
      lived from 1860 to 1944, served as the long-time editor of the\\njournal *Science*,
      and his primary academic interest was the study of\\n\\\\'eminence\\\\', a somewhat
      ambiguous concept that I translate here as\\nexcellence, eminence, or greatness.
      There is an interesting connection\\nbetween Cattell\\\\'s work on \\\\'eminence\\\\'
      as the primary \\\\'virtue\\\\' of\\nindividual researchers and the contemporary
      university rankings of the\\nmost prestigious, high-performing, Nobel Prize-winning
      universities with\\nthe most flourishing research and best teaching environments.\\n\\nCattell
      studied in England and later held an office in Cambridge, where\\nhe eventually
      came into contact with proponents of eugenics. Cattell,\\nand many other contemporaries
      interested in \\\\'eminence\\\\' or greatness,\\nobserved a decrease in the
      number of \\\\'great men\\\\' compared to earlier\\nperiods, which they found
      concerning. They feared the biological\\ndegeneration of the population, and
      this fear was exacerbated by a more\\ngeneral concern about the decline of the
      British Empire. This fear was\\nfurther intensified by the rise of industrialization,
      democratization,\\nand a growing working class. The preoccupation with \\\\'great
      men\\\\' was\\nalso reflected in a growing interest in the role of the scientist
      in a\\ntime when scientific work increasingly became a \\\\'profession\\\\'
      among\\nother professions. The scientific method of eugenics gave Cattell the\\ntools
      to classify \\\\'eminence\\\\' in a new way. His idea was that\\nprofessors
      could be placed on a single ranked list based on peer review.\\nHe asked a large
      number of scientists to create a list, ranking\\nscientists from the most to
      the least prominent, based on a selection of\\nnames provided in advance. High
      \\\\\\\"output\\\\\\\" was insufficient as an\\nindicator of \\\\'eminence\\\\';
      it was primarily about reputation among\\npeers. What exactly this reputation
      was based on remained ambiguous.\\nCattell kept various background and biographical
      information about the\\nmen on the lists, including data on birthplace, residence,
      age, and\\nespecially the university where researchers had received their\\neducation.
      But his lists also quickly started to serve other purposes:\\nhe mapped how
      \\\\'scientific eminence\\\\' was distributed across cities and\\nuniversities.
      And I quote from a piece in 1903: \\\\\\\"We can tell whether\\nthe average
      scientific standard in one part of the country or at a\\ncertain university
      is higher or lower than elsewhere; we can also\\nquantitatively map the scientific
      strength of a university or\\ndepartment.\\\\\\\" So, initially, Cattell\\\\'s
      lists were not compiled with the\\npurpose of comparing institutions, but the
      information these instruments\\nprovided was indeed used for these comparisons.\\n\\n<figure

      />\\n<figcaption>Table from <a href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1627220\\\"\\ntarget=\\\"_blank\\\">Cattell,
      1898</a>: Doctorates in Philosophy from\\nAmerican universities in a single
      year</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n  \\n\\nCattell\\\\'s study of scientific
      men and his subsequent ranking of\\nuniversities was deeply rooted in a larger
      debate about the role of the\\nscientist. The ideal image of a researcher was
      evolving significantly at\\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
      century, as I think is\\nhappening again today. But back then, older ideas about
      the\\ngentleman-scholar, driven by intrinsic motivation, were increasingly\\njuxtaposed
      with ideals that were more in line with the concept of\\nscience as a paid profession.
      Just as the current preoccupation with\\nexcellence and ranking is related to
      a much broader discussion about\\nwhat universities are exactly for today!\\n\\nOver
      the past 30+ years the Dutch and European governments have\\nintroduced several
      different policy instruments to foster excellent\\nresearch. These policy instruments
      worked by stimulating competition in\\nscience, and what I find very interesting
      is how these research policy\\ninstruments have in the past decades started
      to shape our perception of\\nexcellent science through an interactive feedback
      loop between policy on\\nthe one hand and the practice of doing research on
      the other. An\\nexcellent researcher's standing is now primarily determined
      by their\\nresearch production. This is partly still science as a profession
      that\\nCattell and others instigated, but this profession is now saturated with\\nkey
      performance indicators (like a lot of other professions in\\nneoliberal democratic
      societies). The primary tactical and strategic\\naims have become competing
      for (ever decreasing amounts of) research\\nincome, and publishing in prestigious
      journals, and aiming for a Nobel\\nPrize. Put even stronger, prizes and awards
      have become important parts\\nof academic CVs. And because of gender and other
      diversity gaps, this\\nmakes it harder for women and other minority groups to
      make a career in\\nscience. University rankings use prizes and awards as input,
      and this\\ntrickles down in university policies. Universities over the past
      decades\\nhave started to think in terms of globalised economic markets for\\nexcellent
      researchers.\\n\\nThe motivation behind policies for excellence perhaps at one
      point made\\nsense, and Dutch science is doing well by the numbers, but obviously,\\nand
      this is not often acknowledged, there is a big structural issue with\\nthe way
      we measure excellence. If we are truly honest: current notions\\nof excellence
      and metrics-driven assessment criteria are threatening to\\nshape the content
      of the work and the diversity of the subject matter.\\nWe are observing that
      research is designed and adjusted in a way that\\nensures a good score. We see
      that people are choosing research questions\\nnot just based on interest or
      importance, but also to improve their\\nchances of getting a job. This ['thinking
      with\\nindicators'](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/157/3933574){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nis
      obviously problematic for science when important research questions\\nare not
      being addressed and even become 'unthinkable'.\\n\\nThis type of thinking also
      has consequences for the space in academia\\nfor what you could call 'social'
      elements. Think of decreasing\\ncollegiality, less commitment to the community,
      or bad leadership. And\\nif we\\\\'re mostly noticing and applauding the \\\\'big
      names,\\\\' those\\nveteran academics with a significant reputation, we are
      hurting the\\nopportunities for talented newcomers and other team members who
      play\\ncrucial roles. What worries me is that the pressure in many places is
      so\\nhigh that ambitious young researchers think they cannot go on holiday\\nbecause
      otherwise their work will be 'scooped'. Competitiveness can\\ncreate feelings
      of constant failure among early career researchers, as\\nthey may never feel
      they meet the required standards. And even those who\\nare at the top, and we
      have interviewed many, often feel they must\\ncontinue to work ever harder to
      keep out-competing others. Group leaders\\nand heads of department warn each
      other about the health risks that they\\nrun by chronically working very hard,
      year after year. This is an actual\\nquote from an actual interview:  \\n\\nThe
      example these senior researchers are setting with that behaviour to\\ntheir
      younger colleagues is that it is heroic to work eighty hours a\\nweek, and that
      if people can't keep up, they are not fit for the\\nChampions League. These
      senior researchers have really internalised that\\nthis is what it takes to
      play the game, and that if you can't stand the\\nheat, you should get out of
      the kitchen. But let's face it, that kitchen\\nis on fire.\\n\\nFor one, we
      have globally had several severe integrity and\\nreproducibility crises. We
      have seen the shadow side of competition,\\nwhere researchers focus too much
      on finding new things and trying to do\\nthat quickly, even if that means that
      they might not be doing\\nhigh-quality research. Of course, we all want to tell
      our students to\\ndream big and ideally, we also provide them with the protected
      space to\\ndevelop their own research and strive for the highest quality. However,\\nif
      in the meantime we also encourage them to focus on chasing after\\ngroundbreaking
      results and judge success mainly by how many times our\\nwork gets cited by
      others, we create a culture where short-termism and\\nrisk aversion thrive.
      This culture is today also driven by a pressure to\\nsecure funding in competitive
      four-year cycles. This, in turn, makes it\\nvery hard for researchers to do
      long-term, risky projects, or work in\\nfields that have a big impact on society
      but don\\\\'t get cited as much,\\nlike applied sciences or social sciences.
      As a result, research agendas\\ndon\\\\'t always focus on what society really
      needs. Also, all this\\ncompetition can make scientists less likely to collaborate,
      which is\\ncrucial for solving complex problems.\\n\\nTo make science better,
      we need to change our priorities, and support a\\nwider range of research. We
      very urgently need more diverse perspectives\\nand inclusive participation in
      science. [We need to collaborate and open\\nup,](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/08/14/the-benefits-of-open-science-are-not-inevitable-monitoring-its-development-should-be-value-led/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nsimply
      because what is expected of science today greatly exceeds the\\nproblem-solving
      capacity of science alone. And that is why we also\\nreally need to rethink
      the criteria for excellent research. These\\ncriteria need to be more inclusive,
      because research evaluation has the\\npower to affect the culture of research;
      individual career trajectories\\nand researchers' well-being; the quality of
      evidence informing policy\\nmaking; and importantly, the priorities in research
      and research\\nfunding.\\n\\nI would also like to address a misunderstanding
      about the Dutch\\n['recognition and rewards'\\nprogram](https://recognitionrewards.nl/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.
      I often hear\\na concern that the program wants to wishy-washily include everyone
      and\\nforgets about upholding excellence. I do not think that this is a fair\\nportrayal
      of the program. At its core, the program is about an honest\\nlook in the mirror,
      and about fixing what is broken. The program is part\\nof a much larger set
      of national, regional, and global initiatives\\nincluding the [DORA Declaration](https://sfdora.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nand
      the [Leiden Manifesto for research\\nmetrics](https://www.nature.com/articles/520429a){target=\\\"_blank\\\"},

      the global [UNESCO Recommendation on Open\\nScience](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nAll
      these initiatives are part of a global effort to re-think\\nevaluation. And
      we need other types of leaders and heroes in academia,\\nwho will work together
      to implement responsible forms of research\\nassessment. We should stop sending
      each other the message that\\nregardless of how hard we all work, there is always
      more we need to do\\nto succeed. If we want our work to be meaningful, we need
      to invest more\\nin building strong academic communities that value collaboration
      and\\nshare a commitment to advancing research and teaching, while making a\\npositive
      impact on and with society.\\n\\nOne of my heroes in life is Pippi Langstr\xF6m,
      or Pippie Langkous in\\nDutch. I used to watch her show when I was little. Pippi
      has this\\nsaying: \\\"I have never tried this before, so I think I should definitely\\nbe
      able to do that.\\\" I love it. And I believe that we need to reward\\nthis
      type of behaviour more than we currently do in academia, sadly. We\\nshould
      foster taking risks, trying something new, stepping out of our\\ncomfort zone,
      and being bold whilst not taking ourselves too seriously.\\nBut in fact, we
      see the opposite happen among early career researchers.\\nMany of them suffer
      from [anxiety and an unhealthy pressure to conform\\nto a problematic\\nnorm](https://hetpnn.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306_Improving-mental-health-of-early-career-researchers-2.pdf){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\nHelping
