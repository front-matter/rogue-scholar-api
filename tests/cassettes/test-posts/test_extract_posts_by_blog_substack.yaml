      Haley</a></p></li></ul><p>(There are plenty more responses; if I didn\u2019t
      list yours, sorry!)</p><p>For the most part, I agree with these responses. Physical
      organic thinking has permeated organic chemistry and adjacent fields: George
      Whitesides has probably <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijch.201500061\\\">the
      best piece on this topic</a>, in which he argues that the essence of physical
      organic chemistry is \u201Ca general, and remarkably versatile, method for tackling
      complex problems,\u201D not anything about chemistry per se, and consequently
      that the physical organic mindset can be applied to problems in all manner of
      fields. Viewed from this angle, we might say that physical organic chemistry
      hasn\u2019t disappeared at all\u2014instead, it\u2019s become so commonplace
      that we forget to acknowledge it as distinctive at all.</p><p>Looking through
      the organic chemistry curriculum, too, suggests that physical organic chemistry
      is here to stay. Lots of the ideas that we teach to undergraduates, like molecular
      orbital theory and structure\u2013activity relationships, were once distinctively
      the domain of physical organic chemists. Textbooks from before the apotheosis
      of physical organic chemistry (I have an old copy of Fieser &amp; Fieser, for
      instance) are structured in a completely different way, not by mechanism but
      by functional group, while today many undergraduate organic classes discuss
      S<sub>N</sub>1/S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms in their first semester.</p><p>So,
      was I entirely wrong to claim that traditional physical organic chemistry is
      a dying art? I don\u2019t think so. Despite all the successes of physical organic
      chemistry, it seems to me that something has been lost between the time of the
      norbornyl cation controversy and today. The sorts of elegant kinetic experimentation
      and argumentation that Winstein and others employed in their papers are now
      rare: take, for instance, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01583a022\\\">this
      famous paper</a> distinguishing between contact ion pairs and solvent-separated
      ion pairs. How many scientists today still do experiments like this? There are
      certainly names that come to mind, but from where I sit it seems to be an increasingly
      niche skillset.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link

      don\u2019t want to fall into the trap of idolizing the past for no reason; there
      are plenty of techniques which have been forgotten by chemistry because there
      are better ways of doing the same thing today. Chemists used to estimate molecular
      weight by dissolving a known mass of sample and measuring the boiling point
      elevation induced. Now we have mass spectrometry, so nobody uses the boiling
      point method any more, and I don\u2019t see this as a great tragedy.</p><p>But
      kinetics, and more generally the sort of careful physical organic chemistry
      practiced by participants in the norbornyl cation debate, doesn\u2019t seem
      to have such a simple replacement. Computation is the most obvious candidate,
      but we\u2019re still a long way away from being able to predict mechanisms accurately
      <em>in silico</em>; in mechanistic chemistry, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja5111392\\\">experiments
      still reign supreme</a>. Kinetic isotope effects are much easier to measure
      than they were back in Winstein\u2019s day, but they\u2019re hardly routine
      experiments (and easy to get wrong). The rigor and precision with which old-school
      physical organic chemistry approached mechanistic problems can still be found
      today, but it seems harder and harder to find.</p><p>It might have been inevitable
      that physical organic chemistry was always going to evolve away from incredibly
      detailed studies of simple reactions on simple molecules\u2014just as biology
      has largely shifted from ecology and taxonomy to cell biology and biochemistry,
      organic chemistry too must change in order to keep working on the most interesting
      problems. And perhaps there's some truth to the argument that the old-school
      style of painstaking mechanistic study just isn't worth the effort and deserves
      to be de-emphasized. But it does seem to me that parts of the tradition of physical
      organic knowledge (to borrow <a href=\\\"https://samoburja.com/on-the-loss-and-preservation-of-knowledge/\\\">Samo
      Burja\u2019s phrasing</a>) is being slowly lost to time, despite the fact that
      lots of really good physical organic chemistry is still being done today on
      all sorts of problems (enzymatic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, catalysis,
      heterogenous catalysis, chemical biology, &amp;c), and that makes me sad.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"In

      (C14\u2013C18 in Rowan) is markedly shorter than a normal C\u2013C bond, whereas
      the C1\u2013C6 and C2\u2013C6 bonds (C13\u2013C14 and C14\u2013C18 in Rowan)
      are quite long.</p><p><em>(can\u2019t display inline, but <a href=\\\"https://labs.rowansci.com/public/calculations/75efc4da-b19c-42d4-a49c-cb454741cb93\\\">here\u2019s
      a link</a>)</em></p><p>In the 1960s Winstein\u2019s interpretation was challenged
      by another preeminent chemist, H.C. Brown, who argued that the data could adequately
      be explained by rapidly equilibrating classical carbocations. Brown suggested
      that most of the observations made by Winstein could be explained simply by
      the differing steric profiles of the <em>exo</em> and <em>endo</em> faces of
      the norbornyl cation: the <em>endo</em> face is more shielded, and so ionization
      is slowed (explaining the 350:1 <em>exo</em>/<em>endo</em> rates) and attack
      is disfavored (explaining why both isomers of sulfonate give <em>exo</em> product).</p><p>This
      began an incredibly contentious series of debates which dragged on for decades.
      Rather than attempt to wade through the resulting sea of publications, I\u2019ll
      quote from <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar00096a004\\\">an
      excellent 1983 review</a> by Cheves Walling to give a sense for the magnitude
      of the controversy:</p><blockquote><p>The debate [over the structure of the
      norbornyl cation] was vigorously pursued verbally in lectures, meetings, and
      seminars all over the U.S. and even abroad\u2026. No one has ever counted the
      number of publications touching on the 2-norbornyl cation problem, but they
      include a number of reviews, chapters, and books, and a typcial <em>[sic]</em>
      research paper may well include references to over 100 others.</p></blockquote><p>Walling\u2019s
      review goes on to give an excellent overview of the various pieces of evidence
      employed by both sides of the debate, which I won\u2019t summarize in full here.</p><p>The
      most important data was obtained by George Olah and co-workers, who pioneered
      the use of superacidic media to generate stable solutions of carbocations which
      could be characterized spectroscopically. With Martin Saunders and others, Olah
      employed <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy,
      Raman spectroscopy, and core electron spectroscopy to study low-temperature
      solutions of norbornyl cations: in all cases, the data supported Winstein\u2019s
      proposed symmetric structure. (While equilibration occurring faster than the
      spectroscopic timescale could not be ruled out by Olah\u2019s work, spectroscopic
      measurements all the way down to 5 K showed no detectable classical structures,
      indicating that any barrier to interconversion must be &lt;0.2 kcal/mol.)</p><div

      of the exo sulfonate, the authors find the nonclassical cation is formed on
      average within 9 femtoseconds of C\u2013O bond cleavage, which is about as quickly
      as is physically possible. Once formed, the cation is entirely nonclassical:

      presentation</a>.</p><div><hr></div><p>What can modern scientists learn from
      the norbornyl cation controversy, besides the object-level fact that carbocations
      can exhibit nonclassical \u03C3-delocalization?</p><h3><strong>1. Reality is
      confusing, and convincing arguments are often wrong.</strong></h3><p>It\u2019s
      a good exercise to go back and read the early H.C. Brown papers in this area,
      like <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar50071a003\\\">this account</a>.
      Brown was an incredible scientist (the 1979 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and
      his data and reasoning are quite good; I find myself sympathizing with his viewpoint
      while reading his papers. Nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight we know
      that he was wrong and Winstein was right. \u201CHumility comes before honor.\u201D</p><h3><strong>2.
      Tools drive scientific progress.</strong></h3><p>The argument over the norbornyl
      cation was ultimately settled only by the development of new techniques, like
      superacid chemistry, core electron spectroscopy, and high-level calculations.
      Now that we have these methods, it\u2019s much easier to solve similar problems:
      if Winstein\u2019s paper came out today, I doubt it would take more than a year
      or two to figure everything out.</p><p>This aligns nicely with what <a href=\\\"https://estudosdects.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dyson-science-ideas-or-tools.pdf\\\">Freeman
      Dyson</a> calls a \u201CGalisonian\u201D view of scientific progress, where
      scientific progress is driven not by ideas (the \u201CKuhnian\u201D view) but
      by new tools and new data. In chemistry, at least, the tools-first view seems
      true to me\u2014since 1950, it\u2019s difficult to think of a development more
      important to organic chemistry than NMR spectroscopy, with flash column chromatography
      probably taking second place.</p><h3><strong>3. It\u2019s easy for fields to
      get distracted by controversy and lose relevance.</strong></h3><p>Here\u2019s
      Walling again:</p><blockquote><p>Since a significant fraction of the efforts
      of physical organic chemists was drawn into the problem [of the norbornyl cation],
      an unhappy consequence was a feeling on the part of many (including some of
      those concerned with the distribution of research funds) that physical organic
      chemistry was in danger of withdrawing into a world of its own.</p></blockquote><p>As
      older scientists have explained to me, the norbornyl cation debacle scared a
      generation of chemists away from physical organic chemistry. The entire subfield
      became obsessed with a niche and somewhat irrelevant issue, while scientists
      in adjacent subfields looked on with bemusement and frustration. As a consequence,
      traditional physical organic chemistry is barely practiced today: few scientists
      have the skill or knowledge to conduct kinetic studies like those performed
      by Winstein, Brown, and others, and those still working in the area struggle
      to get funding or recognition (in the words of Dan Singleton, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1275932027825664000\\\">\u201Csucks
      when you have to peddle your papers in cemeteries\u201D</a>).</p><p>(In <a href=\\\"http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p123-131.pdf\\\">a
      nice historical perspective</a>, Stephen Weininger argues the norbornyl cation
      debate was \u201Ca hook on which to hang a much larger agenda,\u201D fueled
      both by a UK/US divide and a deeper dispute about whether valence bond representations
      or molecular orbital representations of chemical structures were superior. If
      this is true, it was a self-defeating exercise by all involved.)</p><p>Scientists
      should be motivated by a search for truth, but also by the desire to improve
      the world. Usually these two aims go together: basic research without obvious
      societal implications often leads to unexpected and important findings, which
      is why the government supports science in the first place. But it\u2019s possible
      to become so myopically focused on a single issue in the name of truth that
      one forgets about other goals, as arguably happened in the norbornyl cation
      imbroglio.</p><p>Controversy attracts attention: we\u2019re drawn to it, against
      our better judgment, like moths to a flame. We have to be careful not to get
      captured by disputes that are, in the long run, not worth the effort.</p><p><em>Thanks

      didn\u2019t really appreciate the \u201Cspeculative governance futurism\u201D/\u201Dcomparative
      cultural criticism\u201D facets of the novel when I read this in high school.</p><p><strong>#7.
      Richard Hamming, </strong><em><strong>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</strong></em></p><p>I
      reviewed this <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230516_hamming.html\\\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>#8-11.
      Brandon Sanderson, </strong><em><strong>The Stormlight Archives</strong></em></p><p>Many
      great works of literature are notable for their brevity: when you read Hemingway,
      or <em>Dubliners</em>, or Flannery O\u2019Connor, you know that every sentence
      has been crafted with care. Giant fantasy novels like <em>Wheel of Time</em>
      (which I read last year) or <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> work differently.
      There are entire chapters which are probably extraneous, whole characters and
      plot arcs which exist merely to bring out certain traits or pieces of information.</p><p>But
      there are unique joys to megafiction: sitting down and reading hundreds of pages
      of a good story is relaxing in a way that other books simply aren\u2019t. In
      my own life, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m much better about making time to
      read when I\u2019m in the middle of an engaging novel than when I\u2019m reading
      theology or histories of feudalism. Narrative-driven \u201Ceasy reading\u201D
      has a bad reputation amongst the literati; in a world where all fiction is competing
      against screens for engagement, it shouldn\u2019t.</p><p><strong>#12. Antonio

      Geoffrey Chaucer, </strong><em><strong>The Canterbury Tales</strong></em></p><p>The
      best book I read this year by a mile; far better than I remembered. While many
      of <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> work pretty well as literature, they\u2019re
      even better when viewed also as history. It\u2019s rare to be able to read something
      from 800 years ago that\u2019s legitimately funny and interesting.</p><p>Reading
      Chaucer fills me with questions about the medieval mind. The stories are steeped
      in Christianity, as one might expect. Any argument goes back to the Bible, even
      those among animals, and Chaucer assumes a level of familiarity with e.g. the
      Psalms far exceeding that of most modern Christians. Yet at the same time the
      Greco-Roman world looms large: Roman gods appear as plot characters in three
      tales (the Knight\u2019s Tale, the Merchant\u2019s Tale, and the Manciple\u2019s
      Tale), and Seneca is viewed as a moral authority on par with Scripture. I\u2019m
      curious how all these beliefs and ideas fit together and welcome any recommendations
      on this subject. (<em>The Discarded Image</em> is already on my list.)</p><p><strong>#27.
      Gabrielle Zevin, </strong><em><strong>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</strong></em></p><p>My
      wife recommended this book to me. I thought this would be a relaxing break from
      the November startup grind, but in fact it features a bunch of obsessed programmers
      working around the clock for months\u2014a poor choice but a good novel.</p><p><strong>#28.
      Jessica Livingston, </strong><em><strong>Founders at Work</strong></em><br><strong>#29.
      Neal Stephenson, </strong><em><strong>Seveneves</strong></em><br><br></p><p>Overall,
      about a third of the books I read were startup-related: most of them were pretty
      bad, but even bad business/startup books are probably useful from the viewpoint
      of cultural immersion. Academic science is quite different from the startup
      ecosystem, and to the extent that cultural arbitrage is possible (in either
      direction), I need to become proficient in startup culture.</p><p>I\u2019m not
      sure why the median business book is so bad\u2014perhaps business people are
      too willing to spend money on books and not picky enough, or perhaps MBA types
      generally lack knowledge about the humanities, which makes both supply and demand
      worse.</p><p>(The median Christian book is also pretty bad. One unifying hypothesis:
      both pastors and businesspeople often have wise insights into specific situations,
      personal or business, but these insights aren\u2019t readily generalizable into
      book form. Being able to give good advice doesn\u2019t mean you should write
      an \u201Cadvice book.\u201D)</p><p>As always, book recommendations are welcome,
      particularly on the topics of medieval history/culture, software engineering,
      or startups. Apologies for the infrequent posting as of late, and happy new
      year!</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"(Previously:

      machine learning becomes more and more important to chemistry, it\u2019s worth
      reflecting on Richard Sutton\u2019s 2019 blog post about the \u201Cbitter lesson.\u201D
      In <a href=\\\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\\\">this
      now-famous post</a>, Sutton argues that \u201Cthe biggest lesson that can be
      read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation
      are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.\u201D This might sound
      obvious, but it\u2019s not:</p><blockquote><p>[The bitter lesson] is a big lesson.
      As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to
      make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we
      have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter
      lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run.
      The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers
      have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps
      in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in
      the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough
      progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation
      by search and learning. <strong>The eventual success is tinged with bitterness,
      and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric
      approach.</strong> <em>(emphasis added)</em></p></blockquote><p>How might the
      bitter lesson be relevant in chemistry? One example is computer-assisted retrosynthesis
      in organic synthesis, i.e. figuring out how to make a given target from commercial
      starting materials. This task was first attempted by Corey\u2019s LHASA program
      (<a href=\\\"https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2549520/component/file_3325899/content\\\">1</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/corey-lecture.pdf\\\">2</a>),
      and more recently has been addressed by Bartosz Gryzbowski\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/chem/pdf/S2451-9294(18)30085-8.pdf\\\">Synthia</a>.
      Despite considerable successes, both efforts have operated through manual encoding
      of human chemical intuition. If Sutton is to be believed, we should be pessimistic
      about the scalability and viability of such approaches relative to pure search-based
      alternatives in the coming years.</p><p>Another example is machine-learned force
      fields (like ANI or NequIP). While one could argue that equivariant neural networks
      like <em>e3nn</em> aren\u2019t so much incorporating domain-specific knowledge
      as exploiting relevant symmetries (much like convolutional neural networks exploit
      translational symmetry in images), there\u2019s been a movement in recent years
      to combine chemistry-specific forces (e.g. long-range Coulombic forces) with
      neural networks: Parkhill\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc04934j\\\">TensorMol</a>
      did this back in 2018, and more recently <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27340-2\\\">Dral</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08734\\\">Piquemal</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c07628\\\">Levitt
      &amp; Fain</a> (<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/olexandr/status/1730604569028092081\\\">among
      others</a>) have published on this as well. While I\u2019m no expert in this
      area, the bitter lesson suggests that we should be skeptical about the long-term
      viability of efforts, and instead just throw more data at chemistry-agnostic
      models.</p><p>A key assumption of the bitter lesson is that \u201Cover a slightly
      longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably
      becomes available.\u201D This idea has also been discussed by Andrej Karpathy,
      who <a href=\\\"https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/\\\">reproduced</a>
      Yann LeCun\u2019s landmark 1989 backpropagation paper last year using state-of-the-art
      techniques and reflected on how the field has progressed since then. In particular,
      Karpathy discussed how the last three decades of progress in ML can help us
      envision what the next three decades might look like:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose
      that the lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time. What does that imply
      about deep learning of 2022? What would a time traveler from 2055 think about
      the performance of current networks?</p><ul><li><p>2055 neural nets are basically
      the same as 2022 neural nets on the macro level, except bigger.</p></li><li><p>Our
      datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere around 10,000,000X
      larger.</p></li><li><p>One can train 2022 state of the art models in ~1 minute
      by training naively on their personal computing device as a weekend fun project.</p></li><li><p>Today\u2019s
      models are not optimally formulated, and just changing some of the details of
      the model, loss function, augmentation or the optimizer we can about halve the
      error.</p></li><li><p>Our datasets are too small, and modest gains would come
      from scaling up the dataset alone.</p></li><li><p>Further gains are actually
      not possible without expanding the computing infrastructure and investing into
      some R&amp;D on effectively training models on that scale.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>If
      we take this seriously, we might expect that chemical ML will not be able to
      advance much farther without bigger datasets and bigger models. Today, experimental
      datasets rarely exceed 10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup> data points, and even
      computational datasets typically comprise 10<sup>7</sup> data points or fewer\u2014compare
      this to the ~10<sup>13</sup> tokens <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/\\\">reportedly
      used to train GPT-4</a>! It\u2019s not obvious how to get experimental datasets
      that are this large. HTE and robotics will help, but five orders of magnitude
      is a big ask. Even all of Reaxys doesn\u2019t get you to 10<sup>8</sup>, poor
      data quality notwithstanding. (It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that DNA-encoded
      libraries, which can actually have hundreds of millions of data points, also
      pair nicely with ML: I\u2019ve written about this <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230403_industry.html\\\">before</a>.)</p><p>In
      contrast, computation permits the predictable generation of high-quality datasets.
      If Sutton is right about the inevitable availability of \u201Cmassively more
      computation,\u201D then we can expect it to become easier and easier to run
      hitherto expensive calculations like DFT in parallel to generate huge datasets,
      and to enable more and more downstream applications like chemical machine learning.
      With the right infrastructure (like Rowan, hopefully), it should be possible
      to turn computer time into high-quality chemical data with almost no non-financial
      scaling limit: <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300415d\\\">we\u2019re
      certainly not going to run out of molecules</a>.</p><p>The advent of big data,
      though, heralds the decline of academic relevance. Julian Togelius and Georgios
      Yannakakis wrote about this earlier this year in a piece on <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03\\\">\u201Csurvival
      strategies for depressed AI academics,\u201D</a> which discusses the fact that
      \u201Cthe gap between the amount of compute available to ordinary researchers
      and the amount available to stay competitive is growing every year.\u201D For
      instance, GPT-4 reportedly cost c. $60 million to train, far surpassing any
      academic group\u2019s budget. Togelius and Yannakakis provide a lot of potential
      solutions, some sarcastic (\u201Cgive up\u201D) and others quite constructive\u2014for
      instance, lots of interpretability work (<a href=\\\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html\\\">like
      this</a>) is done on toy models that don\u2019t require GPT-4 levels of training.
      Even the most hopeful scenarios they present, however, still leave academics
      with a rather circumscribed role in the ML ecosystem.</p><p>The present academic
      era of chemical machine learning can thus be taken as a sign of the field\u2019s
      immaturity. When will chemical ML reach a Suttonian era where scaling is paramount
      and smaller efforts become increasingly futile? I\u2019m not sure, but my guess
      is that it will happen when (and only when) there are clear commercial incentives
      for developing sophisticated models, enabling companies to sink massive amounts
      of capital into training and development. This clearly hasn\u2019t happened
      yet, but it also might not be as far away as it seems (<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9\\\">cf.</a>).

      what your instincts tell you to do.</p><p>If you believe Bill Carr and Colin
      Bryar\u2019s book on Amazon, <em><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1250267595\\\">Working
      Backwards</a></em>, Amazon\u2019s success can be understood in similar terms.
      According to Carr and Bryar, Amazon alone among the West Coast zaibatsu has
      succeeded not because of some big technical or social insight (Google Search,
      Windows) but because of a long series of canny business decisions. Bezos has
      said something similar: \u201CAmazon doesn't have one big advantage, so we have
      to braid a rope out of many small advantages.\u201D The implication is that
      you too can build an Amazon-quality firm; you don\u2019t need any flashes of
      mad genius, just the ability to eke out small advantages through savvy management.</p><p>(This
      might seem like an insane claim, but it\u2019s worth noting that Amazon has
      indeed launched a ton of successful and loosely coupled businesses: in addition
      to their core commerce business, there\u2019s AWS, Amazon Robotics, Kindle,
      Prime Video, Fire TV, and a bunch of other stuff. Contrast this to Google\u2019s
      recent track record\u2026)</p><p>What\u2019s more, Carr and Bryar go on to argue
      that Amazon\u2019s business acumen is driven not by some inscrutable Bezos magic
      but by adherence to a simple set of principles. And these principles aren\u2019t
      esoteric or Amazon-specific\u2014almost any business can follow them. The reason
      so few businesses have copied Amazon\u2019s success is simply because each principle
      defies human nature in some way. Just like pistol shooting requires one to unlearn
      one\u2019s instincts and pull the trigger without moving any other muscles,
      being an \u201CAmazonian\u201D business requires discarding what you think you
      understand about building a business and going back to basics.</p><p>So, what
      are these magic principles?</p><h2><strong>1. Focus on Customers, Not Competitors</strong></h2><p>Focusing
      on competitors is human nature\u2014in a competition, we judge ourselves based
      on our rivals, and like to imagine how we\u2019ll defeat them. But success in
      business comes from satisfied customers, not vanquished foes, and keeping a
      relentless focus on users/customers is what\u2019s key to building something
      great. This is hardly Amazon-specific advice: \u201Cbuild something people want\u201D
      is <a href=\\\"https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice\\\">venerable
      YC advice</a>, and <em>Zero to One</em> also makes the point that competition
      is bad, and focusing on it counterproductive. Perhaps the fact that so many
      different people feel the need to emphasize this speaks to the fact that it\u2019s
      very counterintuitive: if it were widely adopted, it wouldn\u2019t need to be
      said.</p><p>Plenty of people outside business get this idea wrong. A few weeks
      ago, a friend was explaining how he feels that many computational chemists are
      making software not for users but for other computational chemists. This is
      a case in which writing papers leads to different incentives than releasing
      products: papers are reviewed by one\u2019s peers (other computational chemists),
      while products are ultimately reviewed by users. Hopefully Rowan doesn\u2019t
      make this mistake\u2026</p><h2><strong>2. \u201CBar Raisers\u201D: External
      Vetos in Hiring</strong></h2><p>Amazon includes a person called a \u201CBar
      Raiser\u201D involved in all hiring decisions, who isn\u2019t the hiring manager
      (the person who is trying to acquire a new team member) but who has final veto
      power on any potential hire. The hiring manager is hiring because they need
      help in the short term, so they\u2019re typically willing to engage in wishful
      thinking and lower their standards\u2014but the Bar Raiser (who\u2019s just
      another Amazon employee, with a bit of extra training) has no such incentives
      and can make sure that no poor performers are hired, which is better for Amazon
      in the long run.</p><p>I like this idea because it\u2019s a nice example of
      mechanism design: just a little bit of internal red-teaming on all decisions,
      which (according to the book) works quite well. (Red teaming is another one
      of those \u201Cgood but counterintuitive practices\u201D which seems underutilized\u2014see
      <a href=\\\"https://open.substack.com/pub/statecraftnotes/p/how-to-predict-the-future?r=5jsaw&amp;selection=302a6711-1b29-4791-aedc-0320932bac7a&amp;utm_campaign=post-share-selection&amp;utm_medium=web\\\">the
      discussion</a> in a recent <em>Statecraft</em> interview.)</p><h2><strong>3.
      Problem-Focused, Not Skills-Focused</strong></h2><p>It\u2019s natural to think
      about what we should do next in terms of what we\u2019re good at: \u201CI\u2019m
      good at X, how can I use X to solve a problem?\u201D Carr and Bryar argue that
      \u201Cworking forwards\u201D in this way is stupid, because only at the end
      do you think about who (if anyone) might care if you succeed. \u201CWorking
      backwards\u201D from problem to solution is a much better strategy: first you
      articulate what you might need to accomplish to produce a compelling solution,
      and then you think about if you can do it. Inside Amazon, most potential new
      projects start out by drafting what the press release might be if the project
      is finished, and then working backwards from the press release to what the product
      must be. (Most products envisioned in this way never actually get developed,
      which is exactly the point of the exercise.)</p><p><a href=\\\"https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf\\\">George
      Whitesides</a> has advocated for a similar way to approach science: first write
      the paper, then conduct the experiments. Lots of scientists I know find this
      repulsive, or contrary to how science should be practiced, but it always seemed
      shrewd to me\u2014if you can\u2019t make an interesting paper out of what you\u2019re
      doing, why are you doing it? (Some exploratory work is tough to outline in this
      way, but there should be several potential papers in those cases, not none.)</p><h2><strong>4.
      Single-Threaded Leadership</strong></h2><p>As organizations scale, it becomes
      tougher and tougher to allow teams to work autonomously: to quote Amazon SVP
      of Devices Dave Limp: \u201CThe best way to fail at inventing something is by
      making it somebody\u2019s part-time job.\u201D Amazon\u2019s solution is the
      idea of single-threaded leadership (STL, probably someone\u2019s idea of C++
      humor). Organizations need to be arranged such that individual teams can respond
      to their problems intelligently and independently, planning and shipping features
      on their own, and each team needs to have a \u201Csingle-threaded leader\u201D
      who\u2019s solely responsible for that team.</p><p>Instituting STL takes a good
      amount of initial planning, since dividing up a giant monolith into loosely
      coupled components is tough both for software and for humans, and it\u2019s
      not in the nature of authorities to relinquish control. If done properly, though,
      this allows innovation to happen much faster than if every decision is bottlenecked
      by reliance on the C-suite. (It\u2019s sorta like federalism for businesses.)</p><p>This
      idea matters for labs, too: some research groups rely on their PI for scientific
      direction in every project, while others devolve a lot of authority to individual
      students. The latter seem more productive to me.</p><h2><strong>5. Bias Towards
      Action</strong></h2><p>Humans are by nature conservative, and sins of commission
      frequently feel worse than sins of omission\u2014making a bad decision can cost
      you your job, while not making a good decision often goes unnoticed (the <a
      href=\\\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html\\\">\u201Cinvisible
      graveyard\u201D</a>). To counteract this, Amazon expects leaders to display
      a \u201CBias for Action.\u201D In their words:</p><blockquote><p>Speed matters
      in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive
      study. We value calculated risk-taking.</p></blockquote><p>Again, this echoes
      classic startup advice: \u201Claunch now,\u201D \u201Cdo things that don\u2019t
      scale,\u201D &amp;c.</p><h2><strong>6. No Powerpoint!</strong></h2><p>In June
      2004, Amazon banned PowerPoint presentations from meetings, instead expecting
      presenters to compose six-page documents which the entire team would read, silently,
      at the beginning of each meeting. Why? A few reasons:</p><ul><li><p>PowerPoint
      lends itself poorly to complex or nuanced ideas, whereas written documents can
      contain more information and more complete chains of reasoning.</p></li><li><p>PowerPoint
      leads to \u201Cslick,\u201D well-rehearsed presentations where the presenter\u2019s
      style and charisma matters as much as the underlying ideas.</p></li><li><p>Writing
      enforces greater clarity of thought than speaking.</p></li><li><p>PowerPoint
      makes the audience passive, while reading makes the audience active participants
      in the ideas. People like to be passive, and it\u2019s fun to hear an inspiring
      presentation, but in the long run it\u2019s better for everyone to actually
      engage.</p></li></ul><p>I\u2019m pretty sympathetic to these criticisms. Most
      high-stakes academic events today revolve around oral presentations, not papers\u2014although
      papers still matter, doctorates, job offers, and tenure are awarded largely
      on the merits of hour-long talks (<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HeQGQQ0q8\\\">e.g.</a>).
      As a result, I spent a ridiculous amount of my PhD just refining and hearing
      feedback on my presentations, much of which had nothing to do with the underlying
      scientific ideas. Perhaps this focus on showmanship over substance explains
      why so little science today seems genuinely transformational. (It\u2019s also
      worth noting that presenting, much more so than writing, favors charismatic
      Americans over the meek or foreign.)</p><p>There are, of course, more than just
      these six ideas in <em>Working Backwards</em>, but I think this gives a pretty
      good sense of what the book is like. Overall, I\u2019d recommend this book:
      it was interesting throughout (unlike most business-y books), and even if nothing
      in its covers is truly new under the sun, the ideas inside are good enough to
      be worth reviewing periodically. </p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"I

      if our most fundamental assumptions about parenting were wrong? That\u2019s
      the question that Michaeleen Doucleff\u2019s 2021 book <em>Hunt, Gather, Parent</em>
      tries to tackle. <em>Hunt, Gather, Parent</em> (henceforth <em>HGP</em>) documents
      Doucleff\u2019s journey to \u201Cthree of the world\u2019s most venerable cultures\u201D\u2014the
      Maya, the Inuit, and the Hadzabe (in Tanzania)\u2014to learn about how they
      parent their children, and offers helpful advice for parents envious of the
      kind, helpful, and responsible children she observes.</p><p>Doucleff\u2019s
      writing hits some familiar beats: critiques of helicopter parenting, distrust
      of endless after-school activities, and laments about the atomization of our
      society (<a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230306232837/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/\\\">cf.</a>).
      But there are plenty of unexpected insights too. I was convicted by her account
      of how Hadzabe children are given autonomy and responsibilities from a young
      age without being either ignored or micromanaged: her vision of a middle ground
      between <em>K</em>-selected \u201Chelicopter parents\u201D and <em>r</em>-selected
      \u201Cfree-range parents\u201D was compelling.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot to like
      about the parenting depicted in <em>HGP</em>. For instance, Doucleff highlights
      how toddlers\u2019 innate eagerness to help is used by the Maya to build a culture
      of helpfulness (the virtue she calls <em>acomedido</em>) which lasts as they
      grow, whereas American parents generally disregard help from a toddler and thus
      teach kids that their help isn\u2019t valued. On the other hand, I\u2019m not
      compelled by her account of how the Inuit view conflict with their children:</p><blockquote><p>Inuit
      see arguing with children as silly and a waste of time\u2026 because children
      are pretty much illogical beings. When an adult argues with a child, the adult
      stoops to the child\u2019s level\u2026 During my three visits to the Arctic,
      I never once witness a parent argue with a child. I never see a power struggle.
      I never hear nagging or negotiating. Never.</p></blockquote><p>I admit that
      getting into a shouting match with your toddler is pointless, but assuming that
      children are innately devoid of logic seems like an overreaction!</p><p>Astute
      readers might be getting bothered by now, though: why are the Maya\u2014who
      ruled a swath of Central America for over a millennium\u2014included in a book
      ostensibly about \u201Chunter-gatherers and other indigenous cultures with similar
      values\u201D? This highlights a deeper issue I have with <em>HGP</em>, which
      is that it partitions the world neatly into \u201CWesterners\u201D and \u201Ceveryone
      else,\u201D citing Joseph Heinrich\u2019s <em><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World\\\">The
      WEIRDest People in the World</a></em> as its justification. While there are
      certainly many ways in which our own culture is distinct, ours is but one among
      many, and there\u2019s plenty of cultural diversity about which <em>HGP</em>
      is silent.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link

      are no perfect choices in parenting, just tradeoffs all the way down. Our culture\u2019s
      valorization of grindset likely helps us instill ambition and a work ethic in
      our children, but also probably sets them up for depression and other issues

      tough to say, but <em>HGP</em> doesn\u2019t even acknowledge the question.</p><p>There\u2019s
      a deeper truth here, which is that rejecting the status quo isn\u2019t the same
      as proposing an alternative. It\u2019s not unfair to read <em>HGP</em> as an
      account of Doucleff becoming redpilled on parenting and realizing that all her
      assumptions about how to raise her children might be wrong\u2014but, like many
      of the newly redpilled, Doucleff lingers too long in her rebellion and doesn\u2019t
      (in <em>HGP</em>) articulate a satisfying positive vision for what parenting
      should be. There are innumerable cultures out there, each of which doubtless
      parents in a different way, and choosing what practices to adopt from each tradition
      requires wisdom.</p><p>But these aren\u2019t choices we should want Doucleff
      to make for us. In the introduction to <em>HGP</em>, Doucleff writes that \u201Cas
      we move outside the U.S., we\u2019ll start to see the Western approach to parenting
      with fresh eyes,\u201D and this seems true. <em>HGP</em> prompts us to reflect
      on the choices we make as parents and the ways in which we might choose differently,
      and even if you disagree with all of Doucleff\u2019s advice it\u2019s worth

      problems inaccessible to classical computers. Perhaps the best-known example
      of this is <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\\\">Shor\u2019s
      algorithm</a>, which enables integer factorization in polynomial time (in comparison

      pretty tough to actually make quantum computers in the real world, though. There
      are many different strategies for what to make qubits out of: isolated atoms,
      nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds, superconductors, and trapped ions have
      all been proposed. The limited number of qubits accessible by state-of-the-art
      quantum computers, along with the high error rate and short decoherence times,
      means that practical quantum computation is very challenging today. These challenges

      chemistry, which revolves around simulating a quantum system (nuclei and electrons),
      seems like an ideal candidate for quantum computing. And indeed, many people
      have proposed using quantum computers for quantum chemistry, even going so far
      as to call chemistry the \u201Ckiller app\u201D for quantum computation.</p><p>Here
      are a few representative claims:</p><ul><li><p>\u201CFew fields will get value
      from quantum computing as quickly as chemistry. Even today\u2019s supercomputers
      struggle to model a single molecule in its full complexity. We study algorithms
      designed to do what those machines can\u2019t, and power a new era of discovery
      in chemistry, materials, and medicine.\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://research.ibm.com/topics/quantum-chemistry\\\">IBM</a>)</p></li><li><p>\u201CThe
      problem is that most quantum chemical problems scale exponentially with system
      size. And classical computers struggle to cope with this exponential scaling.
      Realistically, they will never enable quantum chemistry to tackle real-world
      systems.\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://www.emdgroup.com/en/research/science-space/envisioning-tomorrow/smarter-connected-world/quantum-computing.html\\\">EMD
      Group</a>)</p></li><li><p>\u201CClassically built computers simply cannot handle
      the level of complexity of substances as commonplace as caffeine\u2026 But if
      future chemists embrace quantum computers, they are likely to be a lot luckier.\u201D
      (<a href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-quantum-computing-could-remake-chemistry/\\\">Scientific
      American</a>)</p></li></ul><p>None of these claims are technically incorrect\u2014there
      <em>is</em> a level of \u201Cfull complexity\u201D to caffeine which we cannot
      model today\u2014but most of them are very misleading. Computational chemistry
      is doing just fine as a field without quantum computers; I don\u2019t think
      there are any deep scientific questions about the nature of caffeine that depend
      on computing its exact electronic structure to the microHartree (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02621\\\">competitions
      between physical chemists notwithstanding</a>).</p><p>(Some other claims about
      quantum computing and chemistry border on the ridiculous: I\u2019m not sure
      what to take away from <a href=\\\"https://nam.org/how-quantum-computing-can-combat-forever-chemicals-29001/?stream=policy-legal&amp;s=03\\\">this
      D-Wave press release</a> which claims that their quantum computer can model
      67 million solutions to the problem of \u201Cforever chemicals\u201D in 13 seconds.
      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum\\\">Dulwich Quantum Computing</a>,
      on Twitter/X, does an excellent job of cataloging such malfeasances.)</p><p>Nevertheless,
      there are many legitimate and exciting applications of quantum computing to
      chemistry. Perhaps the best-known is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE),
      developed by Al\xE1n Aspuru-Guzik and co-workers <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213\\\">in
      2014</a>. The VQE is a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm suitable for the NISQ
      era: it takes a Hartree\u2013Fock calculation as the starting point, and then
      minimizes the energy by optimizing the system classically while evaluating the
      energy with a quantum computer. (If you want to learn more, there are a number
      of easy-to-read introductions to the VQE: here\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://joshuagoings.com/2020/08/20/VQE/\\\">one</a>
      from Joshua Goings, and here\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/\\\">another</a>
      from Pennylane.)</p><p>Another approach, more suitable for fault-tolerant quantum
      computers with large numbers of qubits, is quantum phase estimation. Quantum
      phase estimation, explained nicely by Pennylane <a href=\\\"https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/11/quantum-computing-for-quantum-chemistry-a-brief-perspective/\\\">here</a>,
      works like this: given a unitary operator and a state, the state is projected
      into an eigenstate and the corresponding eigenvalue is returned. (It\u2019s
      not just projected onto an eigenstate randomly; the probability of returning
      a given eigenstate is proportional to the overlap with the input state.) This
      might sound abstract, but the ground-state energy of a molecule is just the
      smallest eigenvalue of its Hamiltonian, so this provides a route to get exact
      ground-state energies, assuming we can generate good enough initial states (again,
      typically a Hartree\u2013Fock calculations).</p><p>Both of these methods are
      pretty exciting, since full configuration interaction (the \u201Ccorrect\u201D
      classical way to get the exact ground-state energy) typically has an <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>!)
      cost, making it prohibitively expensive for anything larger than, like, N<sub>2</sub>.
      Further work has built on these ideas: I don\u2019t have the time or skillset
      to provide a full review of the field, although I\u2019ll note <a href=\\\"https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030307\\\">this
      work</a> from Head-Gordon &amp; friends and <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04351-z\\\">this
      work</a> from Joonho Lee. (<a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34\\\">These</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003\\\">reviews</a>
      provide an excellent overview of different algorithms; I\u2019ll discuss it
      later on.)</p><p>Based on the above description, one might reasonably assume
      that quantum computers offer some sort of dramatic quantum advantage relative
      to their classic congeners. <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02199\\\">Recent
      work</a> from Garnet Chan (and many coworkers) challenges this assumption, though:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026we
      do not find evidence for the exponential scaling of classical heuristics in
      a set of relevant problems. \u2026our results suggest that without new and fundamental
      insights, there may be a lack of generic EQA [exponential quantum advantage]
      in this task. Identifying a relevant quantum chemical system with strong evidence
      of EQA remains an open question.</p></blockquote><p>The authors make many interesting
      points. In particular, they point out that physical systems seem to exhibit
      locality, i.e. if we\u2019re trying to describe some system embedded in a larger
      environment to a given accuracy, then there\u2019s some distance beyond which
      we can ignore the larger environment. This means that there are almost certainly
      polynomial-time classical algorithms out there for all of computational chemistry,
      since at some point increasing system size won\u2019t slow our computations
      down any more.</p><p>This might sound abstract, but the authors point out that
      coupled-cluster theory, which can (in principle) be extended to arbitrary levels
      of precision, can be made to take advantage of locality and scale linearly with
      increasing system size or increasing levels of accuracy. Although such algorithms
      aren\u2019t known for strongly correlated systems, like metallic systems, Chan
      and co-workers argue based on analogy to strongly correlated model systems that
      analogous behavior can be expected.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      above paper is making a very specific point\u2014that exponential quantum advantage
      is unlikely\u2014but doesn\u2019t address whether weaker versions of quantum
      advantage are likely. Could it still be the case that quantum algorithms exhibit
      polynomial quantum advantage, e.g. scaling as <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>) while classical

      recent paper</a>, from scientists at Google and QSimulate, addresses this question
      by looking at the electronic structure of various iron complexes derived from
      cytochrome P450. They find that there\u2019s some evidence that quantum computers
      (using quantum phase estimation) will be able to outcompete the best classical
      methods today (CCSD(T) and DMRG), but it\u2019ll take a really big quantum computer:</p><blockquote><p>Most
      notably, under realistic hardware configurations we predict that the largest
      models of CYP can be simulated with under 100 h of quantum computer time using
      approximately 5 million qubits implementing 7.8 \xD7 10<sup>9</sup> Toffoli
      gates using four T factories. A direct runtime comparison of qubitized phase
      estimation shows a more favorable scaling than DMRG, in terms of bond dimension,
      and indicates future devices can potentially outperform classical machines when
      computing ground-state energies. Extrapolating the observed resource estimates
      to the full Cpd I system and compiling to the surface code indicate that a direct
      simulation of the entire system could require 1.5 trillion Toffoli gates\u2014an
      unfeasible number of Toffoli gates to perform.</p></blockquote><p>(A Toffoli

      href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34\\\">A recent review</a>
      agrees with this assessment: the authors write that \u201Cthere is currently
      no evidence that heuristic NISQ approaches [like VQE] will be able to scale
      to large system sizes and provide advantage over classical methods,\u201D and
      conclude with this paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>Solving the electronic structure
      problem has repeatedly been identified as one of the most promising applications
      for quantum computers. Nevertheless, the discussion above highlights a number
      of challenges for current quantum approaches to become practical. Most notably,
      after accounting for the approximations typically made (i.e. incorporating the
      cost of initial state preparation, using nonminimal basis sets, including repetitions
      for correctness checking and sampling a range of parameters), a large number
      of logical qubits and total T/Toffoli gates are required. A major difficulty
      is that, unlike problems such as factoring, the end-to-end electronic structure
      problem typically requires solving a large number of closely related problem
      instances.</p></blockquote><p>An important thing to note, which the above paragraph
      alludes to, is that the specific quantum algorithms discussed here don't actually
      make quantum chemistry faster than today\u2019s methods\u2014they typically
      rely on a Hartree\u2013Fock ansatz, which is about the same amount of work as
      a DFT calculation. Since it's likely that proper treatment of electron correlation
      will require a sizable basis set, much like we see with coupled-cluster theory,
      we can presume that quantum methods would be slower than most DFT methods (even
      assuming that the actual quantum part of the calculation could be run instantly).</p><p>This
      ignores the fact that the quantum methods would of course give much better results\u2014but
      an uncomfortable truth is that, unlike one might think from the exuberant press
      releases quoted above, classical algorithms generally do an exceptional job
      already. Most molecules are very simple from an electronic structure perspective:
      static electron correlation is pretty rare, and linear scaling CCSD(T) approaches
      are widely available and very effective (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00359\\\">e.g.</a>).
      There\u2019s simply no need for FCI-quality results for most chemical problems,
      <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08927.pdf\\\">random exceptions notwithstanding</a>.</p><p>(Aspuru-Guzik
      and co-workers agree; <a href=\\\"https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003\\\">in
      a 2020 review</a>, they state that they \u201Cdo not expect [HF and DFT] calculations
      to be replaced by those on quantum computers, given the large system sizes that
      are simulated,\u201D suggesting instead that quantum computers might find utility
      for statically correlated systems with 100+ spin orbitals)</p><p>A related point
      I made in a <a href=\\\"https://rowansci.substack.com/p/quantum-chemistry-in-drug-discovery\\\">recent
      essay/white paper for Rowan</a> is that quantum chemistry, at least as it\u2019s
      applied to drug discovery, is limited not by accuracy but by speed. Existing
      quantum chemistry methods are already far more accurate than state-of-the-art
      drug discovery methods; replacing them with quantum computing-based approaches
      is like worrying about whether to bring a Lamborghini or a Formula 1 car to
      a go-kart race. It\u2019s almost certain that there\u2019s some way that \u201Cperfect\u201D
      electronic structure calculations could be useful in drug design, but it\u2019s
      hardly trivial to figure out how to turn a bunch of VQE calculations into a
      clinical candidate.</p><p>Other fields, like materials science, seem to be more
      limited by inaccuracies in theory\u2014modeling metals and surfaces is really
      hard\u2014but the Hartree\u2013Fock ansatz is also hard here, and there are
      fewer commercial precedents for computational chemistry in general. To my knowledge,
      the Hartree\u2013Fock starting point alone is a terrific challenge for a system
      like e.g. a cube of 10,000 metal atoms, which is why so many materials scientists
      avoid exact exchange and stick to local functionals. (I don't know much about
      computations on periodic systems, though, so correct me if this is wrong!) Using
      quantum computing to design superconducting materials probably won\u2019t be
      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1684831855411961857\\\">as
      easy as it seems on Twitter/X</a>.</p><p>So, while quantum computing is a terrifically
      exciting direction for computational chemistry in a scientific sense, I\u2019m
      not sure it\u2019s yet investable in a business sense. I don\u2019t mean to
      belittle all the great scientific work being done in this field, in the papers
      I\u2019ve referenced above and in many others. The point I\u2019m trying to
      make here\u2014that this field isn\u2019t mature enough for actual commercial
      utility\u2014could just as easily be made about ML in the 2000s, or any other
      number of promising but pre-commercial technologies.</p><p>I\u2019ll close by
      noting that it seems like markets are coming around to this perspective, too.

      would be nice too.</p></blockquote><p>This is still hard! To my knowledge, no
      progress has really been made towards this goal in a general sense (although
      plenty of isolated fluorination reactions are still reported, many of which
      are useful).</p><p>C\u2013H fluorination is particularly challenging because
      separating C\u2013H and C\u2013F compounds can be quite difficult. (Fluorine
      is often considered a hydrogen bioisostere, which is nice from a design perspective
      but annoying from a <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac403376h\\\">chromatography</a>
      perspective.) For this reason, I\u2019m more optimistic about methods that go
      through separable intermediates than the article\u2019s author: \u201Cinstalling
      another reactive group\u2026 and exchanging it for fluorine\u201D may not be
      particularly ideal in the Baran sense, but my guess is that this strategy will
      be more fruitful than direct C\u2013H fluorination for a long while yet.</p><h3><strong>Heteroatom
      Alkylation</strong></h3><blockquote><p>2. Heteroatom alkylation \u2013 A reaction
      that \u2013 selectively \u2013 attaches an alkyl group onto one heteroatom in
      rings that have several, such as pyrazoles, triazoles and pyridones.</p></blockquote><p>This
      problem is still unsolved. Lloyd-Jones published some nice work on <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b02786\\\">triazole
      alkylation</a> a few weeks after the ChemistryWorld article came out, but otherwise
      it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a problem that people in academia are thinking
      much about.</p><p>Unlike some of the others, this challenge seems ideally suited
      to organocatalysis, so maybe someone else in that subfield will start working
      on it. (Our work on <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04958-w\\\">site-selective
      glycosylation</a> might be relevant?)</p><p><strong>EDIT: I missed <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202014239\\\">extremely
      relevant work</a> from Stephan Hammer, which uses engineered enzymes to alkylate
      pyrazoles with haloalkanes (and cites the ChemistryWorld article directly).
      Sorry!</strong></p><h3><strong>Csp<sup>3</sup> Coupling</strong></h3><blockquote><p>3.
      Carbon coupling \u2013 A reaction as robust and versatile as traditional cross
      coupling for stitching together aliphatic carbon atoms \u2013 ideally with control
      of chirality, too. Chemists also want more options for the kinds of molecules
      they can use as coupling precursors.</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s been a
      ton of work on Csp<sup>3</sup> cross coupling since this article came out: MacMillan

      published a lot of papers, and plenty of other labs are also working here (I
      can\u2019t list everyone, but I\u2019ll highlight <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abo0039?af=R\\\">this
      work</a> from Sevov). I doubt this can be considered \u201Csolved\u201D yet,
      but certainly things are much closer than they were in 2019.</p><p>(I haven\u2019t
      seen much work on enantioselective variants, though: <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13211\\\">this
      2016 paper</a> and paper #2 from Baran above are the only ones that comes to
      mind, although I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing something. Still\u2014an opportunity!)</p><h3><strong>Reactions
      of Heterocycles</strong></h3><blockquote><p>4. Making and modifying heterocycles
      \u2013 A reaction to install functional groups \u2013 from alkyl to halogen
      \u2013 anywhere on aromatic and aliphatic heterocycles, such as pyridine, piperidine
      or isoxazole. Reactions that can make completely new heterocycles from scratch
      would be a bonus.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not a big fan of the way this
      goal is written\u2014virtually every structure in medicinal chemistry has a
      heterocycle, so \u201Cmaking and modifying heterocycles\u201D is just too vague.
      What would a general solution even look like?</p><p>Nevertheless, there are
      plenty of recent papers which address this sort of problem. Some of my favorites
      are:</p><ul><li><p>Aaron Sather\u2019s work making <em>N</em>-aryl piperidines
      (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b13114\\\">1</a>, <a
      href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62853937f053df9a6d208577\\\">2</a>)</p></li><li><p>Basically
      <a href=\\\"https://www.mcnallygroup.org/publications-2\\\">all of Andy McNally\u2019s
      work</a></p></li><li><p>Some nice <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c03537\\\">reagent
      design</a> from Patrick Fier, which basically improves on the Chichibabin reaction</p></li></ul><p>(One
      of my friends in academia told me that they really disliked the Sather work
      because it was just classic reactivity used in a straightforward way, i.e. not
      daring enough. What a clear illustration of misaligned incentives!)</p><h3><strong>Atom
      Swapping/Skeletal Editing</strong></h3><blockquote><p>5. Atom swapping \u2013
      A reaction that can exchange individual atoms selectively, like swapping a carbon
      for a nitrogen atom in a ring. This chemical version of gene editing could revolutionise
      drug discovery, but is probably furthest from realisation.</p></blockquote><p>Ironically,
      this goal is probably the one that\u2019s closest to realization today (or perhaps
      #3): <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08464\\\">Noah Burns</a>
      and <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adj5331\\\">Mark
      Levin</a> have both published papers converting benzene rings directly to pyridines
      recently. More broadly, lots of organic chemists are getting interested in \u201Cskeletal
      editing\u201D (i.e. modifying the skeleton of a molecule, not the periphery),
      which seems like exactly what this goal is describing. To my knowledge, a comprehensive
      review has not yet been published, but <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01735-1#ref-CR2\\\">this
      article</a> gives a pretty good overview of the area.</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s
      impressive how much progress has been made towards the goals enumerated in the
      original article, given that it\u2019s only been four years (less than the average
      length of a PhD!). Organic methodology is a very exciting field right now: data
      is easy to acquire, there are lots of problems to work on, and there seems to
      be genuine interest from adjacent fields about the technologies being developed.
      Still, if the toughest challenges in the field\u2019s imagination can be solved
      in under a decade, it makes you wonder what organic methodology will look like
      in 20\u201330 years.</p><p>As methods get faster to develop and more and more
      methods are published, what will happen? Will chemists employ an exponentially
      growing arsenal of transformations in their syntheses, or will the same methods
      continually be forgotten and rediscovered every few decades? Will computers
      be able to sift through centuries of literature and build the perfect synthesis\u2014or
      will the rise of automation mean that we have to redesign every reaction to
      be \u201Cdump and stir\u201D? Or will biocatalysis just render this entire field
      obsolete? The exact nature of synthesis\u2019s eschatology remains to be determined.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"In

      guides</a>)</em></p><p>Scientists, engineers, and other technical people often
      make fun of networking. Until a few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking
      was some dumb activity done by business students who didn\u2019t have actual
      work to do, or something exploitative focused on pure self-advancement. But
      over the past year or so, I\u2019ve learned why networking is important, and
      have found a way to network that doesn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable or
      selfish. I want to share my current thoughts here, in case they help anyone
      else.</p><p>The first thing to recognize is that networking matters because
      we live in a world of relationships. Technical people often struggle with this
      point: to some, relying on relationships feels imprecise or even nepotistic.
      But we\u2019re human beings, not stateless automata communicating via some protocol,
      and it\u2019s inevitable (and appropriate) for us to form relationships and
      care about them.</p><p>Having the right relationships can make a big difference.
      We trust people we know much more than we trust strangers. It\u2019s weird for
      someone whom you\u2019ve never met to email you asking for a favor, but very
      normal for a friend or acquaintance to reach out and ask for something. And
      most ambitious projects (academia, startups, etc) are limited not by money but
      by human capital: there are only so many talented people out there, and if you
      can\u2019t get access to them, what you\u2019re doing will suffer. (On a macro
      level, this explains why management consulting has become so important.)</p><p>So
      it\u2019s worth intentionally building relationships before you have an immediate
      need. There are a lot of people,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> so how might one
      go about this? One obvious strategy might be to build relationships with people
      you think could be useful to you. But this doesn\u2019t work very well. It\u2019s
      not always obvious what will or won\u2019t be useful in the future, and far
      too easy to let status quo bias reign supreme. (Most graduate students struggle
      to imagine how knowing someone from another subfield could ever be useful, let
      alone someone who isn\u2019t a scientist, which makes it tough when they want
      to do <a href=\\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24459155\\\">something
      outside academia.</a>)</p><p>Another downside to this strategy is that you have
      to partition people into \u201Cuseful\u201D or \u201Cnot useful\u201D upon meeting
      them. This is self-defeating: most people can figure out when you\u2019re treating
      them only as a means to an end, so walking around evaluating everyone\u2019s
      utility tends to poison your interactions. Plus, it\u2019s a very Machiavellian
      way to view the world, and ought to make you feel a little gross.</p><p>Instead,
      a better strategy is to accept that you won\u2019t be able to predict <em>a
      priori</em> who will be useful and instead just try and meet people. If the
      end goal of networking is to find people you\u2019ll be able to collaborate
      with in the future, in one capacity or another, then it\u2019s important to
      find people who share your values and who you get along with: in other words,
      friends. So, rather than worrying about if it\u2019ll be better to know a renewable
      energy consultant or a paralegal for a medical device company, you can just
      see who you like spending time with and go from there.</p><p>If we think of
      networking as synonymous to making friends, then it also becomes more obvious
      when and how one should network. Anything explicitly framed as an opportunity
      for networking is a bad choice: these events tend to attract people who are
      self-centered, and mostly end up revolving around LinkedIn (the Tinder of networking?).
      Instead, look for places where you\u2019ll find people you could be friends
      with. For me, this ends up mostly being church and church-adjacent spaces like
      Bible studies; I\u2019m not sure what the analogous space for non-religious
      people is.</p><p>The strategies I\u2019ve discussed above are framed in terms
      of \u201Cdemand-side networking,\u201D or how you can find ways to acquire human
      capital when you have a demand for it. But the same considerations apply to
      \u201Csupply-side networking,\u201D or marketing oneself to potential people.
      The beauty of treating networking simply as making friends is that you\u2019re
      not committing to any particular outcome: maybe you\u2019ll benefit from it,
      maybe the other person will benefit from it, or maybe both of you will (or neither).
      The expected value of building new relationships should always be positive,
      which means that networking isn\u2019t a zero-sum game: it\u2019s good for all
      involved.</p><p>The conclusion I want to leave you with is this: networking,
      rightly understood, just means living in a way that recognizes our dependence
      on other people. To live life as a \u201Cnetworker\u201D means putting yourself
      in places where you might make new friends, looking for common ground in all
      your interactions, and trying to recognize others\u2019 talents and abilities.
      Networking isn\u2019t some Randian pursuit focused on extracting value from
      those around us. It should be done with humility, accepting that we need other
      people to thrive and being open to whatever relationships come our way.</p><p><em>Thanks

      this figure, the top left corner is the goal\u2014perfect accuracy in no time
      at all\u2014and the bottom right corner is the opposite. The diagonal line represents
      the Pareto frontier, and we can see that different levels of theory put you
      at different places along the frontier. <em>Ab initio</em> methods (DFT, MP2,
      coupled cluster) are slow but accurate, while force fields are fast but inaccurate,
      and semiempirical methods and ML methods are somewhere in the middle. (It\u2019s
      interesting to observe that some ML methods are quite far from the optimal frontier,
      but I suppose that\u2019s only to be expected from such a new field.)</p><p>An
      important takeaway from this graph is that some regions of the Pareto frontier
      are easier to access than others. Within e.g. DFT, it\u2019s relatively facile
      to tune the accuracy of the method employed, but it\u2019s much harder to find
      a method intermediate between DFT and semiempirical methods. (For a variety
      of reasons that I\u2019ll write about later, this region of the frontier seems
      particularly interesting to me, so it\u2019s not just an intellectual question.)
      This lacuna is what Stefan Grimme\u2019s \u201Ccomposite\u201D methods, the
      subject of today\u2019s post, are trying to address.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      defines a composite method? The term hasn\u2019t been precisely defined in the
      literature (as far as I\u2019m aware), but the basic idea is to strip down existing
      <em>ab initio</em> electronic structure methods as much as possible, particularly
      the basis sets, and employ a few additional corrections to fix whatever inaccuracies
      this introduces. Thus, composite methods still have the essential form of DFT
      or Hartree\u2013Fock, but rely heavily on cancellation of error to give them
      better accuracy than one might expect. (This is in contrast to semiempirical
      methods like <em>xtb</em>, which start with a more approximate level of theory
      and layer on a ton of corrections.)</p><p>Grimme and coworkers are quick to
      acknowledge that their ideas aren\u2019t entirely original. To quote from their
      first composite paper (on HF-3c):</p><blockquote><p>Several years ago Pople
      noted that HF/STO-3G optimized geometries for small molecules are excellent,
      better than HF is inherently capable of yielding. Similar observations were
      made by Ko\u0142os already in 1979, who obtained good interaction energies for
      a HF/minimal-basis method together with a counterpoise-correction as well as
      a correction to account for the London dispersion energy. It seems that part
      of this valuable knowledge has been forgotten during the recent \u201Ctriumphal
      procession\u201D of DFT in chemistry. The true consequences of these intriguing
      observations could not be explored fully at that time due to missing computational
      resources but are the main topic of this work.</p></blockquote><p>And it\u2019s
      not as though minimal basis sets have been forgotten: <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01127507\\\">MIDIX</a>
      still sees use (I used it during my PhD), and Todd Martinez has been exploring
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp307741u\\\">these ideas</a> for
      a while. Nevertheless, composite methods seem to have attracted attention in
      a way that the above work hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ll discuss why this might be at
      the end of the post\u2014but first, let\u2019s discuss what the composite methods
      actually are.</p><h2><strong>HF-3c (2013)</strong></h2><p><a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.23317\\\">HF-3c</a>
      is a lightweight Hartree\u2013Fock method, using a minimal basis set derived
      from Huzinaga\u2019s MINIS basis set. To ameliorate the issues that Hartree\u2013Fock
      and a tiny basis set cause, the authors layer in three corrections: the D3 dispersion
      correction (with Becke\u2013Johnson damping), their recent <a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/136/15/154101/941628/A-geometrical-correction-for-the-inter-and-intra?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">\u201CgCP\u201D</a>
      geometric counterpoise correction for basis set incompleteness error, and an
      \u201CSRB\u201D short-range basis correction for electronegative elements.</p><p>HF-3c
      is surprisingly good at geometry optimization and noncovalent interaction energies
      (MAE of 0.39 kcal/mol on the S66 benchmark set), works okay for <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10144\\\">dipole
      moments</a> and vibrational frequencies, but seems bad for anything involving
      bond breaking. Thus the authors recommend it for optimization of ground-state
      complexes, and not so much for finding an entire potential energy surface.</p><div

      complaint about all of these papers: the basis set optimization isn\u2019t described
      in much detail, and we basically have to take the authors\u2019 word that what
      they came up with is actually the best.)</p><h2><strong>HF-3c(v) (2014)</strong></h2><p><a
      href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz5021313\\\">HF-3c(v)</a> is pretty
      much the same as HF-3c, but it uses a \u201Clarge-core\u201D effective core
      potential to describe all of the core electrons, making it valence-only. This
      makes it 2\u20134 times faster, but also seems to make it much worse than HF-3c:
      I\u2019m not sure the speed is worth the loss in accuracy.</p><p>The authors
      only use it to explore noncovalent interactions; I\u2019m not sure if others
      have used it since.</p><h2><strong>PBEh-3c (2015)</strong></h2><p><a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/143/5/054107/194086/Consistent-structures-and-interactions-by-density?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">PBEh-3c</a>
      is the next \u201C3c\u201D method, and the first composite DFT method. As opposed
      to the minimal basis set employed in HF-3c, Grimme et al here elect to use a
      polarized double-zeta basis set, which \u201Csignificantly improves the energetic
      description without sacrificing the computational efficiency too much.\u201D
      They settle on a variant of def2-SV(P) with an effective core potential and
      a few other modifications, which they call \u201Cdef-mSVP.\u201D</p><p>As before,
      they also add the D3 and gCP corrections (both slightly modified), but they
      leave out the SRB correction. The biggest change is that they also reparameterize
      the PBE functional, which introduces an additional four parameters: three in
      PBE, and one to tune the percentage of Fock exchange. The authors note that
      increasing the Fock exchange from 25% to 42% offsets the error introduced by
      basis set incompleteness.</p><p>As before, the focus of the evaluation is on
      geometry optimization, and PBEh-3c seems to do very well (although not better
      than HF-3c on e.g. S66, which is surprising\u2014the authors also don\u2019t
      compare directly to HF-3c in the paper at all). PBEh-3c also does pretty well
      on the broad GMTKN30 database, which includes thermochemistry and barrier heights,
      faring just a bit worse than M06-2x/def2-SV(P).</p><h2><strong>HSE-3c (2016)</strong></h2><p><a
      href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/CP/C6CP01697A\\\">HSE-3c</a>
      is basically the same as PBEh-3c, but now using a screened exchange variant
      to make it more robust and faster for large systems or systems with small band
      gaps. The authors recommend using PBEh-3c for small molecules or large band-gap
      systems, which is my focus here, so I won\u2019t discuss HSE-3c further.</p><h2><strong>B97-3c
      (2018)</strong></h2><p><a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/148/6/064104/196461/B97-3c-A-revised-low-cost-variant-of-the-B97-D?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">B97-3c</a>
      is another DFT composite method, but it\u2019s a bit different than PBEh-3c.
      PBE is a pretty simple functional with only three tunable parameters, while
      B97 is significantly more complex with ten tunable parameters. Crucially, B97
      is a pure functional, meaning that no Fock exchange is involved, which comes
      with benefits and tradeoffs. The authors write:</p><blockquote><p>The main aim
      here is to complete our hierarchy of \u201C3c\u201D methods by approaching the
      accuracy of large basis set DFT with a physically sound and numerically well-behaved
      approach.</p></blockquote><p>For a basis set, the authors use a modified form
      of def2-TZVP called \u201CmTZVP\u201D, arguing that \u201Cas the basis set is
      increased to triple-\u03B6 quality, we can profit from a more flexible exchange
      correlation functional.\u201D This time, the D3 and SRB corrections are employed,
      but the gCP correction is omitted.</p><p>The authors do a bunch of benchmarking:
      in general, B97-3c seems to be substantially better than either PBEh-3c or HF-3c
      at every task, which isn\u2019t surprising given the larger basis set. B97-3c
      is also often better than e.g. B3LYP-D3 with a quadruple-zeta basis set, meaning
      that it can probably be used as a drop-in replacement for most routine tasks.</p><div

      href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00877\\\">B3LYP-3c</a>
      is a variant of PBEh-3c where you just remove the PBEh functional and replace
      it with B3LYP (without reparameterizing B3LYP at all). This is done to improve
      the accuracy for vibrational frequencies, since B3LYP performs quite well for
      frequencies. I\u2019ve only seen this in one paper, so I\u2019m not sure this
      will catch on (although it does seem to work).</p><h2><strong>r<sup>2</sup>
      SCAN-3c (2021)</strong></h2><p>Continuing our journey through the \u201CJacob\u2019s
      ladder\u201D of composite functionals, we arrive at <a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/154/6/064103/199831/r2SCAN-3c-A-Swiss-army-knife-composite-electronic?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">r<sup>2</sup>
      SCAN-3c</a>, based on the meta-GGA r<sup>2</sup> SCAN functional. No reparameterization
      of the base functional is performed, but the D4 and gCP corrections are added,
      and yet another basis set is developed: mTZVPP, a variant of the mTZVP basis
      set developed for B97-3c, which was already a variant of def2-TZVP.</p><p>The
      authors describe the performance of r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c in rather breathless
      terms:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026we argue that r<sup>2</sup> SCAN is the first
      mGGA functional that truly climbs up to the third rung of the Jacobs ladder
      without significant side effects (e.g., numerical instabilities or an overfitting
      behavior that leads to a bad performance for the mindless benchmark set).<br><br>\u2026the
      new and thoroughly tested composite method r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c provides benchmark-accuracy
      for key properties at a fraction of the cost of previously required hybrid/QZ
      approaches and is more robust than any other method of comparable cost. This
      drastically shifts the aforementioned balance between the computational efficiency
      and accuracy, enabling much larger and/or more thorough screenings and property
      calculations. In fact, the robustness and broad applicability of r<sup>2</sup>
      SCAN-3c caused us to rethink the very structure of screening approaches.</p></blockquote><p>The
      amount of benchmarking performed is a little overwhelming. Here\u2019s a nice
      figure that summarizes r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c on the GMTKN55 database, and also
      compares it to B97-3c:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      (2022)</strong></h2><p>Finally, we come to <a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/158/1/014103/2867476/B97X-3c-A-composite-range-separated-hybrid-DFT?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">\u03C9B97X-3c</a>,
      a composite range-separated hybrid functional derived from Mardirossian and

      functional (which seems to me to be one of the best DFT methods, period). \u03C9B97X-3c
      reintroduces Fock exchange, so it\u2019s significantly more expensive than r<sup>2</sup>
      SCAN-3c or B97-3c, but with this expense comes increased accuracy.</p><p>Interestingly,
      neither of the \u201Cweird\u201D corrections (gCP or SRB) are employed for \u03C9B97X-3c:
      it\u2019s just an off-the-shelf unmodified functional, the now-standard D4 dispersion
      correction, and a specialized basis set. The authors acknowledge this:</p><blockquote><p>Although
      \u03C9B97X-3c is designed mostly in the spirit of the other \u201C3c\u201D methods,
      the meaning and definition of the applied \u201Cthree corrections\u201D have
      changed over the years. As before, the acronym stands for the dispersion correction
      and for the specially developed AO basis set, but here for the compilation of
      ECPs, which are essential for efficiency, as a third modification.</p></blockquote><p>(But
      weren\u2019t there ECPs before? Doesn\u2019t even HF-3c have ECPs? Aren\u2019t
      ECPs just part of the basis set? Just admit that this is a \u201C2c\u201D method,
      folks.)</p><p>The authors devote a lot of effort to basis-set optimization,
      because range-separated hybrids are so expensive that using a triple-zeta basis
      set like they did for B97-3c or r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c would ruin the speed of
      the method. This time, they do go into more details, and emphasize that the
      basis set (\u201CvDZP\u201D) was optimized on molecules and not just on single
      atoms:</p><blockquote><p>Molecule-optimized basis sets are rarely used in quantum
      chemistry. We are aware of the MOLOPT sets in the CP2K code and the polarization
      consistent (pc-n) basis sets by Jensen. In the latter, only the polarization
      functions are optimized with respect to molecular energies. A significant advantage
      of molecular basis set optimizations is that, contrary to atomic optimizations,
      all angular momentum functions (i.e., polarization functions not occupied in
      the atomic ground state) can be determined consistently, as already noted by
      VandeVondele and Hutter.</p></blockquote><p>They also put together a new set
      of effective core potentials, which also helps to minimize the number of basis
      functions. Even so, \u03C9B97X-3c is by far the slowest of the composite methods,
      as shown in this figure:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      interesting observation is that \u03C9B97X-3c is not just Pareto-optimal, but
      close to optimal in an absolute sense. I initially framed the goal of composite
      methods as finding new ways to increase speed while decreasing accuracy: but
      here it seems that we can gain a ton of speed without losing much accuracy at
      all! This should be somewhat surprising, and the implications will be discussed
      later.</p><h2><strong>Overall Summary</strong></h2><p>Excluding some of the
      more specific composite methods, there seem to be three tiers here:</p><ol><li><p>HF-3c,
      which is very fast but only reliable for geometry optimizations and pretty easy
      property calculations (e.g. dipole moment, rough frequencies). But also, geometry
      optimizations are ubiquitous, so this is still very important.</p></li><li><p>PBEh-3c,
      B97-3c, and r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c, which are all roughly the same speed despite
      substantial differences. Of these, PBEh-3c seems like the slowest and least
      accurate, and I\u2019d be tempted to use either of the others first, especially
      r<sup>2</sup> SCAN-3c. (I\u2019m curious about the tradeoffs that a mGGA functional
      has versus a GGA functional like B97-3c\u2014are there pathological integration
      grid behaviors that B97-3c avoids? See Figure 6 <a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/157/17/174114/2842017/Many-recent-density-functionals-are-numerically\\\">here</a>.)</p></li><li><p>\u03C9B97X-3c,
      which seems to be in a class of its own, and better than almost everything else
      (not just other composites). That being said, it\u2019s still new, and no one
      loves a method better than its own authors. We\u2019ll have to see some real-world
      tests to make sure things are as promising as they seem.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2><p>After
      decades of theorists mocking people for using small basis sets, it\u2019s ironic
      that intentionally embracing cancellation of error is trendy again. I\u2019m
      glad to see actual theorists turn their attention to this problem: people have
      never stopped using \u201Cinadequate\u201D basis sets like 6-31G(d), simply
      because nothing larger is practical for many systems of interest!</p><p>The
      results from this body of work suggest that current basis sets are far from
      optimal, too. The only piece of \u03C9B97X-3c that\u2019s new is the basis set,
      and yet that seems to make a huge difference relative to state-of-the-art. What
      happens if vDZP is used for other methods, like B97? The authors suggest that
      it might be generally effective, but more work is needed to study this further.</p><p>Basis-set
      optimization seems like a <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html\\\">\u201Cschlep\u201D</a>
      that people have avoided because of how annoying it is, or something which is
      practically useful but not very scientifically interesting or publishable. Perhaps
      the success of composite methods will push more people towards studying basis
      sets; I think that would be a good outcome of this research. It seems unlikely
      to me that vDZP cannot be optimized further; if the results above are any indication,
      the Pareto frontier of basis sets can be advanced much more.</p><p>I\u2019m
      also curious if Grimme and friends would change HF-3c and the other early methods,
      knowing what they know now. Do better basis sets alleviate the need for gCP
      and SRB, or is that not possible with a minimal basis set? What about D3 versus
      D4 (which wasn\u2019t available at the time)? Hopefully someone finds the time
      to go back and do this, because to my knowledge HF-3c sees a good amount of
      use.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite part of this work, though, is the ways in which
      composite methods reduce the degrees of freedom available to end users. \u201CClassic\u201D
      DFT has a ton of tunable parameters (functional, basis set, corrections, solvent
      models, thresholds, and so forth), and people frequently make inefficient or
      nonsensical choices when faced with this complexity. In contrast, composite
      methods make principled and opinionated choices for many of these variables,
      thus giving scientists a well-defined menu of options.</p><p>This also makes
      it easier for outsiders to understand what\u2019s going on. I wrote about this
      <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html\\\">over
      a year ago</a>:</p><blockquote><p>While a seasoned expert can quickly assess
      the relative merits of BYLP/MIDI! and DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVP, to the layperson
      it\u2019s tough to guess which might be superior\u2026 The manifold diversity
      of parameters employed today is a sign of [computational chemistry]\u2019s immaturity\u2014in
      truly mature fields, there\u2019s an accepted right way to do things.</p></blockquote><p>The
      simplicity of composite methods cuts down on the amount of things that you have
      to memorize in order to understand computational chemistry. You only have to
      remember \u201CHF-3c is fast and sloppy,\u201D rather than trying to recall
      how many basis functions pcseg-1 has or which Minnesota functional is good for
      main-group geometries.</p><p>So, I\u2019m really optimistic about this whole
      area of research, and I\u2019m excited that other labs are now working on similar
      things (I didn\u2019t have space to cover everyone\u2019s contributions, but

      analysis,\u201D is a family of techniques used to dissect interactions in a
      system with multiple molecules. In this case, an EDA calculation on the <strong>AB</strong>
      system would break down the interaction between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>

      are inherently not localized to individual fragments of a multimolecular system\u2014you
      can\u2019t just slice apart the molecular orbitals or the density matrix and
      end up with anything that\u2019s physically sane. So you have to do some computational
      gymnastics to get energetic terms which are at all meaningful. Many such gymnastic
      workflows have been proposed, leading to a veritable alphabet soup of different
      EDA methods.</p><p>(It\u2019s worth skimming <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.26003\\\">this

      ground-state fragments <strong>A</strong><sup>0</sup> and <strong>B</strong><sup>0</sup>
      are distorted to the geometries and electronic states (<strong>A</strong> &amp;
      <strong>B</strong>) which they possess in <strong>AB</strong>, and the energy
      required for this distortion/excitation is termed <em>E</em><sub>prep</sub>.
      (The difference between <em>E</em>(<strong>AB</strong>) and <em>E</em>(<strong>A</strong>)
      + <em>E</em>(<strong>B</strong>) is called <em>E</em><sub>int</sub>, and the
      total binding energy is equal to <em>E</em><sub>int</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>prep</sub>.)</p></li><li><p>The
      distorted fragments <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are brought together
      (with frozen charge densities) to form the \u201Cpromolecule\u201D <strong>AB</strong><sup>0</sup>,
      and the change in energy is termed <em>E</em><sub>elstat</sub>, the quasiclassical
      Coulomb interaction energy (typically attractive). The wavefunction for <strong>AB</strong><sup>0</sup>
      is \u03A8<sup>A</sup>\u03A8<sup>B</sup>.</p></li><li><p>The product wavefunction
      \u03A8<sup>A</sup>\u03A8<sup>B</sup> is antisymmetrized and renormalized to
      give an \u201Cintermediate state\u201D \u03A8<sup>0</sup> with energy <em>E</em><sup>0</sup>,
      and the change in energy is termed <em>E</em><sub>Pauli</sub>, originating from
      Pauli repulsion. This component is always repulsive.</p></li><li><p>\u03A8<sup>0</sup>
      is relaxed to yield the final wavefunction \u03A8<sup>AB</sup>. The change in

      and is always attractive.</p></li></ol><p>Thus, <em>E</em><sub>int</sub> = <em>E</em><sub>elstat</sub>
      + <em>E</em><sub>Pauli</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>orb</sub>. (Dispersion can also
      be added if an exogenous dispersion correction is employed\u2014that\u2019s
      pretty trivial.)</p><p>The critical reader might observe that the steps taken
      to obtain these numbers are pretty odd, and that the components of the interaction
      energy arise from differences in energy between bizarre nonphysical states.
      Thus, the interpretation of terms like <em>E</em><sub>elstat</sub> in terms
      of actual physical interactions might not be as easy as it seems. The authors
      of the above review agree:</p><blockquote><p>It is important to realize that
      the identification of the three major terms \u0394<em>E</em><sub>elstat</sub>,
      \u0394<em>E</em><sub>Pauli</sub>, and \u0394<em>E</em><sub>orb</sub> with specific
      interactions is conceptually attractive but must not be taken as genuine expression
      of the physical forces.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, it seems that imprecise
      concepts familiar to experimental chemists like \u201Csteric repulsion\u201D
      and \u201Celectrostatic attraction\u201D have to be discarded in favor of precise
      terms like <em>E</em><sub>Pauli</sub>. Too bad they\u2019re virtually uninterpretable!</p><p>And
      what\u2019s worse is that different EDA-type schemes don\u2019t even give the
      same results. <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c08196\\\">A
      paper</a> out today in <em>JACS</em> from Zare/Shaik discusses the use of EDA
      and related schemes in studying the origin of the hydrogen bond (a pretty fundamental
      question), motivated by the substantial disagreement between various techniques:</p><blockquote><p>It
      is important to realize that different methods (e.g., BOVB, ALMO-EDA, NEDA,
      and BLW) do not fully agree with one another about whether the dominant stabilizing
      term is \u0394<em>E</em><sub>POL</sub> or \u0394<em>E</em><sub>CT</sub> in a
      particular HB.</p></blockquote><p>While the authors make a good case that the
      sum of these two terms is relatively conserved across methods, and that it\u2019s
      this term that we should care about for hydrogen bonds, the conclusions for
      EDA broadly are not encouraging. (Note, too, that <em>E</em><sub>POL</sub> and
      <em>E</em><sub>CT</sub> don\u2019t even appear in the EDA-NCOV method summarized
      above\u2014another reason that EDA is a frustrating field!)</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      if the theorists eventually put their heads together and develop a version of
      EDA that doesn\u2019t have these pitfalls, it\u2019s still not clear that any
      form of EDA will give the answers that experimental chemists are looking for.
      Chemistry is complicated, and ground- or transition-state structures arise from
      a delicate equilibrium between opposing factors: steric repulsion, electrostatic
      attraction, bond distances, torsional strain, dispersion, &amp;c.</p><p>As a
      result, one can see large changes in the contribution of individual factors
      even while the overall structure\u2019s stability is minimally perturbed (<a
      href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/md/c4md00057a\\\">enthalpy\u2013entropy
      compensation</a> is a classic example, as is Fig. 2 in <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201701486\\\">this
      review</a> on distortion\u2013interaction analysis). Looking only at changes
      in individual factors isn\u2019t always a useful way to gain insight from computation.</p><p>For
      example, imagine a nucleophile adding to two faces of an oxocarbenium, a bulky
      face and an unhindered face. Based on this description, we might expect to see
      that TS<sub>bulky</sub> has higher steric repulsion than TS<sub>unhindered</sub>
      (if we\u2019re lucky enough to find a way to extract <em>E</em><sub>steric</sub>
      out of our EDA method). But it\u2019s also likely that the nucleophile might
      take a less favorable trajectory towards the oxocarbenium in TS<sub>bulky</sub>
      to avoid steric repulsion, thus weakening key orbital interactions. These changes
      might even end up being larger in magnitude than the destabilization induced
      by steric repulsion. Is the correct answer, then, that TS<sub>bulky</sub> is
      higher in energy because of decreased <em>E</em><sub>orb</sub>, not increased
      <em>E</em><sub>steric</sub>?</p><p>The solution is to recognize that causation
      is not unique (cf. <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes\\\">Aristotle</a>),
      and so there\u2019s no one right answer here. Within the constraints of the
      EDA framework, the theorist wouldn\u2019t be incorrect in saying that <em>E</em><sub>orb</sub>
      is the driving factor\u2014but the experimental chemist might reasonably expect
      \u201Cthe bulky TS is destabilized by steric repulsion\u201D as their answer,
      since this is the root cause of the changes between the two structures. (I side
      with the experimentalists here.)</p><p>And the precisely defined concepts favored
      by theorists are often hard for experimental scientists to work with. Even if
      the correct answer in the above scenario were \u201C<em>TS</em><sub>bulky</sub>
      is destabilized by decreased orbital overlap\u201D\u2014what\u2019s an experimentalist
      supposed to do with this information, add more orbitals? (This is how I feel
      about Trevor Hamlin\u2019s work on Pauli repulsion.) The steric explanation
      at least suggests an intuitive solution (make the bulky group or the nucleophile
      smaller). If the purpose of EDA is to help people to understand intermolecular
      interactions better on a conceptual level, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s succeeding
      in most cases.</p><p>(The only use of EDA that led to an actual experimental
      advance which I\u2019m aware of is Buchwald/Peng Liu\u2019s body of work on
      ligand\u2013substrate dispersion in hydrocupration: <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07373\\\">study</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b09565\\\">new ligand</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c08746\\\">ligand from Hartwig</a>.
      I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that these papers focus on dispersion,
      one of the easiest pieces of EDA to decouple and understand.)</p><p>I don\u2019t
      mean to be too critical here. The ability to break intermolecular interactions
      down into different components is certainly useful, and it seems likely that
      some version of EDA will eventually achieve consensus and emerge as a useful
      tool. But I think the utility of EDA even in the best case is pretty limited.
      Quantum chemistry is complicated, and if we think we can break it down into
      easy-to-digest components and eliminate the full nonlocal majesty of the Schrodinger
      equation, we\u2019re lying to ourselves (or our experimental collaborators).

      pretty intuitive model, and one which is often employed when thinking about
      organocatalysis, particularly noncovalent organocatalysis. (It\u2019s a bit
      harder to use this model when the mechanism changes in a fundamental way, as
      with many organometallic reactions.) Many transition states have distinctive

      called the \u201C<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion_hole\\\">oxyanion

      TS for alcoholysis of amides. The negative charge is unique to the tetrahedral
      intermediate and the high-energy TSs to either side, so reactant/product inhibition
      isn\u2019t a big issue. This motif can be mimicked by dual hydrogen-bond donor
      organocatalysts like the one my PhD lab specialized in.)</p><p>The downside
      of this approach to catalyst design is that each new sort of reaction mechanism
      requires a different sort of catalyst. One TS features increasing negative charge
      at one place, while another features increasing positive charge at another,
      and a third is practically charge-neutral the whole way through. What if there
      were some feature that was common to all transition states?</p><p>A recent <a

      an eye on.) The authors tackle the question of when precisely a stretching bond
      can be considered \u201Cbroken.\u201D An intuitive answer might be \u201Cthe
      transition state,\u201D but as the paper points out, plenty of bond-breaking

      class=\\\"image-caption\\\"><em>Hydrogen PES (red), with various polarizability
      components shown in blue.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Instead, the authors
      propose that polarizability is a good way to study this question. As seen in
      the following graph, polarizability (particularly \u03B1<sub>||</sub>, the component
      parallel to the bond axis) first increases as a bond is stretched, and then
      decreases, with a sharp and easily identifiable maximum about where a bond might
      be considered to be broken. This metric tracks with the conventional PES metric
      in cases where the PES is well-defined (see Fig. 5), which is comforting. Why
      does this occur?</p><blockquote><p>The evolution of \u03B1 [polarizability]
      can be rationalized in the following manner. Upon initially stretching H2 from
      equilibrium, the bonding electrons fill up the additional accessible volume,
      resulting in a more diffuse (and thus more polarizable) electron density. Post
      bond cleavage however, the electrons start localizing on individual atoms, leading
      to a decrease in polarizability.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, electrons
      that are \u201Ccaught in the act\u201D of reorganizing between different atoms
      are more polarizable, whereas electrons which have settled into their new atomic
      residences are less polarizable again.</p><p>This is cool, but how can we apply
      this to catalysis? As it happens, there are already a few publications (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y\\\">1</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y\\\">2</a>) from Dennis
      Dougherty and coworkers dealing with exactly this question. They show that cyclophanes
      are potent catalysts for S<sub>N</sub>2-type reactions that both create and
      destroy cations, and argue that polarizability, rather than any charge-recognition
      effect, undergirds the observed catalysis:</p><blockquote><p>Since transition
      states have long, weak bonds, they are expected to be more polarizable than
      ground-state substrates or products. The role of the host is to surround the
      transition state with an electron-rich-system that is polarizable and in a relatively
      fixed orientation, so that induced dipoles in both the host and the transition
      state are suitably aligned\u2026 Note that in this model, it is not sufficient
      that polarizability contributes to binding. Polarizability must be more important
      for binding transition states than for binding ground states. Only in this way
      can it enhance catalysis.</p></blockquote><p>To defend this argument, the authors
      prepare a series of variously substituted cyclophanes, and show that while Hammett-type
      electronic tuning of the aryl rings has relatively small effects, adding more
      heavy atoms always increases the rate, with the biggest effect observed with
      bromine (the heaviest element attempted). Heavier atoms are more polarizable,
      so this supports the argument that polarizability, rather than any specific
      electrostatic effect, is responsible for catalysis.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      I saw MacMillan\u2019s talk at MIT last year, I was curious what it would take
      to make additional graphics like this. The \u201Cnumber of reactions\u201D plot
      can be made pretty easily from Reaxys, but I\u2019ve always been uncertain how
      the \u201Cnumber of commercial sources\u201D plots are made: I haven\u2019t
      seen references listed for these numbers, nor is anything usually found in the
      Supporting Information.</p><p>I decided to take a swing at getting this data
      myself by analyzing the <a href=\\\"https://mcule.com/database/\\\">Mcule</a>
      \\\"building blocks\\\" database, which contains about 3.5 million compounds.
      Although Mcule doesn't define what a building block is (at least, not that I
      can find), it\u2019s likely that their definition is similar to that of ZINC,
      which defines building blocks as \u201Cthose catalogs of compounds available
      in preparative quantities, typically 250 mg or more\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559\\\">ref</a>).
      This seems like a reasonable proxy for the sorts of compounds synthetic chemists
      might use in reactions. I defined patterns to match a bunch of functional groups
      using SMARTS/SMILES, and then used RDKit to find matches in the Mcule building
      blocks database. The code can be found on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule\\\">Github</a>,
      along with the patterns I used.</p><p>The results are shown below. As expected,
      ethers, amines, amides, and alcohols are quite common. Surprisingly, aryl chlorides
      aren't that much more common than aryl bromides\u2014and, except for aliphatic
      fluorides, all aliphatic halides are quite rare. Allenes, carbodiimides, and
      SF5 groups are virtually unheard of (&lt;100 examples).</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      of the SMILES files generated (also on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule/output\\\">Github</a>),

      there are some faulty matches. I wouldn\u2019t consider these publication-quality
      numbers yet.)</p><p>An obvious caveat: there are lots of commercially \u201Crare\u201D
      functional groups which are easily accessible from more abundant functional
      groups. For instance, acid chlorides seem uncommon in the above table, but can
      usually be made from ubiquitous carboxylic acids with e.g. SOCl2. So these data
      shouldn\u2019t be taken as a proxy for a more holistic measure of synthetic
      accessibility\u2014they measure commercial availability, that\u2019s all.</p><p>What
      conclusions can we draw from this?</p><ul><li><p>The most common functional
      groups are the milquetoast ones: alcohols, amines, esters, etc. Perhaps this
      explains <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409\\\">where
      all the new reactions have gone</a>: unless your new method works on alcohols
      or amines, it will struggle to get traction in most of chemical space relative
      to e.g. Williamson ether synthesis or reductive amination. (Kudos to MacMillan
      for identifying this; <em>vide supra</em>.)</p></li><li><p>Ureas are much more
      common than you\u2019d expect from academic methods papers. This I think speaks
      to the difference between what methodologists want and what medicinal chemists
      want. Ureas are a bit annoying to work with: they\u2019re pretty polar by the
      standards of academia, they\u2019re not always soluble in organic solvents,
      and they have a tendency to stick to transition metal catalysts or get deprotonated
      by strong bases. But they\u2019re easy to make in libraries, since the isocyanate/amine
      disconnection is so robust, and they\u2019re excellent hydrogen-bond donors
      and acceptors. <strong>CORRECTION: There's a SMARTS error, so the match for
      \\\"ureas\\\" actually matches amides\u2014disregard this section. Thanks to
      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/wmdhn\\\">@wmdhn</a> for catching this.</strong></p></li><li><p>Uncommon
      functional groups, like SF<sub>5</sub> and allenes, are very uncommon. If you
      want to introduce an SF<sub>5</sub> group, you are in for a rough time: there
      aren\u2019t great ways to add it to molecules (although there have been some
      steps forward <a href=\\\"https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.202201491\\\">in
      recent years</a>), and there are only 18 commercial examples. So people can
      write as many <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728329/\\\">papers</a>
      as they want about how cool SF<sub>5</sub> groups are: I still doubt we\u2019ll
      see them used very much in the near future.</p></li><li><p>But also, the abundance
      of a given functional group is very elastic in the long run. Trifluoromethyl
      groups used to be extremely rare\u2014they\u2019re not found in nature!\u2014but
      now 1 in 8 molecules has a CF<sub>3</sub> group. CF<sub>3</sub> just turns out
      to be a very good handle for a lot of molecular design tasks, and so people
      found ways to introduce it all over the place, and now it\u2019s not hard to
      get molecules that have trifluoromethyl groups. Synthetic chemists should feel
      good about this.</p></li></ul><p>The functional-group-specific SMILES files
      are in the previously mentioned Github repo, so anyone who wants to e.g. look
      through all the commercially available alkenes and perform further cheminformatics
      analyses can do so. I hope the attached code and data helps other chemists perform
      similar, and better, studies, and that this sort of thinking can be useful for
      those who are currently engaged in reaction discovery.</p><p><em>Thanks to Eric

      polarisation is sheer loss to us all. To us as people, and to our society. It
      is at the same time practical and intellectual and creative loss, and I repeat
      that it is false to imagine that those three considerations are clearly separable.
      But for a moment I want to concentrate on the intellectual loss.</p></blockquote><p>Snow\u2019s
      essay is wonderful: his portrait of a vanishing cultural intellectual unity
      should inspire us all, scientists and otherwise, to improve ourselves, and the
      elegiac prose reminds the reader that even the best cultural institutions are
      fragile and fleeting things.</p><p>I want to make an analogous\u2014but much
      less powerful\u2014observation about the two cultures present in atomistic simulation.
      I\u2019ll call these the \u201CQM tribe\u201D and the \u201CMD tribe\u201D for
      convenience: crudely, \u201Cpeople who use Gaussian/ORCA/Psi4 for their research\u201D
      and \u201Cpeople who use Schrodinger/AMBER/OpenMM/LAMMPS for their research,\u201D
      respectively. Although this dichotomy is crude, I contend there are real differences
      between these two groups, and that their disunity hurts scientific progress.</p><h2><strong>The
      Nature of Energy Surfaces</strong></h2><p>The most fundamental disagreement
      between these two cultures is in how they think about energy surfaces, I think.
      Most QM-tribe people think in terms of optimizing to discrete critical points
      on the potential energy surface: one can perform some sort of gradient-informed
      optimization to a ground state, or follow negative eigenvalues to a transition
      state.</p><p>Implicit to this assumption is that there exist well-defined critical
      points on the PES, and that finding such critical points is meaningful and productive.
      Conformers exist, and many people now compute properties as Boltzmann-weighted
      averages over conformational ensembles, but this is usually done for 10\u2013100
      conformers, not thousands or millions. Entropy and solvation, if they\u2019re
      considered at all, are viewed as corrections, not key factors: since QM is so
      frequently used to study high-barrier bond-breaking processes where enthalpic
      factors dominate, one can often get reasonable results with cartoonish treatments
      of entropy.</p><p>In contrast, MD-tribe scientists generally don\u2019t think
      about transition states as specific configurations of atoms\u2014rather, a transition
      state can emerge from some sort of simulation involving biased sampling, but
      it\u2019s just a position along some abstract reaction coordinate, rather than
      a structure which can be visualized in CYLView. Any information gleaned is statistical,
      rather than concretely visual (e.g. \u201Cwhat is the mean number of hydrogen
      bonds to this oxygen near this transition state\u201D).</p><p>Unlike the QM
      tribe, MD-tribe scientists generally cannot study bond-breaking processes, and
      so focus on conformational processes (protein folding, aggregation, nucleation,
      transport) where entropy and solvation are of critical importance: as such,
      free energy is almost always taken into consideration by MD-tribe scientists,
      and the underlying PES itself is rarely (to my knowledge) viewed as a worthy
      topic of study in and of itself.</p><h2><strong>Molecular Representations</strong></h2><p>This
      divide also affects how the two cultures view the task of molecular representation.
      QM-tribe scientists generally view a list of coordinates and atomic numbers
      as the most logical representation of a molecule (perhaps with charge and multiplicity
      information). To the QM tribe, a minimum on the PES represents a structure,
      and different minima naturally ought to have different representations. Bonding
      and bond order are not specified, because QM methods can figure that out without
      assistance (and it\u2019s not uncommon for bonds to change in a QM simulation
      anyway).</p><p>In contrast, people in the MD tribe generally want a molecular
      representation that\u2019s independent of conformation, since many different
      conformations will intrinsically be considered. (See Connor Coley\u2019s <a
      href=\\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMZ8GHvvJv_jhy8t6fH73wv4e9ZjHwUN/view\\\">presentation</a>
      from a recent MolSSI workshop for a discussion of this.) Thus, it\u2019s common
      to represent molecules through their topology, where connectivity and bond order
      are explicitly specified. This allows for some pretty wild <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00241a001\\\">simulations</a>
      of species that would be reactive in a QM simulation, but also means that e.g.
      tautomers can be a massive problem in MD (<a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9920-5\\\">ref</a>),
      since protons can\u2019t equilibrate freely.</p><p>For property prediction,
      an uneasy compromise can be reached wherein one takes a SMILES string, performs
      a conformational search, and then Boltzmann-averages properties over all different
      conformers, to return a set of values which are associated only with the SMILES
      string and not any individual conformation. (Matt Sigman does this, as does
      Bobby Paton <a href=\\\"https://nova.chem.colostate.edu/cascade/predict/\\\">for
      NMR prediction.</a>) This is a lot of work, though.</p><h2><strong>\u201CA Gulf
      Of Mutual Incomprehension\u201D</strong></h2><p>These differences also become
      apparent when comparing the software packages that different tribes use. Take,
      for instance, the task of predicting partial charges for a given small molecule.
      A QM-tribe scientist would expect these charges to be a function of the geometry,
      whereas an MD-tribe scientist would want the results to be explicitly geometry-independent
      (<a href=\\\"https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(22)01326-1\\\">e.g.</a>)
      so that they can be used for subsequent MD simulations.</p><p>The assumptions
      implicit to these worldviews mean that it\u2019s often quite difficult to go
      from QM-tribe software packages to MD-tribe software packages or vice versa.
      I\u2019ve been <a href=\\\"https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/611\\\">stymied</a>
      before by trying to get OpenMM and openforcefield to work on organic molecules
      for which I had a list of coordinates and not e.g. a SMILES string\u2014although
      obviously coordinates will at some point be needed in the MD simulation, most
      workflows expect you to start from a topology and not an xyz file.</p><p>Similarly,
      it\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview/issues/589#issuecomment-468339971\\\">very
      difficult</a> to get the graphics package NGLView to illustrate the process
      of bonds breaking and forming\u2014NGLView is typically used for MD, and expects
      that the system\u2019s topology will be defined at the start of the simulation
      and never changed. (There are kludgy workarounds, like defining a new object
      for every frame, but it\u2019s nevertheless true that NGLView is not made for
      QM-tribe people.)</p><p>(I\u2019m sure that MD-tribe people are very frustrated
      by QM software as well, but I don\u2019t have as much experience going in this
      direction. In general, MD tooling seems quite a bit more advanced than QM-tribe
      tooling; most MD people I\u2019ve talked to seem to interact with QM software
      as little as possible, and I can\u2019t say I blame them.)</p><h2><strong>\u201CA
      Curious Distorted Image of Each Other\u201D</strong></h2><p>There are also cultural
      factors to consider here. The questions that QM-tribe scientists think about
      are different than those that MD-tribe scientists think about: a somewhat famous
      QM expert once told me that they were \u201Cstuck on an ivory tower where people
      hold their nose when it comes to DFT, forget anything more approximate,\u201D
      whereas MD-tribe scientists often seem alarmingly unconcerned about forcefield
      error but are obsessed with proper sampling and simulation convergence.</p><p>It
      seems that most people have only a vague sense of what their congeners in the
      other tribe actually work on. I don\u2019t think most QM-tribe scientists I
      know have ever run or analyzed a regular molecular dynamics simulation using
      e.g. AMBER or OpenMM, nor do I expect that most MD-tribe scientists have tried
      to find a transition state in Gaussian or ORCA. In theory, coursework could
      remedy this, but education for QM alone already seems chaotic and ad hoc\u2014trying
      to cram in MD, statistical mechanics, etc is probably ill-advised at the present.</p><p>Social
      considerations also play a role. There\u2019s limited crosstalk between the
      two fields, especially at the trainee level. How many QM people even know who
      Prayush Tiwary is, or Michael Shirts, or Jay Ponder? How many MD graduate students
      have heard of Frank Neese or Troy Van Voorhis? As always, generational talent
      manages to transcend narrow boundaries\u2014but rank-and-file scientists would
      benefit immensely from increased contact with the other tribe.</p><h2><strong>\u201CUnite
      Them\u201D</strong></h2><p>I\u2019m not an expert on the history of chemistry,
      but my understanding is that the two fields were not always so different: Martin
      Karplus, Arieh Warshel, and Bill Jorgensen, key figures in the development of
      modern MD, were also formidable quantum chemists. (If any famous chemists who
      read this blog care to share their thoughts on this history, please email me:
      you know who you are!)</p><p>And as the two fields advance, I think they will
      come closer together once more. As QM becomes capable of tackling larger and
      larger systems, QM-tribe scientists will be forced to deal with more and more
      complicated conformational landscapes: modern enantioselective catalysts routinely
      have hundreds of ground-state complexes to consider (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/sc/d2sc02274e\\\">ref</a>),
      and QSimulate and Amgen recently reported full DFT calculations on protein\u2013ligand
      complexes (<a href=\\\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/345075772.pdf\\\">ref</a>).</p><p>Similarly,
      the increase in computing power means that many MD use cases (like FEP) are
      now limited not by insufficient sampling but by the poor energetics of the forcefields
      they employ. This is difficult to prove unequivocally, but I\u2019ve heard this
      in interviews with industry folks, and there are certainly plenty of references
      complaining about poor forcefield accuracy (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00801\\\">1</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01081\\\">2</a>): a
      Psivant <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00564\\\">review</a>
      dryly notes that \u201Chistorically solvation energy errors on the order of
      2\u20133 kcal/mol have been considered to be accurate,\u201D which is hardly
      encouraging.</p><p>Many QM-tribe professors now work on dynamics: Dean Tantillo
      and Todd Martinez (who have long been voices \u201Ccrying out in the wilderness\u201D
      for dynamics) perhaps most prominently, but also Steven Lopez, Daniel Ess, Fernanda
      Duarte, Peng Liu, etc. And MD-tribe professors seem more and more interested
      in using ML mimics of QM to replace forcefields (<a href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227959v1\\\">e.g.</a>),
      which will inevitably lead them down the speed\u2013accuracy rabbit hole that
      is quantum chemistry. So it seems likely to me that the two fields will increasingly
      reunite, and that being a good 21st-century computational chemist will require
      competency in both areas.</p><p>If this is true, the conclusions for individual
      computational chemists are obvious: learn techniques outside your specialty,
      before you get forcibly dragged along by the current of scientific progress!
      There\u2019s plenty to learn from the other culture of people that deals with
      more-or-less the same scientific problems you do, and no reason to wait.</p><p><em>As
      a denizen of quantum chemistry myself, I apologize for any misrepresentations

      in how calculations are performed: instead of finding well-defined extrema on
      the electronic potential energy surface (ground states or transition states),
      molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo simulations must be used to sample from
      an underlying distribution of structures and reconstruct the free energy surface.
      Sufficient sampling usually requires consideration of 10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>6</sup>
      individual structures,<sup>2</sup> meaning that each individual computation

      these techniques are still ignored by most organic chemists.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Given
      the complexity this introduces, it\u2019s not surprising that most computational
      organic chemists try to avoid explicit solvent at all costs. The typical workaround
      is to use \u201Cimplicit solvent\u201D models, which \u201Creduce the complexity
      of individual solvent\u2212solute interactions such as hydrogen-bond, dipole\u2212dipole,
      and van der Waals interactions into a fictitious surface potential... scaled
      to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00456?src=recsys\\\">Baik</a>).
      This preserves the well-defined potential energy surfaces that organic chemists
      are accustomed to, so you can still find transition states by eigenvector following,
      etc.</p><p>Implicit solvent models like PCM, COSMO, or SMD are better than nothing,
      but are known to struggle for charged species. In particular, they don\u2019t
      really describe explicit inner-sphere solvent\u2013solute interactions (like
      hydrogen bonding), meaning that they\u2019ll behave poorly when these interactions
      are important. Dan Singleton\u2019s paper on <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392\\\">the
      Baylis\u2013Hillman reaction</a> is a nice case study of how badly implicit
      solvent can fail: even high-level quantum chemical methods are useless when
      solvation free energies are 10 kcal/mol off from experiment!</p><p>This issue
      is well-known. To quote from <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201709943\\\">Schreiner
      and Grimme</a>:</p><blockquote><p>An even more important but still open issue
      is solvation. In the opinion of the authors it is a \u2018scandal\u2019 that
      in 2018 no routine free energy solvation method is available beyond (moderately
      successful) continuum theories such as COSMO-RS and SMD and classical FF/MD-based
      explicit treatments.</p></blockquote><p>When computational studies have been
      performed in explicit solvent, the results have often been promising: Singleton
      has studied <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.0c06295\\\">diene
      hydrochlorination</a> and <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b07328\\\">nitration
      of toluene</a>, and Peng Liu has recently conducted a nice <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c12096\\\">study
      of chemical glycosylation</a>. Nevertheless, these studies all require heroic
      levels of effort: quantum chemistry is still very slow, and so a single free
      energy surface might take months and months to compute.<sup>3</sup></p><p>One
      promising workaround is using machine learning to accelerate quantum chemistry.
      Since these MD-type studies look at the same exact system over and over again,
      we could imagine first training some sort of ML model based on high-level quantum
      chemistry data, and then employing this model over and over again for the actual
      MD run. As long as (1) the ML model is faster than the QM method used to train
      it and (2) it takes less data to train the ML model than it would to run the
      simulation, this will save time: in most cases, a lot of time.</p><p>(This is
      a somewhat different use case than e.g. <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c6sc05720a\\\">ANI</a>-type
      models, which aim to achieve decent accuracy for any organic molecule. Here,
      we already know what system we want to study, and we\u2019re willing to do some
      training up front.)</p><p>A lot of people are working in this field right now,
      but today I want to highlight some work that I liked from Fernanda Duarte and
      co-workers. Last year, they published a <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d2cp02978b#cit23\\\">paper</a>
      comparing a few different ML methods for studying quasiclassical dynamics (in
      the gas phase), and found that atomic cluster expansion (ACE) performed better
      than Gaussian approximation potentials while training faster than NequIP. They
      then went on to show that ACE models could be trained automatically through
      active learning, and used the models to successfully predict product ratios
      for cycloadditions with post-TS bifurcations.</p><p>Their new <a href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a8085fba3e99daefab8f89\\\">paper</a>,
      posted on ChemRxiv yesterday, applies the same ACE/active learning approach
      to studying reactions in explicit solvent, with the reaction of cyclopentadiene
      and methyl vinyl ketone chosen as a model system. This is more challenging than
      their previous work, because the ML model now not only has to recapitulate the
      solute reactivity but also the solute\u2013solvent and solvent\u2013solvent
      interactions. To try and capture all the different interactions efficiently,
      the authors ended up using four different sets of training data: substrates
      only, substrates with 2 solvent molecules, substrates with 33 solvent molecules,
      and clusters of solvent only.</p><p>Previously, the authors used an energy-based
      selector to determine if a structure should be added to the training set: they
      predicted the energy with the model, ran a QM calculation, and selected the
      structure if the difference between the two values was big enough. This approach
      makes a lot of sense, but has the unfortunate downside that a lot of QM calculations
      are needed, which is exactly what this ML-based approach is trying to avoid.
      Here, the authors found that they could use similarity-based descriptors to
      select data points to add to the training set: these descriptors are both more
      efficient (needing fewer structures to converge) and faster to compute, making
      them overall a much better choice. (This approach is reminiscent of the metadynamics-based
      approach previously <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07240\\\">reported</a>
      by John Parkhill and co-workers.)</p><p>With a properly trained model in hand,
      the authors went on to study the reaction with biased sampling MD. They find
      that the reaction is indeed accelerated in explicit water, and that the free
      energy surface begins to look stepwise, as opposed to the concerted mechanism
      predicted in implicit solvent. (Singleton has observed similar behavior <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja208779k\\\">before</a>,
      and <a href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6362b49531107263acfa50e6\\\">I\u2019ve
      seen this too.</a>) They do some other interesting studies: they look at the
      difference between methanol and water as solvents, argue that Houk is wrong
      about the role of water in the TS,<sup>4</sup> and suggest that the hydrophobic
      effect drives solvent-induced rate acceleration.<sup>5</sup></p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      Duarte and co-workers have shown that ML can be used to solve an age-old problem
      in chemical simulation; if explicit solvent ML/MD simulations of organic reactions
      become easy enough for non-experts to run, I have no doubt that they will become
      a valued and essential part of the physical organic chemistry toolbox. Much
      work is needed to get to that point\u2014new software packages, further validation
      on new systems, new ways to assess quality and check robustness of simulations,
      and much more\u2014but the vision behind this paper is powerful, and I can\u2019t
      wait until it comes to fruition.</p><p><em>Thanks to Croix Laconsay for reading

      the system in question, and what processes are being studied. But in general
      insufficient sampling is a big issue in molecular dynamics, which I think is
      underappreciated by organic chemists wading into the area. Jeff Grossman has
      a <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00833\\\">nice
      paper on this</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you look carefully, many people who claim
      to be doing big <em>ab initio</em> molecular dynamics studies are actually doing
      semiempirical molecular dynamics. This isn\u2019t dishonest per se, but it\u2019s
      a little underwhelming to a computational chemist, especially when it\u2019s
      only mentioned in the SI. Things get even more confusing when plane wave DFT
      is employed: in theory, plane wave DFT can be just as accurate as regular DFT,
      but in practice there are some sneaky approximations that often get introduced.</p></li><li><p>This
      argument hinges on whether uphill dynamics (starting from reactants, going to
      transition state) or downhill dynamics (starting from transition state, going
      to reactants) are more appropriate. The authors argue that \\\"uphill dynamics
      allow the solvent sufficient time to reorganise [<em>sic</em>] before the trajectory
      passes the free energy barrier, providing a more realistic view of solvent behaviour
      [<em>sic</em>] during the reaction.\\\" I'm not fully convinced by this\u2014isn't
      the idea that the system reorganizes to minimize the energy of the transition
      state a basic precept of transition state theory? But I'm not convinced I understand
      these issues deeply enough to have an opinion; I will leave this to the experts.</p></li><li><p>This

      about how academia is ultimately an educational institution, and how this limits
      the quality of academic research. (It\u2019s worth a read; I\u2019ve written
      about these issues from a <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221026_structural_diversity.html\\\">few</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230502_startups.html\\\">angles</a>,
      and will probably write more at a later date.)</p><p>The major alternative to
      academic research that people put forward is <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5\\\">focused
      research organizations</a> (FROs): large, non-profit research organizations
      capable of tackling big unsolved problems. These organizations, similar in scope
      and ambition to e.g. CERN or LIGO, are envisioned to operate with a budget of
      $20\u2013100M over five years, making them substantially larger and more expensive
      than a single academic lab. This model is still being tested, but it seems likely
      that some version of FROs will prove effective for appropriately sized problems.</p><p>But
      FROs have some disadvantages, too: they represent a significant investment on
      the part of funders, and so it\u2019s important to choose projects where there\u2019s
      a high likelihood of impact in the given area. (In contrast, it\u2019s expected
      that most new academic labs will focus on high-risk projects, and pivot if things
      don\u2019t work out in a few years.) In this piece, I propose a new form of
      scientific organization that combines aspects of both FROs and academic labs:
      for-profit micro focused research organizations (FP\xB5FROs).</p><p>The key
      insight behind FP\xB5FROs is that existing financial markets could be used to
      fund scientific research when there is a realistic possibility for profit as
      a result of the research. This means that FP\xB5FROs need not be funded by the
      government or philanthropic spending, but could instead raise capital from e.g.
      venture capitalists or angel investors, who have access to substantially more
      money and are used to making high-risk, high-reward investments.</p><p>FP\xB5FROs
      would also be smaller and more nimble than full-fledged FROs, able to tackle
      high-risk problems just like academia. But unlike academic labs, FP\xB5FROs
      would be able to spend more freely and hire more aggressively, thus circumventing
      the human capital issues that plague academic research. While most academic
      labs are staffed entirely with inexperienced trainees (as Rodriques notes above),
      FP\xB5FROs could hire experienced scientists, engineers, and programmers, thus
      accelerating the rate of scientific progress.</p><p>One limitation of the FP\xB5FRO
      model is that research would need to be profitable within a reasonable time
      frame. But this limitation might actually be a blessing in disguise: the need
      for profitability means that FP\xB5FROs would be incentivized to provide real
      value to firms, thus preventing useless research through the magic of Adam Smith\u2019s
      invisible hand.</p><p>Another disadvantage of FP\xB5FROs is that they must be
      able to achieve success with relatively little funding (probably around $10M;
      big for academia, but small compared to a FRO). This means that their projects
      would have to be modest in scope. I think this is probably a blessing in disguise,
      though. Consider the following advice <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html\\\">from
      Paul Graham</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Empirically, the way to do really big things
      seems to be to start with deceptively small things.\u2026 Maybe it's a bad idea
      to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger your ambition, the
      longer it's going to take, and the further you project into the future, the
      more likely you'll get it wrong.</p></blockquote><p>Thus, the need for FP\xB5FROs
      to focus on getting a single \u201Cminimal viable product\u201D right might
      be very helpful, and could even lead to more impactful firms later on.</p><p>In
      conclusion, FP\xB5FROs could combine the best qualities of academic labs and
      FROs: they would be agile and risk-tolerant, like academic labs, but properly
      incentivized to produce useful research instead of publishing papers, like FROs.
      This novel model should be investigated further as a mechanism for generating
      new scientific discoveries at scale with immediate short-term utility.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p></p><p>Hopefully
      it\u2019s clear by now that this is a joke: an FP\xB5FRO is just a startup.</p><p>The
      point of this piece isn\u2019t to criticize FROs or academia: both have their
      unique advantages relative to startups, and much has been written about the
      relative advantages and disadvantages of different sorts of research institutions
      (<a href=\\\"https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros\\\">e.g.</a>).</p><p>Rather,
      I want to remind people that startups can do really good scientific work, something
      that many people seem to forget. It\u2019s true that basic research can be a
      public good, and something that\u2019s difficult to monetize within a reasonable
      timeframe. But most research today isn\u2019t quite this basic, which leads
      me to suspect that many activities today confined to academic labs could be
      profitably conducted in startups.</p><p>Academics are generally very skeptical
      of organizations motivated by profit. But all incentives are imperfect, and
      the drive to achieve profitability pushes companies to provide value to real
      customers, which is more than many academics motivated by publication or prestige
      ever manage to achieve. It seems likely that for organizations focused on applied
      research, profit is the least bad incentive.</p><p>I\u2019ll close with a quote
      from Eric Gilliam\u2019s recent <a href=\\\"https://www.freaktakes.com/p/an-alternative-approach-to-deep-tech\\\">essay</a>
      on a new model for \u201Cdeep tech\u201D startups:</p><blockquote><p>Our corporate
      R&amp;D labs in most industries have taken a step back in how \u201Cbasic\u201D
      their research is. Meanwhile, what universities call \u2018applied\u2019 research
      has become much less applied than it used to be. This \u2018middle\u2019 of
      the deep tech pipeline has been hollowed out.</p></blockquote><p>What Eric proposes
      in his piece, and what I\u2019m arguing here, is that scientific startups can
      help fill this void: not by replacing FROs and academic research, but by complementing
      them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Ari Wagen for reading a draft of this piece.</em></p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"TW:

      will always have the same p</em>K<em><sub>a</sub>, no matter the pH. This makes
      p</em>K<em><sub>a</sub> a very useful tool for ranking molecules by their acidity
      (e.g. <a href=\\\"http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf\\\">the
      Evans p</a></em><a href=\\\"http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf\\\">K</a><em><a
      href=\\\"http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf\\\"><sub>a</sub>
      table</a>).</em></p><p>The claim implicit in the definition of p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>
      is that a single parameter suffices to describe the acidity of each molecule.<sup>1</sup>
      In general, this isn\u2019t true in chemistry\u2014there\u2019s no single \u201Creactivity\u201D
      parameter which describes how reactive a given molecule is. For various regions
      of chemical space a two-parameter model can <a href=\\\"https://www.cup.lmu.de/oc/mayr/reaktionsdatenbank/\\\">work</a>,
      but in general we don\u2019t expect to be able to evaluate the efficacy of a
      given reaction by looking up the reactivity values of the reactants and seeing
      if they\u2019re close enough.</p><p>Instead, structure and reactivity interact
      with each other in complex, high-dimensional ways. A diene will react with an
      electron-poor alkene and not an alcohol, while acetyl chloride doesn\u2019t
      react with alkenes but will readily acetylate alcohols, and a free radical might
      ignore both the alkene and the alcohol and abstract a hydrogen from somewhere
      else. Making sense of this confusing morass of different behaviors is, on some
      level, what organic chemistry is all about. The fact that the reactivity of
      different functional groups depends on reaction conditions is key to most forms
      of synthesis!</p><p>But p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> isn\u2019t so complicated. If
      I want to know whether acetic acid will protonate pyridine in a given solvent,
      all I have to do is look up the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> values for acetic acid
      and pyridinium (pyridine\u2019s conjugate acid). If pyridinium has a higher
      p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>, protonation will be favored; otherwise, it\u2019ll
      be disfavored. More generally, one can predict the equilibrium distribution
      of protons amongst <em>N</em> different sites from a list of the corresponding
      p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>s.</p><p>Why is p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> so well-behaved?
      The key assumption underlying the above definition is that ions are free and
      do not interact with one another. This allows us to neglect any specific ion\u2013ion
      interactions, and makes the scale universal: if the pyridinium cation and the
      acetate anion never interact, then I can learn everything I need to about pyridinium
      acetate just by measuring the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>s of pyridine and acetic
      acid in isolation.</p><p>This assumption is quite good in solvents like water
      or DMSO, which excel at stabilizing charged species, but progressively breaks
      down as one travels to the realm of nonpolar solvents. As ions start to pair
      with themselves, specific molecule\u2013molecule interactions become important.
      The relative size of the anions can matter: in a nonpolar solvent, a small anion
      will be better stabilized by a small cation than by a large, diffuse cation,
      meaning that e.g. acetate will appear more acidic when protonating smaller molecules.
      Other more quotidian intermolecular interactions, like hydrogen bonding and
      \u03C0-stacking, can also play a role.</p><p>And the ions aren\u2019t the only
      thing that can stick together: aggregation of acids is often observed in nonpolar
      solvents. Benzenesulfonic acid <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.2116/analsci.15.303\\\">forms
      a trimer</a> in benzonitrile solution, which is still pretty polar, and alcohols
      and carboxylic acids are known to aggregate under a variety of conditions as
      well.<sup>2</sup> Even seemingly innocuous species like tetrabutylammonium chloride
      will aggregate at high concentrations (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja9723139\\\">ref</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1995/c3/c39950002513\\\">ref</a>).</p><p>To
      reliably extend p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> scales to nonpolar solvents, one must
      thus deliberately choose compounds which resist aggregation. As the dielectric
      constant drops, so does the number of such compounds. The clearest demonstration
      of this I\u2019ve found is a series of papers (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo9713013\\\">1</a>,

      the futility of measuring p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> in nonpolar media from the
      standpoint of the synthetic chemist. If only weird fluoroalkanes engineered
      not to aggregate can have p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> values, then the scale may
      be analytically robust, but it\u2019s hardly useful for designing reactions!</p><p>The
      key point here is that the difficulty of measuring p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> in
      nonpolar media is not an analytical barrier which can be surmounted by new and
      improved technologies, but rather a fundamental breakdown in the idea of p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>
      itself. Even the best p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> measurement tool in the world
      can\u2019t determine the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> of HCl in hexanes, because
      no such value exists\u2014the concept itself is borderline nonsensical. Chloride
      will ion-pair with everything in hexanes, hydrogen chloride will aggregate with
      itself, chloride will stick to hydrogen chloride, and so forth. Asking for a
      p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> in this context just doesn't make much sense.<sup>3</sup></p><p>It\u2019s
      important to remember, however, that just because the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>
      scale no longer functions in nonpolar solvents doesn\u2019t mean that acids
      don\u2019t have different acidities. Triflic acid in toluene will still protonate
      just about <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol061174+\\\">everything</a>,
      whereas acetic acid will not. Instead, chemists wishing to think about acidity
      in nonpolar media have to accept 1that no one-dimensional scale will be forthcoming.
      The idealized world of p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> we\u2019re accustomed to may
      no longer function in nonpolar solvents, but chemistry itself still works just
      fine.</p><p><em>Thanks to Ivo Leito for discussing these topics with me over

      one person is really looking out for your best interests: you. Your advisor,

      work to mindless SI work. Any project will take some grinding, but the thinking
      work is (ideally) what you\u2019ve been recruited for, what you\u2019ll present
      on, and what\u2019ll get you a job. If your advisor views you only as a set
      of hands\u2026 be very worried.</p></li><li><p>Cold emails to scientists work
      much better than it seems they ought to. Most professors spend their entire
      career trying to get people to care about their work\u2014if you\u2019re interested,
      they\u2019ll usually talk your ear off.</p></li><li><p>Read your PI\u2019s old

      outcome focused. Each day, ask yourself \u201CWhat is the biggest problem I\u2019m
      facing in my research?\u201D If whatever you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t addressing
      that problem, you\u2019re wasting your time. Sometimes this means stopping all
      experiments and reading papers for a few weeks; sometimes this looks like running
      reactions; sometimes this looks like just sitting at your desk and writing.
      (h/t Brian Liau for giving me this advice when I started graduate school)</p></li><li><p>Be
      outcome focused on the big scale, too. Figure out what success in graduate school
      looks like\u2014what your ideal job is, and what it takes to get that sort of
      job\u2014and then pursue those outcomes relentlessly. Perhaps in an ideal world
      we could all follow our natural curiosity to our heart\u2019s content, but that\u2019s
      not real life, not in science as I\u2019ve known it.</p></li><li><p>Success
      in graduate school may be necessary for your life goals, but it won\u2019t be

      life on hold; don\u2019t make science the highest good in your worldview. (cf.

      critical of peer review in the past, arguing that it <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230427_journals.html\\\">doesn\u2019t
      accomplish much</a>, <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230320_domain_arbitrage.html\\\">contributes
      to status quo bias</a>, etc. But a few recent experiences remind me of the value
      that peer review provides: in today\u2019s scientific culture, peer review is
      essentially the only time that scientists get honest and unbiased feedback on
      their work.</p><p>How can this be true? In experimental science, scientists
      typically work alongside other students and postdocs under the supervision of
      a professor. This body of people forms a lab, also known as a research group,
      and it\u2019s to these people that you present most frequently. Your lab generally
      knows the techniques and methods that you employ very well: so if you\u2019ve
      misinterpreted a piece of data or designed an experiment poorly, group meeting
      is a great place to get feedback.</p><p>But a lab is also biased in certain
      ways. People are attracted to a lab because they think the science is exciting
      and shows promise, and so they\u2019re likely to be credulous about positive
      results. Certain labs also develop beliefs or dogmas about how to conduct science:
      the best ways to perform a mechanistic study, or the most useful reaction conditions.
      To some extent, every lab is a paradigm unto itself. This means that paradigm-shifting
      criticism is hard to find among one\u2019s coworkers, even if it\u2019s common
      in the outside world.</p><p>Here are some examples of controversial-in-the-field
      statements that are unlikely to be controversial within given labs:</p><ul><li><p>Palladium-based
      catalysis is going to become obsolete due to the scarcity of Pd and must be
      replaced. <a href=\\\"https://www.dal.ca/sites/stradiotto/research.html\\\">Some
      labs</a> build their research program around this; others think Pd will always
      be relevant.</p></li><li><p>Water is the greenest possible solvent. Some scientists
      believe this <a href=\\\"https://lipshutz.chem.ucsb.edu/research\\\">wholeheartedly</a>,
      while others think it\u2019s stupid (for instance, a 2021 <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-021-02188-8\\\">review</a>
      states that \u201Cto meet regulations concerning the discharge of waste water
      into rivers and other natural waters\u2026 [water] often requires very extensive
      treatment prior to discharge, making the use of water as a reaction medium much
      less attractive.\u201D)</p></li><li><p>More broadly, the belief that machine
      learning and generative AI are the future of chemical discovery: while many
      computational chemists believe this, plenty of experimentalists (even young
      ones) are pretty skeptical.</p></li></ul><p>In each of these cases, it\u2019s
      unlikely that criticism along these lines is available internally: people who\u2019ve
      chosen to do their PhDs studying ML in chemistry aren\u2019t likely to criticize
      your paper for overemphasizing the importance of ML in chemistry!</p><p>More
      generally, internal criticism works best when a lab serves as a shared repository
      of expertise, i.e. when everyone in the lab has roughly the same skillset. Some
      labs focus instead on a single overarching goal and employ many different tools
      to get to that point: a given chemical biology group might have a synthetic
      chemist, a MS specialist, a genomics guru, a mechanistic enzymologist, and someone
      specializing in cell culture. If this is the case, your techniques are opaque
      to your coworkers: what advice can someone who does cell culture give about
      improving Q-TOF signal-to-noise?</p><p>Ideally, one\u2019s professor is well-versed
      enough in each of the techniques employed that he or she can dispense criticism
      as needed. But professors are often busy, aren\u2019t always operational experts
      at each of the techniques they oversee, and suffer from the same viewpoint biases
      that their students do (perhaps even more so).</p><p>So, it\u2019s important
      to solicit feedback from external sources. Unfortunately, at least in my experience
      most external feedback is too positive: \u201Cgreat talk,\u201D \u201Cnice job,\u201D
      etc. Our scientific culture tries so hard to be supportive that I almost never
      get any meaningful criticism from people outside my group, either publicly or
      privately. (Ideally one\u2019s committee would help, but I never really got
      to present research results to my committee, and this doesn\u2019t help postdocs
      anyhow.)</p><p>Peer review, then, serves as the last bastion against low-quality
      science: reviewers are outside the lab, have no incentive to be nice, and are
      tasked specifically with poking holes in your argument or pointing out extra
      experiments that would improve it. Peer review has improved each one of my papers,
      and I\u2019m grateful for it.<a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/fn1\\\"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>What\u2019s
      a little sad is that the excellent feedback that reviewers give only comes at
      the bitter end of a project, which for me has often meant that the results are
      more than a year old and my collaborators have moved on. Much more useful would
      be critical feedback delivered early on in a project, when my own thinking is
      more flexible and the barrier to running additional experiments is lower. And
      more useful still would be high-quality criticism available at every step of
      the project, given not anonymously but by people whom you can talk to and learn
      from.</p><p>What might this practically look like?</p><ul><li><p>A culture of
      \u201Cred teaming,\u201D where students are incentivized to find flaws in others\u2019
      projects in somewhat adversarial ways. This would need to be done within a supportive
      and collegial atmosphere, lest it degenerate into bullying: red teaming need
      not be red in tooth and claw.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, PIs could invite other
      professors to come to group meetings and (constructively) criticize the projects,
      particularly professors from adjacent subfields who might have different perspectives.</p></li><li><p>Poster
      presentations or talks (at conferences), although often used to present finished
      projects, can also be used to present unfinished work. I presented some unfinished
      work at <a href=\\\"http://jiwu.chem.uh.edu/tpoc.html\\\">TPOC</a> a few years
      ago, and got really helpful suggestions from Ken Houk and Dean Tantillo that
      fundamentally changed how we approached the rest of the project. Maybe this
      is something that we should encourage more, although finished projects will
      probably always look more impressive than unfinished projects.</p></li><li><p>Decentralized
      peer review solutions like <em><a href=\\\"https://www.theseedsofscience.org/\\\">Seeds
      of Science</a></em> or <em><a href=\\\"https://pubpeer.com/\\\">PubPeer</a></em>
      might also help here, but my sense is that it\u2019s unlikely that qualified
      experts will just spend their time investigating something that they found online;
      they need to be solicited somehow.</p></li></ul><p>I don\u2019t know what the
      right solution looks like here: the burden of peer review is already substantial,
      and I don\u2019t mean to suggest that this work ought to be arbitrarily multiplied
      for free. But I do worry that eliminating peer review, absent other changes,
      would simply mean that one of the only meaningful chances to get unfiltered
      feedback on one\u2019s science would be eliminated, and that this would be bad.</p><p><em>Thanks
      to Croix Laconsay and Lucas Karas for helpful feedback on this piece.</em></p><h3><strong>Footnotes</strong></h3><ol><li><p>It's
      also true that the threat of peer review increases paper quality. I agree with

      that this is important today, but am less convinced that this is necessary from
      an institutional design perspective: if peer review didn't exist, I think some

      science. See the \\\"Anarchic Preprint Lake\\\" discussion in <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230427_journals.html\\\">my

      started reading about organic chemistry more and more, albeit with no rhyme
      or reason to my study. I didn\u2019t know what the good textbooks were, what

      progressing further. Organic chemistry was just a \u201C<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game\\\">glass

      support of a teacher and a half-dozen friends who also wanted to learn more
      organic chemistry, we started a little independent study. We met in a closet

      we had no lab, and thus no practical knowledge. We split into two groups and
      tried to come up with experiments for ourselves, but the results were dismal.
      Here\u2019s the procedure (copied verbatim) for the one and only reaction we
      ran, synthesis of nitrobenzene via nitration of benzene, which was to be the
      first step in a multistep synthesis of Kevlar:</p><blockquote><p>In a 250 mL
      beaker, dissolve benzene in a solution of concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
      of twice its volume. Use an ice-salt bath to bring this solution to 0 \xB0C
      or below, and use a Pasteur pipette to slowly add a 1:1 solution of HNO<sub>3</sub>
      and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (be sure to keep the solution below 15 degrees
      Celsius at all times, as the reaction is strongly exothermic). Once all the
      solution has been added, warm it to room temperature and allow it to sit for
      15 minutes.<br><br>Pour the solution over 50 g of crushed ice in a 250 mL beaker.
      Once the ice has melted, isolate the product via vacuum filtration via a Buchner
      funnel and rinse it twice with water and twice with methanol. Recrystallize
      in a solution of methanol.</p></blockquote><p>The astute observer will notice
      that there aren\u2019t very many details here. How much benzene? How much nitric
      acid? We didn\u2019t have the glassware mentioned above\u2014neither a beaker
      nor a Buchner funnel. And, perhaps most damningly, the procedure calls for isolation
      by filtration, challenging since nitrobenzene is a liquid at room temperature.</p><p>Despite
      these problems, we successfully ran this reaction (open to air, not in a fume
      hood), and obtained the product. I vividly recall the yellow bubbles of nitrobenzene
      floating to the top of the vial, and the smell of cherries that filled the room,
      a smell that returns to me in Proustian fashion from time to time when using
      certain reagents. We didn\u2019t have a separatory funnel (or we didn\u2019t
      know how to use it if we did), so we fished some of the nitrobenzene out with
      a Pasteur pipette and threw the rest away.</p><p>A little bit of knowledge would
      have served us well, as would have gloves and a fume hood. Here\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene\\\">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Prolonged
      exposure [to nitrobenzene] may cause serious damage to the central nervous system,
      impair vision, cause liver or kidney damage, anemia and lung irritation. Inhalation
      of vapors may induce headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, cyanosis, weakness
      in the arms and legs, and in rare cases may be fatal\u2026<br><br>Nitrobenzene
      is considered a likely human carcinogen by the United States Environmental Protection
      Agency, and is classified by the IARC as a Group 2B carcinogen which is \\\"possibly
      carcinogenic to humans\\\".</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, a coworker of mine would
      later be sent to the hospital after spilling nitrobenzene on herself. Surprisingly,
      my group\u2019s experiment still ended up being the safer one\u2014the lab portion
      of our course was disbanded the following day after my classmates caused an
      explosion with thionyl chloride.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to land a summer
      research internship in the Sessler lab at UT the following summer, and I started
      studying chemistry in earnest: column chromatography, Anslyn/Dougherty, NMR
      spectroscopy, and all the rest. I remember the first reaction I ran at UT: retro-Friedel\u2013Crafts
      dealkylation of a calix[4]arene, using about 10 g each of phenol and aluminum(III)
      chloride. The brutal physicality of lab work was a nice contrast to the gnosticism
      of software (where I\u2019d worked previously), and I was hooked.</p><p>I\u2019ll
      fast-forward through the more recent parts of my chemical career: I went to
      MIT and joined the Imperiali lab to work on essentially a medicinal chemistry
      project: hit-to-lead optimization, featuring lots of de novo heterocycle synthesis.
      I got to cook reactions in molten urea, quench 500 mL of phosphorus oxychloride
      at a time, and even design new routes (with a little oversight from my postdoc).
      It was awesome.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link

      My tenure in the Buchwald lab also introduced me to the importance of computations,
      which became a key part of my doctoral work, particularly when we were sent
      home in March of my first year. COVID gave me the opportunity to pursue some

      June 5th, and cleaned out my hood last week. For the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll
      be a purely computational chemist\u2014computation is advancing quickly, and
      I think that\u2019s where I have the most to offer the field right now. But
      I\u2019ll miss the sights and sounds of the lab. There\u2019s a satisfaction
      to making a new molecule and holding the final product in your hands: the knowledge
      that you\u2019ve reshaped this little corner of reality through your own actions,
      and that this particular arrangement of matter has never existed before.</p><p>And
      simulation is, at the end of the day, only useful insofar as it helps us make
      real molecules. There may be people who wish to model reactions purely for the
      sake of modeling them, but I am not one of them. What drew me to simulation
      initially, and what still attracts me to the field today, is its potential to
      help experimental scientists do their work faster and better. It was easy for
      me to ensure that this was true when I was both doing the experiments and running
      the simulations; my incentives were aligned properly. It will be harder in the
      future.</p><p>There\u2019s a seductive appeal in leaving lab work behind altogether,
      too, and one that\u2019s dangerous. Any experimentalist who\u2019s worked with
      a computational collaborator knows that nothing ever works precisely as modeled.
      There are untold depths of chemical behavior still inaccessible to the idealized
      world of simulation, and it\u2019s all too easy for computational chemists just
      to look the other way. Life is easier when you don\u2019t have to deal with
      sludgy workups or poorly soluble intermediates, but they don\u2019t go away
      just because you can\u2019t model them by DFT\u2014reality has a way of keeping
      us honest that simulations frequently lack.</p><p>So, although I bid lab farewell
      at this point in my career, it\u2019s a bittersweet parting. I hope to return
      someday; only time will tell.</p><p><em>Thanks to Jacob Thackston for reading

      thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions
      to your problems.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve fallen into a 1x/week update
      schedule, which seems to work pretty well: enough to keep the routine up, but
      not so much that it\u2019s a serious distraction from my actual job. I hope
      to maintain this schedule for the foreseeable future, and recommend it to other

      initially thought. In this piece, I want to dig a little deeper into the chemistry
      behind Varda, and discuss some potential advantages and challenges of the approach
      they\u2019re exploring.</p><p>Much of my confusion was quickly resolved by realizing
      that Varda is not actually \u201Cmaking drugs in orbit,\u201D or not in the
      way that an organic chemist would interpret that sentence. Varda\u2019s proposal
      is actually much more specific: they aim to crystallize active pharmaceutical
      ingredients (APIs, i.e. finished drug molecules) in microgravity, allowing them
      to access crystal forms and particle size distributions which can\u2019t be
      made under terrestrial conditions. To quote from <a href=\\\"https://varda.com/wp-content/uploads/varda-info-sheet-mar23_pharmaceutical.pdf\\\">their
      website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Varda\u2019s microgravity platform is grounded
      in decades of proven research conducted on NASA\u2019s space stations. By eliminating
      factors such as natural convection and sedimentation, processing in a microgravity
      environment provides a unique path to formulating small molecules and biologics
      that traditional manufacturing processes cannot address. The resulting tunable
      particle size distributions, more ordered crystals, and new forms can lead to
      improved bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual property, and
      new routes of administration.</p></blockquote><p>Crystallization is an excellent
      target for a new and expensive manufacturing process because it\u2019s at once
      very important and very hard to control. The goal of crystallization is to grow
      crystals of a given compound, fitting the component molecules together into
      a perfect lattice that excludes impurities and can be easily handled. To the
      best of my knowledge, almost every small-molecule API is crystallized at one
      stage or another; it\u2019s the best way to ensure that the material is extremely
      pure.</p><p>(Crystallizing proteins for administration is less common, since
      proteins are really difficult to crystallize, but it\u2019s not unheard of\u2014insulin
      is often administered subcutaneously as a <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22213\\\">microcrystalline
      suspension</a>, which allows higher concentrations to be accessed without excessive
      viscosity.)</p><p>But crystallization is also something we can\u2019t really
      control. We can\u2019t physically put molecules into a lattice or force them
      to adopt ordered configurations; all we can do is dissolve them in some mixture,
      tweak the conditions a little bit, and hope that crystals form. Thus, finding
      good crystallization conditions basically amounts to randomly screening solvents
      and additives, leaving the solutions for a long time, and checking to see if
      crystals grow. In the words of <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/voodoo-nominations\\\">Derek
      Lowe</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I'd like to open up the floor for nominations for
      the Blackest Art in All of Chemistry. And my candidate is a strong, strong contender:
      crystallization. When you go into a protein crystallography lab and see stack
      after stack after stack of plastic trays, each containing scores of different
      little wells, each with a slight variation on the conditions, you realize that
      you're looking at something that we just don't understand very well.</p></blockquote><p>Why
      does microgravity matter for crystallization? <em>Not Boring</em> says that
      crystallization occurs \u201Cat the mesoscopic scale, the length scale on which
      objects are larger than nanoscale (on the order of atoms and molecules) but
      still small enough that quantum mechanical or other non-trivial \u2018microscopic\u2019
      behavior becomes apparent.\u201D I found this answer a little confusing\u2014doesn\u2019t
      crystallization begin on the nanoscale and end on the macroscopic scale?</p><p>Clearer
      to me was the explanation from a 2001 <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cg005511b\\\">review</a>
      by Kundrot and co-workers:</p><blockquote><p>In zero gravity, a crystal is subject
      to Brownian motion as on the ground, but unlike the ground case, there is no
      acceleration inducing it to sediment <em>[fall out of solution]</em>. A growing
      crystal in zero gravity will move very little with respect to the surrounding
      fluid. Moreover, as growth units leave solution and are added to the crystal,
      a region of solution depleted in protein is formed. Usually this solution has
      a lower density than the bulk solution and will convect upward in a 1g field
      as seen by Schlerien photography (Figure 1). In zero gravity, the bouyant <em>[sic]</em>
      force is eliminated and no bouyancy-driven convection occurs. Because the positions
      of the crystal and its depletion zone are stable, the crystal can grow under
      conditions where its growing surface is in contact with a solution that is only
      slightly supersaturated. In contrast, the sedimentation and convection that
      occur under 1g place the growing crystal surface in contact with bulk solution
      that is typically several times supersaturated. Lower supersaturation at the
      growing crystal surface allows more high-energy misincorporated growth units
      to disassociate from the crystal before becoming trapped in the crystal by the
      addition of other growth units\u2026<br><br>In short, promotion of a stable
      depletion zone in microgravity is postulated to provide a better ordered crystal
      lattice and benefit the crystal growth process.</p></blockquote><p>To summarize,
      microgravity serves to immobilize the crystal with respect to the surrounding
      solution, preventing convection or sedimentation from bringing highly concentrated
      solutions into contact with the crystal. This slows crystal growth, which might
      sound bad but is actually really good: in general, the slower a crystal grows,
      the higher its purity. (See also <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav201510\\\">this
      2015 article</a> for further discussion.)</p><p>What practical impact does this
      have? In most cases, crystals grown in space are better than their terrestrial
      congeners by <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c01056\\\">a
      variety of metrics</a>: larger, structurally better, and more uniform. To quote
      from the <em>Not Boring</em> piece:</p><blockquote><p>Doing crystallization
      in space is like adding a gravity knob to your instrument\u2014it opens up regions
      of process design space that would otherwise be inaccessible. Importantly, after
      the crystallization occurs in space, the drug retains its solid state upon re-entry.
      Manufacture in space; use on earth.<br><br>This is why pharma is going to space
      to experiment with a wide range of medicines. Formulations made in microgravity
      could open the door to improvements in drug shelf life, bioavailability, IP
      expansion, and even better approaches to drug delivery\u2026<br><br>To date,
      there has been a major disconnect between microgravity research and manufacturing.
      While it\u2019s been possible to hitch a ride to the ISS and collaborate with
      NASA on PCG experiments, there is no existing commercial offering to actually
      manufacture drugs in space. Merck used their research results on Keytruda\xAE
      crystallization to tinker with their terrestrial approaches to formulation.
      What if they could actually just manufacture the crystals they discovered in
      microgravity at commercial scale?<br><br>This is Varda\u2019s mission\u2014to
      make widespread research and manufacturing in microgravity a reality.</p></blockquote><p>One
      concern I have is that to date, the vast majority of space-based crystallization
      has been aimed at structural biology (elucidating the structure of a protein
      via crystallography), which only takes one crystal, one time. What Varda is
      aiming to do is preparative crystallography: crystallizing proteins and small
      molecules to isolate large quantities of them. Both processes obviously involve
      growing crystals, but otherwise they\u2019re pretty different: in structural
      biology, all you care about is isolating a single large and very pure crystal,
      while uniformity and reproducibility are paramount in preparative crystallography.</p><p>There\u2019s
      some precedent for preparative protein crystallization in microgravity: a 1996
      Schering-Plough paper studied crystallization of zinc interferon-\u03B12b on
      the Space Shuttle. The results are excellent: over 95% of the protein crystallized,
      and the resulting suspension showed good stability and improved serum half-life
      in <em>Cynomolgus</em> monkeys (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/361/1/139/609196/Macroscale-production-and-analysis-of-crystalline?redirectedFrom=fulltext\\\">ref</a>,

      The difference in crystal quality is huge:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      under different conditions.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Of course, until
      recently access to space was very limited and there wasn\u2019t much reason
      to study preparative protein crystallography in microgravity, so the lack of
      studies is hardly surprising. For all the reasons discussed above, it seems
      very likely that preparative crystallography will be generally better in microgravity,
      and that the resulting crystals will be more homogenous and more pure than the
      crystals you could grow on Earth. But it\u2019s not 100% certain, and that\u2019s
      something Varda will have to establish. The word \u201Ccan\u201D is doing a
      lot of work in this text from their website:</p><blockquote><p>By eliminating
      factors such as natural convection and sedimentation, processing in a microgravity
      environment provides a unique path to formulating small molecules and biologics
      that traditional manufacturing processes cannot address. The resulting tunable
      particle size distributions, more ordered crystals, and new forms <strong>can</strong>
      lead to improved bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual property,
      and new routes of administration <em>(emphasis added)</em></p></blockquote><p>Another
      concern is that little work (that I\u2019m aware of) has been done on small
      molecule crystallization in microgravity\u2014the very task Varda intends to
      start with. Small molecules, in general, are much easier to crystallize than
      proteins, and there are more parameters for the experimental scientist to tune.
      While there are certainly cases where small molecule crystals can display unexpected
      or problematic behaviors (like the famous case of <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011052932607\\\">ritonavir</a>,
      the molecule Varda is investigating first), in general crystallization of small
      molecules seems like an easier problem, and one for which there are better state-of-the-art
      workarounds.</p><p>The most likely failure mode to me, though, is just that
      microgravity crystallization is better than crystallization on Earth, but not
      that much better. Shooting APIs into space, waiting for them to crystallize,
      and then launching them back to Earth is going to be really expensive, and Varda
      will have to demonstrate extraordinary results to justify the added hassle\u2014particularly
      for a technique that they hope to make a key part of the pharmaceutical manufacturing
      process. Talk about supply chain risk! (Is this all going to be <a href=\\\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmp\\\">GMP</a>?)</p><p>And
      it\u2019s worth pointing out a fairly obvious consideration too: what Varda
      is proposing to do in space is only one part of a vast, multi-step operation.
      No synthesis will take place in space, so all the manufacturing of either proteins
      or small molecules will take place on Earth. The purified products will then
      be launched into space, crystallized, and then the crystal-containing solution
      will undergo reentry and then be formulated into whatever final form the drug
      needs to be administered in.</p><p>So, although \u201Cthere are a number of
      small molecules that fetch hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per
      kg\u201D (<em>Not Boring</em>), Varda can address only a small\u2014albeit important\u2014part
      of the manufacturing process. I doubt this is likely to change. On average,
      it takes 100\u20131000 kg of raw materials to manufacture 1 kg of a small molecule
      drug (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00477\\\">ref</a>),
      so shipping everything to orbit would massively raise costs, without any obvious
      advantages that I can think of. The TAM for Varda might be large enough to break
      even, but it\u2019s not going to replace conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing
      anytime soon.</p><p>Varda\u2019s pitch is perfect for venture capital: ambitious,
      risky, and potentially game-changing if it succeeds. And I wish them luck in
      their quest, since new and better ways to approach formulation would be awesome.
      But I can\u2019t shake the nagging doubt that they\u2019re so excited about
      the image of space-based manufacturing that they\u2019re trying to invent a
      problem that their aerospace engineers have a solution for. We\u2019ll find
      out soon enough if they\u2019ve succeeded.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"Not

      easier now than it ever has been.</p><p>There are a lot of ways one could try

      could find examples closer to home.</p><h3><strong>NMR Spectroscopy</strong></h3><p>NMR
      spectroscopy is now the primary method for characterization and structural study
      of organic molecules, but it wasn\u2019t always very good. The last half-century
      has seen a <a href=\\\"https://content.iospress.com/download/biomedical-spectroscopy-and-imaging/bsi055?id=biomedical-spectroscopy-and-imaging%2Fbsi055\\\">steady
      increase</a> in the quality of NMR spectrometers (principally driven by the
      development of more powerful magnetic fields), meaning that even a relatively
      lackluster NMR facility today has equipment beyond the wildest dreams of a scientist
      in the 1980s:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link

      Available Compounds</strong></h3><p>The number of compounds available for purchase
      has markedly increased in recent years. In the 1950s, the Aldrich Chemical Company\u2019s
      listings could fit on a single page, and even by the 1970s Sigma-Aldrich only
      sold 40,000 or so chemicals (<a href=\\\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/sigma-aldrich\\\">source</a>).</p><p>But
      things have changed. Nowadays new reagents are available for purchase within
      weeks or months of being reported (<a href=\\\"https://enamine.net/news-press-releases/press-releases/1286-enamine-brings-levin-nitrogen-deleting-reagent-to-the-market\\\">e.g.</a>),
      and companies like Enamine spend all their time devising new and quirky structures
      for medicinal chemists to buy.</p><p>One way to quantify how many compounds
      are for sale today is through<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database\\\">the
      ZINC database</a>, aimed at collecting compounds for virtual screening, which
      is updated every few years or so. The first iteration of ZINC, in 2005, had
      fewer than a million compounds: now there are almost 40 billion:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      fact that it\u2019s now routine to perform conformational searches and high-accuracy
      quantum chemical calculations on catalyst\u2022substrate complexes with this
      degree of flexibility would astonish anyone from the past. (To be fair to computational
      chemists, it\u2019s not all Moore\u2019s Law\u2014advances in QM tooling also
      play a big role.)</p><h3><strong>What Now?</strong></h3><p>There are lots of
      advances that I haven\u2019t even covered, like the general improvement in synthetic
      methodology and the rise of robotics. Nevertheless, I think the trend is clear:
      it\u2019s easier to acquire data than it\u2019s ever been.</p><p>What, then,
      do we do with all this data? Most of the time, the answer seems to be \u201Cnot
      much.\u201D <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03246\\\">A
      recent editorial</a> by Marisa Kozlowski observes that the average number of
      substrates in <em>Organic Letters</em> has increased from 17 in 2009 to 40 in
      2021, even as the information contained in these papers has largely remained
      constant. Filling a substrate scope with almost identical compounds is a boring
      way to use more data; we can do better.</p><p>The availability of cheap data
      means that scientists can\u2014and must\u2014start thinking about new ways to
      approach experimental design. Lots of academic scientists still labor under
      the delusion that \u201Chypothesis-driven science\u201D is somehow superior
      to HTE, when in fact the two are ideal complements to one another. \u201CThinking
      in 96-well plates\u201D is already common in industry, and should become more
      common in academia; why run a single reaction when you can run a whole screen?</p><p>New
      tools are needed to design panels, run reactions, and analyze the resultant
      data. One nice entry into this space is Tim Cernak\u2019s <em><a href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c75166702a9bcd6918bf39\\\">phactor</a></em>,
      a software package for high-throughput experimentation, and I\u2019m sure lots
      more tools will spring up in the years to come. (I\u2019m also optimistic that
      multi-substrate screening, which we and others have used in \u201Cscreening
      for generality,\u201D will become more widely adopted as HTE becomes more commonplace.)</p><p>The
      real worry, though, is that we will refuse to change our paradigms and just
      use all these improvements to publish old-style papers faster. All the technological
      breakthroughs in the world won\u2019t do anything to accelerate scientific progress
      if we refuse to open our eyes to the possibilities they create. If present trends
      continue, it may be possible in 5\u201310 years to screen for a hit one week,
      optimize reaction conditions the next week, and run the substrate scope on the
      third week. Do we really want a world in which every methodology graduate student
      is expected to produce 10\u201312 low-quality papers per year?</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"Much

      Monkeys</em> is one of the most literary memoirs I\u2019ve read. The book itself
      is a clear homage to Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s <em>Fear and Loathing in Las
      Vegas</em>; Mart\xEDnez writes in the \u201Cgonzo journalism\u201D style, blending
      larger-than-life personal exploits with frank accounting of the facts. But Antonio
      Garc\xEDa Mart\xEDnez\u2019s writing, replete with GRE-level words and classical
      epigraphs, invites further literary comparisons.</p><h2><em><strong>Chaos Monkeys</strong></em><strong>
      as </strong><em><strong>The Odyssey</strong></em></h2><p>The first comparison
      that springs to mind is <em>The Odyssey</em>. Odysseus, the protagonist of The
      Odyssey, is frequently described as <em>polytropos</em> (lit. \u201Cmany turns\u201D),
      which denotes his wily and cunning nature. Antonio Garc\xEDa Mart\xEDnez (or,
      per the tech fondness for acronyms, \u201CAGM\u201D) certainly deserves the
      same epithet.</p><p><em>Chaos Monkeys</em> is structured as a recounting of
      AGM\u2019s escapades in Silicon Valley. In order, he (1) leaves his job at Goldman
      Sachs and joins an ad-tech company, (2) quits and founds his own company, AdGrok,
      (3) gets accepted to Y Combinator and survives a lengthy legal battle with his
      former employer, (4) sells AdGrok simultaneously to both Twitter and Facebook,
      eventually sending the other employees to Twitter and himself to Facebook, (5)
      becomes a PM at Facebook and engineers a scheme to fix their ad platform and
      make them profitable, (6) succeeds, sorta, but pisses people off and gets fired,
      and then (7) turns around and sells his expertise to Twitter.</p><p>His circuitous
      journey around the Bay Area has the rough form of an ancient epic: at each company,
      he\u2019s faced with new challenges and new adversaries, and his fractious relationships
      with his superiors mean that he\u2019s often at the mercy of capricious higher
      powers, not unlike Odysseus. Nevertheless, through a mixture of cunning and
      hard work he manages to escape with his skin intact every time, ready for the
      next episode. (And, best of all, he literally lives on a boat while working
      at Facebook.)</p><p>(His escapades have only continued since this book was published:
      he got hired at Apple, unceremoniously fired a few weeks later [for passages
      in <em>Chaos Monkeys</em>], made it on <a href=\\\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2JMZ0yOuTaGU3bXLymlWYT\\\">Joe
      Rogan</a>, and has now founded <a href=\\\"https://www.spindl.xyz/\\\">spindl</a>,
      a web3 ad-tech startup, while simultaneously <a href=\\\"https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/why-judaism\\\">converting
      to Judaism</a>.)</p><h2><em><strong>Chaos Monkeys</strong></em><strong> as </strong><em><strong>Moby-Dick</strong></em></h2><p><em>Chaos
      Monkeys</em> bears a structural resemblance to <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Narrative
      passages alternate with lengthy technical discussions about the minutiae of
      Silicon Valley: one chapter, you\u2019re reading about how AGM flooded Mark
      Zuckerberg\u2019s office trying to brew beer inside Facebook, while the next
      chapter is devoted to a discussion of how demand-side advertising platforms
      work.</p><p>The similarities run deeper, though. Venture capitalism, the funding
      model that dominates Silicon Valley, was originally developed to fund whaling
      expeditions in the 1800s (<a href=\\\"https://newrepublic.com/article/154490/small-world-vc\\\">ref</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43322\\\">ref</a>).
      While once venture capitalists listened to prospective whaling captains advertising
      the quality of their crews in a New England tavern, today VCs hear pitches from
      thousands of startups hoping to develop <s>the next killer app</s> the best
      ChatGPT frontend and make millions.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a coincidence: whaling
      expeditions and tech startups are both high-risk, high-reward enterprises that
      require an incredible amount of skill and hard work, but also a healthy dose
      of luck. Both operations have returns dominated by outliers, making picking
      winners much more important than making safe bets, and in both cases the investment
      remains illiquid for a long time, demanding trust from the investor.</p><p>Much
      like Ishmael in <em>Moby-Dick</em>, AGM\u2019s adventures see him join forces
      with a motley crew of high-performing misfits from around the globe. And just
      as Ahab\u2019s quest for the whale is foreshadowed to be a ruinous one, so too
      does the reader quickly come to understand that AGM\u2019s tenure in Silicon
      Valley will not, ultimately, end well. A fatalistic haze hangs over the book,
      coloring his various hijinks with a sense of impending loss.</p><p>(And did
      I mention he lives on a boat?)</p><h2><em><strong>Chaos Monkeys</strong></em><strong>
      as </strong><em><strong>The Great Gatsby</strong></em></h2><p>The emotional
      tone of the book, however, is best compared to that favorite of high-school
      English classes, <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. AGM, like Nick Carraway, is an outsider
      in the world of the nouveau riche\u2014opulent parties, high-speed road races,
      conspicuous consumption\u2014and, over the course of the book, is alternately
      infatuated with and disgusted by his surroundings. When at last AGM retires
      to a quiet life on <s>Ithaca</s> the San Juan islands, it\u2019s with feelings
      of disillusionment, betrayal, and frustration, not unlike Carraway withdrawing
      to the Midwest. As AGM writes in the penultimate paragraph of <em>Chaos Monkeys</em>\u2019s
      acknowledgements:</p><blockquote><p>To Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Sam
      Altman, and the rest of the Y Combinator partners and founders involved in the
      AdGrok saga. In a Valley world awash with mammoth greed and opportunism masquerading
      as beneficent innovation, you were the only real loyalty and idealism I ever
      encountered.</p></blockquote><p>But <em>Chaos Monkeys</em> isn\u2019t solely
      an indictment of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst excesses. Not unlike <em>The Wire</em>,
      <em>Chaos Monkeys</em> manages to simultaneously portray the positive and negative
      aspects of its subject matter, refusing to be reduced to \u201Ctech good\u201D
      or \u201Ctech bad.\u201D The panoply of grifters, Dilbert-tier bosses, and Machiavellian
      sociopaths lambasted by AGM can exist only because of the immense value that
      their enterprises provide to society\u2014and his faith in the ability of tech
      to create wonders persists even as his own efforts to do so are undermined.</p><p>So
      the underlying message of <em>Chaos Monkeys</em>, ultimately, is one of hope
      for tech. If the excesses of tech are worse than other industries, it's only
      because the underlying field itself is so much more fertile. Far from condemning
      it, the depths of the decadence spawned by Silicon Valley bear witness to the
      immense value it creates. Imitation is the highest form of flattery; grift is
      the surest sign of productivity.</p><p>Overall, <em>Chaos Monkeys</em> is an
      exhilarating and hilarious read, a gentle introduction to the world of term
      sheets, product managers, and non-competes, and a book replete with anecdotes
      sure to fulfill the stereotypes of tech-lovers and tech-haters alike.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"Recently,

      journals taking a much bigger role as editors and custodians of science, using
      their power to shape the way that science is conducted and exerting control
      over the scientific process.</p><p>I was thus intrigued when, last week, <em>The
      Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</em> (<em>JCIM</em>; an ACS journal)
      released <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00599\\\">a
      set of guidelines</a> for molecular dynamics simulations that future publications
      must comply with. These guidelines <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen/status/1659889905843990529\\\">provoked
      a reaction from the community</a>: various provisions (like the requirement
      that all simulations be performed in triplicate) were alleged to be <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/PabloGalazDavis/status/1659940766330781696\\\">arbitrary</a>
      or <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/PiiaBartos/status/1659976208015130626\\\">unscientific</a>,
      and the fact that these standards were imposed by editors and not determined
      by the community also <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/daviddesancho/status/1660184730862583808\\\">drew
      criticism</a>.</p><p>The authors <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/RommieAmaro/status/1660050832157716481\\\">say</a>
      that the editorial \u201Cis *not* intended to instruct on how to run MD\u201D,
      but this defense rings hollow to me. See, for instance, the section about choosing
      force fields:</p><blockquote><p>JCIM will not accept simulations with old force
      field versions unless a clear justification is provided. Specialized force fields
      should be used when available (e.g., for intrinsically disordered proteins).
      In the case of the reparametrization or development of new parameters compatible
      with a given force field, please provide benchmark data to support the actual
      need for reparameterization, proper validation of novel parameters against experimental
      or high-level QM data\u2026</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not a molecular dynamics
      expert, so I\u2019m happy to stay out of the scientific side of things (although
      the editorial\u2019s claim that \u201CMD simulations are not suitable to sample
      events occurring between free energy barriers\u201D seems clearly false for
      sufficiently low-barrier processes). Nor do I wish to overstate the size of
      the community\u2019s reaction: a few people complaining on Twitter doesn\u2019t
      really matter.</p><p>Rather, I want to use this vignette to reflect on the nature
      of scientific authority, and return to a piece I\u2019ve cited <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html\\\">before</a>:
      Geoff Anders\u2019 <a href=\\\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/\\\">\u201CThe
      Transformations of Science.\u201D</a> Anders describes how the enterprise of
      science, initially intended to be free from authority, has evolved into a magisterium
      of knowledge that governments, corporations, and laypeople rely upon:</p><blockquote><p>The
      original ideal of <em>nullius in verba</em> sometimes leads people to say that
      science is a never-ending exploration, never certain, and hence antithetical
      to claims on the basis of authority. This emphasizes one aspect of science,
      and indeed in theory any part of the scientific corpus could be overturned by
      further observations.<br><br>There is, however, another part of science\u2014<em>settled
      science.</em> Settled science is safe to rely on, at least for now. Calling
      it into question should not be at the top of our priorities, and grant committees,
      for example, should typically not give money to researchers who want to question
      it again.</p></blockquote><p>While each of these forms of science is fine on
      its own, they ought not to be conflated:</p><blockquote><p>When scientists are
      meant to be authoritative, they\u2019re supposed to know the answer. When they\u2019re
      exploring, it\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t. Hence, encouraging scientists
      to reach authoritative conclusions prematurely may undermine their ability to
      explore\u2014thereby yielding scientific slowdown. Such a dynamic may be difficult
      to detect, since the people who are supposed to detect it might themselves be
      wrapped up in a premature authoritative consensus.</p></blockquote><p>This is
      tough, because scientists like settled science. We write grant applications
      describing how our research will bring clarity to long-misunderstood areas of
      reality, and fancy ourselves explorers of unknown intellectual realms. How disappointing,
      then, that so often science can only be relied upon when it settles, long after
      the original discoveries have been made! An intriguing experimental result might
      provoke further study, but it\u2019s still \u201Cin beta\u201D (to borrow the
      software expression) for years or decades, possibly even forever.</p><p>Applying
      the settled/unsettled framework of science to the <em>JCIM</em> question brings
      some clarity. I don\u2019t think anyone would complain about settled science
      being used in editorial guidelines: I wouldn\u2019t want to open <em>JACS</em>
      and read a paper that questioned the existence of electrons, any more than I
      want <em>The Economist</em> to publish articles suggesting that Switzerland
      is an elaborate hoax.</p><p>Scientific areas of active inquiry, however, are
      a different matter. Molecular dynamics might be a decades-old field, but the
      very existence of journals like <em>JCIM</em> and <em>JCTC</em> points to its
      unsettled nature\u2014and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen/status/1659931209659457539\\\">AlphaFold2</a>,
      discussed in the editorial, is barely older than my toddler. There are whole
      hosts of people trying to figure out how to run the best MD simulations, and
      editors giving them additional guidelines is unlikely to accelerate this process.
      (This is separate from mandating they report what they actually did, which is
      fair for a journal to require.)</p><p>Scientists, especially editors confronted
      with an unending torrent of low-quality work, want to combat bad science. This
      is a good instinct. And I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that journals need
      to become something more than a neutral forum in the Internet age\u2014the editorial
      angle of journals, at present, seems underutilized. But prematurely trying to
      dictate rules for exploring the frontier of human knowledge is, in my opinion,
      the wrong way to do this. What if the rules are wrong?</p><p>There may be a
      time when it\u2019s prudent for editors to make controversial or unpopular decisions:
      demanding pre-registration in psychology, for instance, or mandating external
      validation of a new synthetic method. But I\u2019m not sure that \u201Chow many
      replicates MD simulations need\u201D is the hill I would choose to die on. In
      an age of declining journal relevance, wise editorial decisions might be able
      to set journals apart from the \u201Canarchic preprint lake\u201D\u2014but poor
      decisions may simply hasten their decline into irrelevance.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"Previously,

      anything concrete about him before I started reading this book.</p><p>His brief
      biography is as follows: Richard Hamming (1915\u20131998) studied mathematics
      at the University of Chicago, earned a PhD in three years from Illinois, and
      then started as a professor at the University of Louisville\u2026 in 1944. He
      was almost immediately recruited for the Manhattan Project, where he worked
      on large-scale simulations of imploding spherical shells of explosives, and
      generally acted as a \u201Ccomputational janitor\u201D for various projects.</p><p>In
      1946, he moved to Bell Telephone Laboratories, <a href=\\\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review\\\">\u201Carguably
      the most innovative research institution in the country,\u201D</a> and worked
      there until 1976. During his time at Bell Labs, he was involved in \u201Cnearly
      all of the laboratories' most prominent achievements\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming\\\">Wikipedia</a>),
      and was rewarded with such accolades as the third-ever Turing Award (essentially
      the Nobel Prize for computer science) and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming medal.
      (You know you\u2019re successful when someone else names an award after you!)</p><p>After
      he retired from Bell Labs, Hamming went on to go teach classes at the Naval
      Postgraduate School. This book\u2014published in 1996, just before his death\u2014is
      based on the capstone engineering class he taught there, which attempted to
      prepare students for their technical future by conveying the \u201Cstyle of
      thinking\u201D necessary to be a great scientist and engineer. Stripe Press
      calls it \u201Ca provocative challenge to anyone who wants to build something
      great\u201D and \u201Ca manual of style for how to get there,\u201D while the
      foreword calls it a \u201Ctour of scientific greatness\u201D which prepares
      \u201Cthe next generation for even greater greatness\u201D while challenging
      them to serve the public good.</p><p>I was excited to read this book because:</p><ol><li><p>Hamming
      was present at arguably the two most successful scientific institutions of the
      20th century\u2014the Manhattan Project and Bell Labs\u2014and so was witness
      to more innovative scientific discoveries than almost anyone today. So if anyone
      has a shot at teaching how to be an effective scientist, it\u2019s Hamming.</p></li><li><p>The
      interface between academic science and real-world advances seems to be one of
      the most broken elements of the modern research ecosystem, and I was interested
      to see what Hamming, as a self-proclaimed scientist and engineer, had to say
      on the subject.</p></li><li><p>It\u2019s a first-hand account of the creation
      of the most important field of the past century\u2014computer science\u2014and
      thus a way to witness, albeit second-hand, the important process of <a href=\\\"https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/when-do-ideas-get-easier-to-find\\\">scientific
      branch-creation</a>.</p></li><li><p>The book is a chance to see computing, and
      computer science, as it was before the implications and importance of the field
      became obvious, and thus a way to understand what a promising area of research
      looks like without the benefit of hindsight.</p></li><li><p>This is a chance
      to read frank and honest reflections from someone who both was a great scientist
      and was adjacent to a huge number of other great scientists, and thus learn
      about the culture of successful science (especially successful science in the
      mid-20th century, which might be different than the science of today).</p></li></ol><h2><strong>1.
      What\u2019s In The Book?</strong></h2><p><em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em>
      is not a conventional textbook, but neither is it a self-help book, a memoir,
      or a guide to personal strategy. The two books that remind me of it most are
      <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em>, by Douglas Hofstadter, and <em>Zero To One</em>,
      by Peter Thiel. All three books are composed of various pseudo-independent chapters
      which, in isolation, could likely function as essays, but which echo certain
      themes over and over again in a way that makes the whole greater than the sum
      of its parts in a hard-to-summarize way.</p><p>Hamming\u2019s goal in structuring
      the book this way is clear, and explicitly stated: he doesn\u2019t want to teach
      object-level facts, because the facts needed to succeed in any discipline will
      inevitably change over the course of time. Instead he seeks to teach the patterns
      of thought which will enable anyone to succeed in an evolving technical landscape.
      To do so, he uses a mix of first-person stories, historical reflections, mathematical
      proofs, and graphs, all with the goal of teaching something that\u2019s essentially
      incommunicable: style. I quote:</p><blockquote><p>I will show you my style as
      best I can, but, again, you must take those elements of it which seem to fit
      you, and you must finally create your own style. Either you will be a leader
      or a follower, and my goal for you is to be a leader. You cannot adopt every
      trait I discuss in what I have observed in myself and others; you must select
      and adapt, and make them your own if the course is to be effective.</p></blockquote><p>Despite
      Hamming\u2019s insistence that there is \u201Creally no technical content\u201D
      in the book and that any mathematics is only \u201Cwindow dressing,\u201D I
      found that my lack of background knowledge made several chapters\u2014particularly
      those on digital filters\u2014quite difficult to understand.</p><h2><strong>2.
      Representative Anecdotes</strong></h2><p>In keeping with Hamming\u2019s desire
      to convey the \u201Cstyle of thinking\u201D rather than actual object-level
      scientific ideas, I\u2019ll share a few anecdotes, insights, and quotes in an
      attempt to reproduce the style of his writing.</p><h3><strong>2.1 The Second
      Mouse Gets The Cheese</strong></h3><p>Hamming recounts the invention of interpreters
      and compilers and then reflects on how hard it was for early computer pioneers
      to think of computers as \u201Csymbol manipulators and not just number crunchers,\u201D
      observing that often the first people in a field do not understand it as well
      as those who come after them. Why is this?</p><blockquote><p>The reason this
      happens is that the creators have to fight through so many dark difficulties,
      and wade through so much misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the
      light as others can, now the door is open and the path made easy\u2026. in time
      the same will probably be true of you.</p></blockquote><p>This is a nice observation,
      and perhaps explains the value of startups: incumbents in a market can be inefficient
      not only for bureaucratic reasons, but also because they\u2019re intellectually
      less suited to see new opportunities\u2014the young can see the status quo more
      clearly than those who\u2019ve had to create it. This also explains why \u201Creally
      new ideas seldom arise from the experts in the field\u201D\u2014experts always
      bring their expertise when looking at something new, which makes them more likely
      to be correct, but also disincentivizes new ways of thinking and thus creates
      a sort of status quo bias.</p><h3><strong>2.2 Order-of-Magnitude Changes</strong></h3><p>Many
      people, faced with early computers, dismissed them as simply a faster way to
      do rote calculations\u2014which seems silly in hindsight, but was a real barrier
      for early computer pioneers to overcome. Hamming argues \u201Ca single order
      of magnitude change (a factor of ten) produces fundamentally new effects\u201D
      in any piece of technology, and immediately thereafter reflects on how it\u2019s
      difficult for people to accept something new:</p><blockquote><p>People always
      want to think that something new is just like the past\u2014they like to be
      comfortable in their minds as well as their bodies\u2014and hence they prevent
      themselves from making any significant contribution to the new field being created
      under their noses. Not everything which is said to be new really is new, and
      it is hard to decide in some cases when something is new, yet the all too common
      reaction of \u201Cit\u2019s nothing new\u201D is stupid.</p></blockquote><p>I
      had previously attributed the idea that ten-fold improvement creates a fundamentally
      new product to Peter Thiel (<em>Zero To One</em>, pp. 48\u201349), but it seems
      Hamming (as usual) got there first.</p><h3><strong>2.3 Intuition In High Dimensions</strong></h3><p>Since
      most complex problems occur in high-dimensional spaces, Hamming illustrates
      a few ways that our 2D or 3D intuition can fail us.</p><p>One particularly nice
      thought experiment is this: take a square with side length 4 and divide it into
      four squares, each containing a unit circle. Now draw a circle in the middle
      of the square, such that the circle just touches each of the four unit circles.
      Realizing that the distance from the center of this circle to the center of
      each unit circle must be \u221A2, and that the radius of the unit circle is,
      of course, 1, we can see that the radius of the inner circle must be \u221A2
      - 1 \u2248 0.414.</p><p>Now, we can perform the same mental exercise for a cube
      with side length four, and find that the analogous inner sphere has side length
      \u221A3 - 1 \u2248 0.732. More generally, as we extend this exercise to higher
      dimensions, we find that the radius of the inner <em>n</em>-dimensional hypersphere
      is \u221A<em>n</em> - 1, which is bizarre! For instance, in ten dimensions,
      the inner sphere has radius \u221A10 - 1 \u2248 2.162, meaning that it reaches
      outside of the surrounding cube:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, the sphere is convex,
      yes it touches each of the 1,024 packed spheres on the inside, yet it reaches
      outside the cube! So much for your raw intuition about n-dimensional space,
      but remember the n-dimensional space is where the design of complex objects
      generally takes place.</p></blockquote><p>This sort of intuition is difficult
      to obtain, but Hamming gives a few examples. One that stuck with me was the
      claim that, in high-dimensional shapes, almost all of the volume is on the surface\u2014so
      \u201Calmost surely the optimal design will be on the surface and will not be
      inside, as you might think from taking the calculus and doing optimizations
      in that course.\u201D</p><h3><strong>2.4 The Fast Fourier Transform</strong></h3><p>Here\u2019s
      a memorable story from Hamming\u2019s life:</p><blockquote><p>You have all heard
      about the fast Fourier transform [FFT] and the Tukey-Cooley paper. It is sometimes
      called the <em>Tukey-Cooley</em> transform or algorithm. Tukey had suggested
      to me, sort of, the basic ideas of the FFT. I had at the time an IBM Card Programmed
      Calculator (CPC) and the \u201Cbutterfly\u201D operation meant it was completely
      impractical to do with the equipment I had. Some years later I had an internally
      programmed IBM 650 and he remarked on it again. All I remembered was that it
      was one of Tukey\u2019s few bad ideas; I completely forgot why it was bad\u2014namely
      because of the equipment I had at the time. So I did not do the FFT, though
      a book I had already published (1961) shows I knew all the facts necessary,
      and could have done it easily!<br><br>Moral: when you know something cannot
      be done, also remember the essential reason why, so later, when the circumstances
      have changed, you will not say \u201CIt can\u2019t be done.\u201D Think of my
      error! How much more stupid can anyone be?</p></blockquote><p>Later in the book,
      Hamming puts forward the following \u201Cold statement\u201D about experts:</p><blockquote><p>If
      an expert says something can be done he is probably correct, but if he says
      it is impossible then consider getting another opinion.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>2.5
      The Mixed Blessings of Jargon</strong></h3><p>Hamming emphasizes the importance,
      as an interdisciplinary scientist, of mastering the language of the field in
      which you\u2019re working, but warns against embracing jargon too much. Why?
      Jargon serves \u201Cto facilitate communication over a restricted area of things
      or events\u2026 [but] also blocks thinking outside the original area it was
      designed to cover.\u201D So jargon makes intra-domain communication easier,
      but makes inter-domain communication harder.</p><p>More philosophically, jargon
      is a consequence of how \u201Cwe have been mainly selected by evolution to resent
      outsiders,\u201D and thus the \u201Cinstinctive use of jargon\u201D is a base
      instinct that must be consciously resisted.</p><h3><strong>2.6 Optimal Components,
      Suboptimal Systems</strong></h3><p>Hamming discusses the field of systems engineering,
      which he defines as \u201Cthe attempt to keep at all times the larger goals
      in mind and to translate local actions into global results\u201D (emphasis original),
      and coins the first rule of systems engineering:</p><blockquote><p>If you optimize
      the components, you will probably ruin the system performance.</p></blockquote><p>This
      point is illustrated with a few examples. One of these examples is the progressive
      optimization of calculus and linear algebra classes in college, where \u201Cwe
      have stripped out anything not immediately relevant to each course,\u201D leading
      to \u201Clarge parts of any mathematical education being omitted in the urge
      to optimize the individual courses.\u201D Only when the proper goal of a mathematical
      education is taken into account\u2014producing well-trained students with a
      firm grasp of math and the ability to apply it to important problems\u2014can
      the constituent courses sanely be optimized.</p><p>I found this idea pretty
      insightful, and have thought about it a lot since reading this book. For instance,
      one can see many researchers as over-optimizing for \u201Cpublishing papers\u201D
      or \u201Cwinning grants\u201D rather than working towards maximizing total scientific
      progress. (Alex Danco has a great piece discussing the same ideas in the context
      of the Canadian tech ecosystem, which I wrote about <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221206_definite_games_indefinite_optimism.html\\\">here</a>.)</p><h3><strong>2.7
      Learning Should Be Difficult</strong></h3><p>I like this story so much I\u2019ll
      just reproduce it in its entirety:</p><blockquote><p>When I first came to the
      Naval Postgraduate School in 1976 there was a nice dean of the extension division
      concerned with education. In some hot discussions on education we differed.
      One day I came into his office and said I was teaching a weightlifting class
      (which he knew I was not). I went on to say that graduation was lifting 250
      pounds, and I had found many students got discouraged and dropped out, some
      repeated the course, and a very few graduated. I went on to say thinking this
      over last night I decided the problem could be easily cured by simply cutting
      the weights in half\u2014the student in order to graduate, would lift 125 pounds,
      set them down, and then lift the other 125 pounds, thus lifting the 250 pounds.<br><br>I
      waited a moment while he smiled (as you probably have) and I then observed that
      when I found a simpler proof for a theorem in mathematics and used it in class,
      was I or was I not cutting the weights in half? What is your answer? Is there
      not an element of truth in the observation that the easier we make the learning
      for the student, the more we are cutting the weights in half?</p></blockquote><p>This
      story reflects a key belief of Hamming\u2019s: that creativity and talent in
      technical disciplines are not innate traits given only to rare geniuses, but
      trainable skills which anyone can hope to acquire and improve at, given the
      appropriate training regimen. In Hamming\u2019s worldview, staring at a confusing
      math problem is not a sign that you\u2019re a failure, but the process by which
      you become successful.</p><h3><strong>2.8 The Importance of Presentation</strong></h3><p>Hamming
      emphasizes that being able to \u201Csell\u201D one\u2019s ideas is a key part
      of being a scientist:</p><blockquote><p>All [methods of conveying ideas] are
      essential\u2014you must learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by
      force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists
      and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully
      presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because
      it was not well presented the first time, years before! New ideas are automatically
      resisted by the establishment, and to some extent justly. The organization cannot
      be in a continual state of ferment and change, but it should respond to significant
      changes.</p></blockquote><p>In this view, a certain degree of institutional
      conservatism is necessary to avoid being swept up by any new fad (in machine
      learning terms, we might say that organizations need to limit their learning
      rate), and so you alone must convince your peers that your insights are the
      real deal and deserve to be taken seriously.</p><p>Hamming then extends this
      idea to needing to sell your abilities more broadly:</p><blockquote><p>You do
      not hire a plumber to learn plumbing while trying to fix your trouble; you expect
      he is already an expert. Similarly, only when you have developed your abilities
      will you generally get the freedom to practice your expertise, whatever you
      choose to make it, including the expertise of \u201Cuniversality,\u201D as I
      did.</p></blockquote><p>My experience within science is that most people are
      a bit allergic to the idea of \u201Cselling\u201D themselves or their research\u2014with
      the exception of a few people who become almost addicted to it. Hamming (who
      never shies away from quoting a Greek philosopher) would probably think that
      there\u2019s an Aristotelian mean between these two extremes: the ideal scientist/engineer
      recognizes that self-promotion is a necessary means to an end, but never engages
      in self-promotion absent a higher goal.</p><h2><strong>3. Overall Themes</strong></h2><p>I
      would summarize Hamming\u2019s key themes\u2014those leitmotifs which pop up
      time and time again in the book\u2014as the following:</p><h3><strong>3.1 Fundamentals
      Are Key</strong></h3><p>Wherever possible, try to understand the intellectual
      underpinnings of a field as well as possible, rather than the surface-level
      results. If you do so, you will not only understand the field better than most
      of its practitioners, but also be better at transferring knowledge between fields.
      Perceiving \u201Cthe essential unity of all knowledge rather than the fragments
      which appear as the individual topics are taught\u201D allows one to quickly
      access relevant information to the problem at hand, no matter the field of origin.</p><p>Hamming
      frequently points out the failings of domain experts to perceive the fundamental
      underpinnings of their knowledge:</p><blockquote><p>Lo and behold, the famous
      <em>transfer function</em> is exactly the <em>eigenvalues</em> of the corresponding
      eigenfunctions! Upon asking various electrical engineers what the transfer function
      was, no one has ever told me that! Yes, when pointed out to them that it is
      the same idea they have to agree, but the fact it is the same idea never seemed
      to have crossed their minds! The same, simple idea, in two or more different
      disguises in their minds, and they knew of no connection between them! Get down
      to the basics every time! <em>(emphasis original)</em></p></blockquote><p>Not
      only is a good grasp of fundamentals important for understanding your own domain,
      it also helps with creativity. Hamming argues that creative insights come from
      the subconscious, and that \u201Cflexible access to pieces of knowledge\u201D
      is the most important way to give the subconscious the tools it needs to solve
      a problem. This flexible access arises from \u201Clooking at knowledge while
      you are acquiring it from many different angles,\u201D making sure to capture
      its key features rather than simply memorizing the aspect relevant to the task
      at hand.</p><p>(The idea that creativity comes from the subconscious is pretty
      common\u2014see, for instance, Nisbett and Wallace\u2019s article <a href=\\\"https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/nisbett%20saying%20more.pdf\\\">\u201CTelling
      More Than We Can Know,\u201D</a> which argues that basically all higher order
      cognitive processes are subconscious.)</p><h3><strong>3.2 Gain Insight Where
      Possible</strong></h3><p>No matter the task at hand, Hamming argues that the
      correct immediate step is always to gain insight about the situation, and then
      go from there. He uses the example of Planck and the \u201Cultraviolet catastrophe\u201D
      to illustrate how crucial insight can be:</p><blockquote><p>Max Planck (1858\u20131947)
      fit the black-body radiation experimental data with an empirical curve, and
      it fit so well he \u201Cknew\u201D it was \u201Cthe right formula.\u201D He
      set out to derive it, but had trouble. Finally he used a standard method of
      breaking up the energy into finite sizes and then going to the limit\u2026 Fortunately
      for Planck the formula fit only so long as he avoided the limit, and no matter
      how he took the limit the formula disappeared. He finally, being a very good,
      honest physicist, decided he had to stop short of the limit, and that is what
      defines Planck\u2019s constant!<br><br><em>[another historical paragraph omitted]</em><br><br>Before
      going on, let me discuss how this piece of history has affected my behavior
      in science. Clearly Planck was led to create the theory because the approximating
      curve fit so well, and had the proper form. I reasoned, therefore, if I were
      to help anyone do a similar thing, I had better represent things in terms of
      functions they believed would be proper for their field rather than in the standard
      polynomials. I therefore abandoned the standard polynomial approach to approximation,
      which numerical analysts and statisticians among others use most of the time,
      for the harder approach of finding which class of functions I should use.</p></blockquote><p>This
      episode demonstrates how insight can arise from a simulation, and enable future
      work (like, in this case, all of quantum mechanics), and also illustrates how
      the manner in which one performs simulations can make it either easier or harder
      to obtain underlying insights about the problem. Hamming emphasizes this point
      with a few stories from his time at Bell Labs, and argues that there are times
      where more computational power is actually counterproductive:</p><blockquote><p>I
      have often wondered what would have happened [in the Nike guided missile project]
      if I had had a modern, high-speed computer. Would I ever have acquired the feeling
      for the missile, upon which so much depended in the final design? I often doubt
      hundreds more trajectories would have taught me as much\u2014I simply do not
      know. But that is why <em>I am suspicious, to this day, of getting too many
      solutions and not doing enough very careful thinking about what you have seen.</em>
      Volume output seems to me to be a poor substitute for acquiring an intimate
      feeling for the situation being simulated\u2026 doing simple simulations at
      the early stages lets you get insights into the whole system which would be
      disguised in any full-scale simulation. <em>(emphasis original)</em></p></blockquote><p>This
      point\u2014that simulation is not the same as understanding\u2014is not unique
      to Hamming (see <em>inter alia</em> Roald Hoffmann on the subject: <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201902527\\\">1</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910283\\\">2</a>,
      <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910285\\\">3</a>),
      but hearing this from the father of scientific simulation certainly drives the
      message home!</p><h3><strong>3.3 Vision Matters</strong></h3><p>Hamming goes
      to great lengths to emphasize the importance of having a vision for your life:</p><blockquote><p>It
      is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent
      random steps will, on the average, end up about \u221A<em>n</em> steps from
      the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will
      tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to <em>n</em>.
      In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with
      vision will get you a distance proportional to <em>n</em>, while no vision will
      get you only the distance \u221A<em>n</em>. In a sense, the main difference
      between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and
      the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they
      happen\u2026 having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the
      followers.</p></blockquote><p>This theme permeates his discussion of systems
      engineering: a successful systems engineer must, at all times, keep the overall
      vision and purpose of the system in mind, so as to optimize in the right direction.
      It also motivates what problems you must choose:</p><blockquote><p>If you do
      not work on important problems, how can you expect to do important work? Yet
      direct observation and direct questioning of people show most scientists spend
      most of their time working on things they believe are not important and are
      not likely to lead to important things.</p></blockquote><p>In Hamming\u2019s
      view, it seems the precise vision one follows is less important than the simple
      act of having a vision at all. Forcing oneself to decide on goals and then strive
      to fulfill them will naturally lead you to excellence, even if the goals you
      choose aren\u2019t the same as the one Hamming would have chosen:</p><blockquote><p>The
      chief gain is in the effort to change yourself, in the struggle with yourself,
      and it is less in the winning than you might expect. Yes, it is nice to end
      up where you wanted to be, but the person you are when you get there is far
      more important. I believe a life in which you do not try to extend yourself
      regularly is not worth living\u2014but it is up to you to pick the goals you
      believe are worth striving for.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>4. Should You Read
      This Book?</strong></h2><p>I began this book review by claiming that <em>The
      Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em> isn\u2019t a textbook, or a self-help
      book, or a memoir, but failed to offer a positive vision of what it was. I now
      reveal my true opinion: <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em> is
      best viewed as a modern example of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature\\\">\u201Cwisdom
      literature,\u201D</a> in the style of ancient scriptures.</p><p>Why is this?
      Wisdom literature frequently has the curious property that it\u2019s accessible
      only to the wise. For instance, the book of Proverbs is ostensibly written to
      convey wisdom to those who seek it, but this hardly seems compatible with the
      following passage (Proverbs 26:7\u20139):</p><blockquote><p>Like a lame man's
      legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools.<br>Like one who
      binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool.<br>Like a thorn
      that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p></blockquote><p>If
      proverbs are useless\u2014or worse than useless, a thorn in the hand of a drunkard\u2014to
      those without wisdom, then what is the point of proverbs? If only the wise can
      understand your book of wisdom, why bother writing it at all?</p><p>There are
      several ways to resolve this tension (one being \u201Cthe book of Proverbs is
      stupid\u201D), but I think the right answer goes something like this: wisdom
      is accessible to those who seek it, but simply reading through a book of wisdom
      isn\u2019t sufficient to make one wise. Rather, the search for wisdom requires
      discipline and vigilance\u2014one must meditate on wise sayings, appreciate
      the underlying principles, and learn to discern what\u2019s right even in complicated
      circumstances. So, wisdom literature can help us on the journey to wisdom, but
      ultimately we will have to take the intellectual burden upon ourselves if we
      hope to get anywhere. (This is roughly how <a href=\\\"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-discoveries-begin-as-problems\\\">John
      Piper interprets Proverbs</a>.)</p><p>Viewing Hamming\u2019s book as essentially
      modern wisdom literature makes sense of his focus on the \u201Cstyle\u201D of
      thinking, his insistence that the reader must rediscover much of what he\u2019s
      saying for themselves, and his admonitions not to accept what he\u2019s saying
      blindly but to think it over at length:</p><blockquote><p>You the reader should
      take your own opinions and try first to express them clearly, and then examine
      them with counterarguments, back and forth, until <em>you are fairly clear as
      to what you believe and why you believe it</em>. It is none of the author\u2019s
      business in this matter what you believe, but it is the author\u2019s business
      to get you to think and articulate your position clearly. <em>(emphasis original)</em></p></blockquote><p>If
      we view this book\u2014Hamming\u2019s guide to future scientists and engineers,
      his <em>magnum opus</em> as a teacher and mentor\u2014as wisdom literature,
      it implies that wisdom, not any specific technical skill, is rate-limiting for
      technical progress. This is very encouraging, because wisdom, unlike innate
      intelligence, is an acquired trait, and one which we can all cultivate in ourselves.
      We can\u2019t all be Ramanujan or von Neumann, but (at least as Hamming tells
      it) we can all be Hamming.</p><p>Thus far, I\u2019ve mostly given reasons why
      you should read this book. Why shouldn\u2019t you read this book? One reason
      is that this book is aimed at scientists and engineers, and furthermore it seems
      primarily aimed at people with an interest in the \u201Chard\u201D sciences\u2014much
      of the advice assumes some contact with simulation, math, or physics. So a reader
      without at least a glancing interest in these topics might struggle to find
      some of the content relevant. (But maybe the act of extending his advice to
      other domains would prompt deeper consideration of the fundamental principles
      at play, and thus serve to cultivate wisdom!)</p><p>Another reason you shouldn\u2019t
      read this book is that it\u2019s very much framed as a personal guide\u2014it
      addresses the needs of an individual scientist, not ideas for how science writ
      large could be improved. So aspiring metascientists might be disappointed by
      Hamming\u2019s perspective; he dedicates a lot of time to thinking about how
      one can navigate imperfect organizations, and much less time to thinking about
      what a perfect organization would look like.</p><p>The strongest reason for
      reading this book, though, is that the world Hamming hopes to write for is almost
      exactly our world today. Hamming anticipates \u201Cthe inevitable and extensive
      computerization of your organization and society generally,\u201D a world in
      which scientists are frequently overwhelmed by the \u201Crate of innovation
      and change of the dominant paradigm,\u201D and a world where there is \u201Cnot
      time to allow us the leisure which comes from separating the two fields\u201D
      of science and engineering. From my perspective, this almost perfectly captures
      the feeling of working in science or tech today.</p><p>And so Hamming\u2019s
      message\u2014the vision of scientists \u201Ctrying to achieve excellence\u201D
      through making \u201Csignificant contributions to humanity\u201D on important
      problems\u2014seems more relevant today than ever. If you yourself work in a
      scientific field, and want to know how to have the greatest positive impact
      on your own character and on society, then Hamming\u2019s wisdom is for you:
      but not without some struggle</p><p><em>A transcript of Hamming\u2019s talk

      wrote</a> about kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), probably my favorite way to
      study the mechanism of organic reactions. To summarize at a high level: if the
      bonding around a given atom changes over the course of a reaction, then different
      isotopes of that atom will react at different rates. The exact magnitude of
      the effect depends on the vibrational modes involved, but is often quite different
      for different mechanisms, meaning that you can computationally predict isotope
      effects for a lot of mechanisms and then use KIE measurements to figure out
      which one is actually happening.</p><p>The trouble is that the magnitude of
      the effect depends on the difference in the mass of the two isotopologues. <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>2</sup>H
      isotope effects are quite large: H reacts up to 7x faster than D (more for mechanisms
      that involve quantum tunneling), meaning that it\u2019s not too hard to measure
      the value accurately. But as the atom gets heavier, the effects get smaller.
      For the next most common pair of isotopomers,<sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C,
      the effect is usually 5% or less.</p><p>Small KIEs are usually measured by one-pot
      competition experiments: a mixture of the two isomers is reacted to partial
      conversion, and then the isotopic composition of either the starting material
      or the product is determined. The product will be enriched in the isotope that
      reacts more quickly, and the starting material will be enriched in the isotope
      that reacts more slowly. If you know the starting ratio of isotopes, the conversion,
      and the ratio of isotopes at partial conversion, then you can use the Bigeleisen\u2212Mayer
      equation to figure out the KIE. (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.1c07351\\\">This</a>
      is a really good review on isotope effects in general, if you want more than
      this cursory summary.)</p><p>The accuracy of the KIE measurement is thus limited
      by (1) how accurately you can determine conversion and (2) how accurately you
      can measure the isotopic composition of a sample. Although conversion can be
      annoying, the second is the more serious limitation\u2014<em>a priori</em> it\u2019s
      not obvious how to figure out what the relative abundance of various isotopes
      is.</p><p>Today, most people use approaches based on NMR spectroscopy: since
      <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C are both NMR-active nuclei, you can just integrate
      the peak of interest against another peak to figure out how much there is. (Quantitative
      <sup>13</sup>C NMR is super slow, so <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621\\\">various</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-018-0079-7\\\">tricks</a>
      can be employed to speed things up.)</p><p>But there was an age before the advent
      of accurate NMR spectroscopy where people measured isotope effects differently.
      I was awestruck by <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00834a064\\\">this
      1975 paper</a> from Cromartie and Swain reporting the measurement of a <sup>35</sup>Cl/<sup>37</sup>Cl
      isotope effect in the cyclization of 4-chlorobutanol: they report an isotope
      effect of 1.000757 \xB1 0.00015 using hydroxide as base, which they differentiate
      from an isotope effect of 1.000796 \xB1 0.00013 using water as base by Student\u2019s
      <em>t</em> test. These numbers are way, way smaller and more precise than any
      isotope effect I\u2019ve seen measured in the last few decades.</p><p>Digging
      a little deeper reveals a <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00418a038\\\">whole</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00426a047\\\">wealth</a>
      of papers using <sup>35</sup>Cl/<sup>37</sup>Cl isotope effects to study various
      mechanistic phenomena. The instrument Swain and others use (described <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jo00972a016\\\">here</a>)
      is an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, which as the name implies is a special
      sort of mass spectrometer designed specifically to measure isotopic composition.
      These instruments, although a little obscure from my point of view, are <a href=\\\"https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry-irms.html\\\">commercial</a>!</p><p>So,
      why isn\u2019t IRMS used more frequently in organic chemistry today? I think
      it\u2019s for a few reasons. IRMS, at least historically, only works on gases,
      meaning that you have to either use gaseous reactants or convert your analytes
      to gases, both of which are pretty annoying. In the Swain work, they (i) incinerate
      their samples with nitric acid, (ii) precipitate out silver chloride by adding
      silver nitrate, and then (iii) convert silver chloride to gaseous methyl chloride
      by <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00873a025\\\">heating
      with methyl iodide</a> in a sealed tube. This is certainly a lot of hassle to
      put up with for a single measurement\u2014and you generally want to get a good
      number of replicates.</p><p>(There are some <a href=\\\"https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11206175\\\">all-in-one
      solutions</a> available for sale, which automatically combust samples \xE0 la
      elemental analysis, but they don\u2019t seem to work on non-standard isotopes
      like chlorine.)</p><p>Another reason why IRMS might have fallen out of favor
      is that it requires a dedicated instrument, whereas NMR-based methods can be
      done using the NMR spectrometers that any university already has. Most labs
      only have budgets for a handful of instruments\u2014is an IRMS really worth
      the investment? (Owing to the typical aura of secrecy around instrument prices,
      I\u2019m not sure how much one costs, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a few
      hundred thousand dollars or so.)</p><p>These downsides notwithstanding, I think
      there is a lot of good science that could be done if a mechanistic group decided
      to make IRMS a core part of their program. In particular, <sup>35</sup>Cl/<sup>37</sup>Cl
      KIEs seem really powerful: there are a growing number of organometallic reactions
      which involve chlorine atoms in the key step(s), and for which Cl KIEs might
      be complementary or superior to more conventional KIEs. I\u2019m envisioning
      studying <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad6981\\\">transmetallation
      from Pd(II) chlorides</a>, or <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c13333\\\">chlorine
      radical-mediated C\u2013H activation</a>, or <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c01356\\\">photolysis
      of Ni(II) chlorides</a>.</p><p>(And why stop at Cl? According to ThermoFisher,
      thermal ionization mass spectrometry lets you analyze the isotopic composition
      of metals with really high accuracy [five decimal places, per their <a href=\\\"https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CMD/brochures/br-30537-triton-xt-tims-br30537-en.pdf\\\">brochure</a>].
      Would a <sup>58</sup>Ni/<sup>60</sup>Ni isotope effect be possible to measure?
      This might provide a handle on some mechanistically ambiguous Ni(III) scenarios,
      like those reported <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13211\\\">here</a>:
      is radical trapping or reductive elimination rate- and enantioselectivity-determining?)</p><p>It
      doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that easy to start a purely mechanistic research
      group these days, so maybe this is an unfundable idea. But it seems sad that
      a technique as powerful for physical (in)organic chemists as IRMS could just
      fade into obscurity, and I hope somebody finds the time and resources to apply
      it to modern mechanistic problems.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"A

      the H/D bond isn\u2019t involved in the reaction, we won\u2019t see a primary
      effect; so we know we have to be thinking in terms of secondary effects. The
      most common reason to observe a secondary isotope effect is changes in hybridization:
      sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> gives a normal effect, whereas sp<sup>2</sup>
      to sp<sup>3</sup> gives an inverse effect. From this perspective, it looks like
      the effect should be unity, since the carbon in question is sp<sup>2</sup> in
      both structures.</p><p>Reality, however, disagrees. <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0040403976800573\\\">Hall

      of theory and obtained an EIE of 0.851 with <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ekwan/PyQuiver\\\">PyQuiver</a>,
      qualitatively consistent with the above results.</p><p>Where does this EIE come

      typically think of the neutral resonance form on the top left, but you can also
      imagine putting a positive charge on carbon and a negative charge on oxygen
      to create a zwitterion with a C\u2013O single bond (bottom left). In neutral
      benzaldehyde, this resonance form is substantially disfavored, but in protonated
      benzaldehyde it doesn\u2019t look any worse than the \u201Cnormal\u201D top
      resonance form!</p><p>If this is true, we\u2019d expect the C\u2013O bond order
      to decrease from 2 in neutral benzaldehyde to ~1.5 in protonated benzaldehyde.
      Indeed, in my calculations the bond length increases from 1.20 \xC5 to 1.28
      \xC5 upon protonation\u2014so it seems the double bond character is decreasing!
      It\u2019s not quite the same as going from sp<sup>2</sup> to sp<sup>3</sup>,
      but the inverse KIE begins to make sense.</p><p>(This is purely guesswork, but
      my guess would be that the differences between the two structures are attenuated
      in a polar solvent like water. The zwitterionic resonance form of the neutral
      structure will be stabilized and thus the neutral aldehyde will be more polar,
      making the change to the oxocarbenium less drastic. This might explain why the
      measured EIE in water is smaller\u2014although this might also be due to counterion
      effects, or something completely unrelated.)</p><p>Let\u2019s go a level deeper.
      According to <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01542a075\\\">Streitwieser</a>,
      secondary KIEs associated with hyperconjugation originate from the creation
      or destruction of the c. 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> out-of-plane bending vibrations
      of Csp<sup>2</sup>\u2013H hydrogens, which are markedly lower in frequency than
      the c. 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> bending vibrations associated with Csp<sup>3</sup>\u2013H
      hydrogens.</p><p>Raising the frequency of a mode increases the energy required
      to inhabit the ground vibrational state (the \u201Czero-point energy\u201D)\u2014but
      deuterium is heavier and vibrates more slowly, meaning that it possesses less
      ZPE and is less affected by these changes. So when an 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> sp<sup>2</sup>
      mode transforms to a 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> sp<sup>3</sup> mode, the ZPE increases,
      but less for D than for H, so D is favored. Conversely, when a 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup>
      sp<sup>3</sup> mode transforms to a 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> sp<sup>2</sup> mode,
      the ZPE decreases, but less for D than for H, so H is favored. (For a more complete
      explanation, see <a href=\\\"https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/RRK-KIE.pdf\\\">this
      presentation by Rob Knowles</a>.)</p><p>This effect is complicated for benzaldehyde
      by the fact that the out-of-plane bend of the aldehyde couples to the out-of-plane
      bend of the phenyl ring, so there are several modes involving out-of-plane vibration
      of the aldehyde proton. When I compared the out-of-plane bend of the aldehyde
      H in both structures, I saw only minimal differences: 771, 963, 1040, and 1051
      cm<sup>-1</sup> for the neutral species, as compared to 790, 1003, and 1061
      cm<sup>-1</sup> for the protonated species. These small differences can\u2019t
      be responsible for the observed effect.</p><p>In contrast, the in-plane C\u2013H
      bend shows a big change\u20141430 cm<sup>-1</sup> for benzaldehyde, but 1644
      cm<sup>-1</sup> for the oxocarbenium (it seems to couple to the C\u2013O stretch;
      the reduced mass increases from 1.26 amu to 3.52 amu). Applying Streitweiser\u2019s
      formula for estimating the isotope effect for a specific mode gives a pretty
      good match:</p><p>kH/kD \u2248 exp(0.187/T * \u2206\u03BD) = exp(0.187/298 *
      (-214)) = 0.87</p><p>I don\u2019t understand this area well enough to comment
      on why there\u2019s a change in the in-plane vibrational frequency and not the
      out-of-plane vibrational frequency, nor do I understand how to deconvolute the
      effects of mode-to-mode coupling. Nevertheless, this provides a tentative physical
      rationale for the observation.</p><p>On a more abstract level, this case study
      illustrates why isotope effects are such a good tool. Any transformation that
      perturbs the vibrational frequencies of a given molecule can, in principle,
      be monitored by isotope effects without affecting the electronic energy surface
      at all. So, although the precise nature and magnitude of the effect might be
      hard to predict <em>a priori</em>, it\u2019s not surprising that a transformation
      as dramatic as protonating a functional group produces a sizable isotope effect.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"I\u2019m

      we\u2019ll never know the answer to these questions. But what we can do instead
      is find cases in which analogous institutions evolved in parallel, and try to
      learn from the similarities and differences between them. It\u2019s an imperfect
      substitute for rerunning the World Simulator, but it\u2019s still pretty cool.
      (This is far from an original idea: see for instance <em><a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Systems-Very-Different-Ours/dp/1793386722/\\\">Legal
      Systems Very Different From Ours</a></em>.)</p><p>Lately, I\u2019ve come to
      think about the tech/startup world as somewhat parallel to academic science
      in this manner. Why? For one, both tech and academia deal with hard problems
      that demand obscure/arcane domain-specific knowledge inaccessible to non-experts.
      (It\u2019s true that the problems are typically scientific in academia and engineering-related
      in tech, but I\u2019ve argued <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html\\\">previously</a>
      that this distinction is flimsier than it seems.) And in both fields, a few
      high performers <a href=\\\"https://nadia.xyz/top-talent\\\">vastly outperform</a>
      the rest of the field, be it a \u201C10x engineer\u201D or a Nobel laureate.</p><p>Startups,
      like academic labs, are small and agile institutions which face the task of
      raising money, building a team, selecting a hard yet solvable problem, and finding
      a solution all within a few years. In both cases, too, there are nonlinear returns
      to success: moderate success is not much better than failure, pushing founders/assistant
      professors to be as ambitious as possible.</p><p>If we accept these two fields
      as vaguely analogous, what interesting differences can we observe?</p><h3><strong>Startups
      Have Multiple Founders</strong></h3><p>I\u2019ll quote from <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html\\\">an
      essay by Paul Graham</a>, founder of Y Combinator and noted startup sage:</p><blockquote><p>Have
      you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person?
      Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn
      out to have more. It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.<br><br>What's wrong
      with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably
      means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company
      with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know
      him best.<br><br>But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company
      is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup is too hard
      for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues
      to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up
      when things go wrong.</p></blockquote><p>Ever since I read this, I\u2019ve wondered
      why no labs ever have multiple PIs. I guess this would mess with the semi-feudal
      organization of university bureaucracy, but it doesn\u2019t seem intrinsically
      bad\u2014after all, lots of startups seem to do just fine.</p><h3><strong>Startup
      Winners Can\u2019t Be Picked </strong><em><strong>Ex Ante</strong></em></h3><p>The
      VC strategy, as I understand it, is basically \u201Cfund a bunch of companies,
      and one or two of them will make it all worth our while.\u201D This is a little
      bit different than how universities approach hiring assistant professors: each
      university will typically hire a small number of professors each year, after
      much deliberation, and they have a pretty high likelihood of giving them tenure,
      at least relative to the likelihood of any given startup succeeding. (Basically,
      <a href=\\\"https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/r_and_k_selection/r_and_k.html\\\">startups
      are r-selected, whereas academic labs are K-selected.</a>)</p><p>There are a
      lot of reasons why this might be. For one, faculty members aren\u2019t just
      trying to pick a winner but also their future colleague, so personal considerations
      probably matter more. Failure in science seems more cruel, too: while a failed
      startup founder can often negotiate the \u201Csale\u201D of their company and
      parlay that into new jobs and the constant churn of tech means that there are
      always new openings for talented ex-startup employees, a lab that doesn\u2019t
      get tenure takes a toll on professor and students alike.</p><p>A hypothesis
      for why the success rate for new labs is so much higher than the success rate
      for new businesses is that many labs only succeed a little bit. They don\u2019t
      actually achieve what they dreamed about in their initial proposals, but they
      pivot and accrue enough publications and cachet to earn tenure nevertheless.
      In business, it seems harder to succeed a little bit\u2014the market is a harsher
      critic than one\u2019s peers.</p><h3><strong>Founders Should Be Focused</strong></h3><p>Paul
      Graham again, this time talking about <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\\\">the
      dangers of fundraising</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Raising money is terribly distracting.
      You're lucky if your productivity is a third of what it was before. And it can
      last for months.<br><br>I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely
      why raising money was so distracting till earlier this year. I'd noticed that
      startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched to raising
      money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised money itself. We had
      a comparatively easy time of it; the first people I asked said yes; but it took
      months to work out the details, and during that time I got hardly any real work
      done. Why? Because I thought about it all the time.</p></blockquote><p>The broader
      conclusion, from this and other essays, is that any distractions from the core
      mission of the startup are very dangerous, and should be avoided at all costs.
      This is very different from the lifestyle of new PIs, who are typically juggling
      departmental responsibilities, writing a curriculum, lecturing for the first
      time, and writing grants all while trying to get their lab up and running.</p><h3><strong>Talent
      Acquisition Is Crucial</strong></h3><p>In tech, people obsess about recruiting
      the best people possible\u2014I reviewed <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220928_talent.html\\\">a
      whole book about this</a> last year. Hiring bad programmers is #6 on PG\u2019s
      <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html\\\">list of mistakes
      that kill startups</a>, and there seems to be a general consensus that a great
      company takes great engineers, no matter what.</p><p>In contrast, professors
      don\u2019t have full control over whom they hire (for graduate students), making
      recruiting much harder. Graduate students are selected through a complex two-stage
      system involving admission to a school and then a subsequent group-joining process
      (and new assistant professors sometimes aren\u2019t even around for the first
      of these stages). You can obviously try to coax talented students to work for
      you, but the pool of accepted students interested in your subfield might be
      tiny, and they might all prefer to work for an established group\u2026</p><p>(Plus,
      there\u2019s not a good way to reward top performers in academia. All graduate
      students are equal, at least on paper\u2014you can\u2019t give someone a year-end
      bonus, or a promotion.)</p><p>A nice concrete example of this is how professors
      <a href=\\\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/hiring-programmers-in-academia\\\">struggle
      to hire competent programmers</a>, even as research scientists\u2014they aren\u2019t
      allowed to pay enough to match market rates, even when the expense would be
      well worth the money. To quote <a href=\\\"https://acoup.blog/2023/04/28/collections-academic-ranks-explained-or-what-on-earth-is-an-adjunct/?s=03#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18391\\\">Bret
      Devereaux</a>: \u201Cacademic hiring, to be frank, is not conducted seriously\u201D
      (he\u2019s discussing the humanities, but the point stands).</p><h3><strong>Successful
      Startups Grow</strong></h3><p>As a startup succeeds, it grows: while a seed-stage
      startup typically has &lt;15 people, startups at Series A often have 20\u201340,
      and startups at Series B\u2013C might have as many as 300 employees (<a href=\\\"https://www.quora.com/How-many-employees-do-early-stage-startups-have\\\">one
      ref</a>; rough numbers broadly consistent with other sources). Good companies
      grow, while bad ones die.</p><p>In contrast, it\u2019s rare for even the most
      successful US academic labs to grow past 30 people (although <a href=\\\"https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA195680544&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=00280836&amp;p=HRCA&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=mlin_oweb&amp;isGeoAuthType=true\\\">it
      occasionally happens</a>), limiting the reach of top-performing professors.
      While a huge proportion of tech employees work for the best companies (Google,
      Meta, Amazon, etc), only a very small number of students work for the best professors.</p><h3><strong>Concluding
      Thoughts</strong></h3><p>The imperfect nature of the analogy means that some
      of these points might not be useful in a normative sense: universities are not
      really optimized to produce research as efficiently as possible, and maybe that\u2019s
      fine. Likewise, startups aren\u2019t optimized to produce unprofitable research
      or train future scientists, even if these activities may in the long run be
      beneficial. (This is <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220728_consulting_as_grad_school.html#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20the%20government%20sponsors%20research%20into%20interesting%20problems%20with%20uncertain%20timeframes%20to%20do%20what%20the%20free%20market%20cannot\\\">why
      basic science is considered a public good</a>, and why the government funds
      it at all!)</p><p>Nevertheless, I think there\u2019s a lot that scientists can
      learn from startups. There is a whole army of people working to solve challenging
      technical problems in the most efficient way, and it\u2019d be prudent to study
      the wisdom that emerges.</p><p><em>Thanks to Ari Wagen and Jacob Thackston for

      of the most distinctive parts of science, relative to other fields, is the practice
      of communicating findings through peer-reviewed journal publications. Why do
      scientists communicate in this way? As I see it, scientific journals provide
      three important services to the community:</p><ol><li><p>Journals help scientists
      communicate; they disseminate scientific results to a broad audience, both within
      one\u2019s community and to a broader scientific audience.</p></li><li><p>Through
      the peer review process, journals ensure scientific correctness and keep standards
      high. You never know which of your scientific adversaries might be scrutinizing
      your work for flaws, so you\u2019re incentivized to do the best job possible.</p></li><li><p>Journals,
      and peer review, help scientists to read high-quality, impactful work by filtering
      out low-impact papers (even those which are scientifically correct). This makes
      journals a somewhat \u201Cfair\u201D way to score the importance of publications
      without being a subject-matter expert; I might not know what\u2019s happening
      these days with topological quantum materials, but if I see three <em>Science</em>/<em>Nature</em>
      papers on a CV, I\u2019ll certainly pay attention!</p></li></ol><p>(There are
      certainly other services that journals provide, like DOIs and typesetting, but
      these seem much less important to me.)</p><p>In this post, I want to (1) discuss
      the problems with scientific journals today, (2) briefly summarize the history
      of journals and explain how they came to be the way they are today, and (3)
      imagine how journals might evolve in the coming decades to adapt to the changing
      landscape of science. My central claim is that the scientific journal, as defined
      by the above criteria, has only existed since about the 1970s, and will probably
      not exist for very much longer\u2014and that\u2019s ok. (I\u2019ll also try
      and explain the esoteric meme at the top.)</p><h2><strong>1. Journals Present</strong></h2><p>Many
      people are upset about scientific journals today, and for many different reasons.</p><h3><strong>1.1
      Profits and Paywalls</strong></h3><p>The business model of scientific journals
      is, to put it lightly, unusual. <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\\\">Writing
      for </a><em><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\\\">The
      Guardian</a></em>, Stephen Buranyi describes how \u201Cscientific publishers
      manage to duck most of the actual costs\u201D that normal magazines incur by
      outsourcing their editorial duties to scientists: the very people who both write
      and read the articles:</p><blockquote><p>It is as if the New Yorker or the Economist
      demanded that journalists write and edit each other\u2019s work for free, and
      asked the government to foot the bill. Outside observers tend to fall into a
      sort of stunned disbelief when describing this setup. A 2004 parliamentary science
      and technology committee report on the industry drily observed that \u201Cin
      a traditional market suppliers are paid for the goods they provide\u201D. A
      2005 Deutsche Bank report referred to it as a \u201Cbizarre\u201D \u201Ctriple-pay\u201D
      system, in which \u201Cthe state funds most research, pays the salaries of most
      of those checking the quality of research, and then buys most of the published
      product\u201D.</p></blockquote><p>And this cost-dodging is very successful:
      scientific journals are a huge moneymaker, with Elsevier (one of the largest
      publishers) having a margin <a href=\\\"https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing\\\">in
      excess of 30%</a>, and ACS\u2019s \u201Cinformation services\u201D (publication)
      division close behind, <a href=\\\"https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/aboutacs/financial/2022-audited-financial-statements.pdf\\\">with
      a profit margin of 27%</a>.</p><p>The exorbitant fees charged by journals, and
      the concomitantly huge profits they earn, have led to increasing pushback against
      the paywall-based status quo. The Biden administration <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1\\\">has
      called</a> for all government-funded research to be free-to-read without any
      embargo by 2025, and other countries have been pursuing similar policies <a
      href=\\\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/eu-and-uk-bitten-by-the-open-access-bug/5236.article\\\">for
      some time</a>. Similarly, <a href=\\\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611\\\">MIT</a>
      and <a href=\\\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-uc-split-publishing-giant-elsevier\\\">the
      UC system</a> recently terminated their subscriptions to Elsevier over open-access
      issues. (And the rise of SciHub means that, even without a subscription, most
      scientists can still read almost any article they want\u2014threatening to completely
      destroy the closed-access model.)</p><p>In response to this pressure, journals
      have begun offering open-access alternatives, where the journal\u2019s fees
      are paid by the submitting author rather than the reader. While in theory this
      is a solution to this problem, in practice the fees for authors are so high
      that it\u2019s not a very good solution. The board of editors of NeuroImage
      <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5\\\">recently
      resigned</a> over their journal\u2019s high open-access fees\u2014and they\u2019re
      <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00135-8\\\">not the first</a>
      board of editors to do this. As <a href=\\\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls\\\">a

      Efficacy of Peer Review</strong></h3><p>In parallel, the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\\\">\u201Creplication
      crisis\u201D</a> has led to growing skepticism about the value of peer review.
      In his article <a href=\\\"https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review\\\">\u201CThe
      Rise and Fall of Peer Review,\u201D</a> Adam Mastroianni describes how experiments
      to measure its value have yielded dismal outcomes:</p><blockquote><p>Scientists
      have run studies where they deliberately add errors to papers, send them out
      to reviewers, and simply count how many errors the reviewers catch. Reviewers
      are pretty awful at this. In <a href=\\\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019606449870006X?casa_token=D5MklJnYP0MAAAAA:CzyYl8VLg-M-bvKIHxl7vWCIh8AVrkTUizQ9LZPZWh_eVT5jLf3WJlGaJQzYCsHMraF5Fh8mqw\\\">this
      study</a> reviewers caught 30% of the major flaws, in <a href=\\\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/187748\\\">this
      study</a> they caught 25%, and in <a href=\\\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1258/jrsm.2008.080062\\\">this
      study</a> they caught 29%. These were critical issues, like \u201Cthe paper
      claims to be a randomized controlled trial but it isn\u2019t\u201D and \u201Cwhen
      you look at the graphs, it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s no effect\u201D
      and \u201Cthe authors draw conclusions that are totally unsupported by the data.\u201D
      Reviewers mostly didn\u2019t notice.</p></blockquote><p>While the worst of the
      replication crisis seems to be contained to the social sciences, my own field\u2014chemistry\u2014is
      by no means exempt. As I wrote <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html\\\">previously</a>,

      Preprint Servers</strong></h3><p>The rise of preprint servers like arXiv, BioRxiv,
      and ChemRxiv also means journals aren\u2019t necessary for communication of
      scientific results. More and more, preprints dominate discussions of cutting-edge
      science, while actual peer-reviewed publications lag months to years behind.</p><p>While
      in theory preprints aren\u2019t supposed to be viewed as scientifically authoritative\u2014since
      they haven\u2019t been reviewed\u2014in practice most preprints are qualitatively
      identical to the peer-reviewed papers that they give rise to. <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285\\\">A
      retrospective analysis</a> of early COVID preprints found that the vast majority
      of preprints survived peer review without any substantive changes to their conclusions
      (although this might be biased by the fact that the worst pre-prints will never
      be accepted at all.)</p><p>If this is the case, why bother with journals at
      all? To a growing degree this seems to be the norm in CS and CS-adjacent fields:
      the landmark Google transformer paper from 2017, <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf\\\">\u201CAttention
      Is All You Need,\u201D</a> is still just a PDF on arXiv six years later, despite
      being potentially the most impactful discovery of the 2010s. Similarly, UMAP,
      <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230417_dimensionality_reduction.html\\\">which
      I discussed last week,</a> is also just <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426\\\">hanging
      out on arXiv</a>, no peer-reviewed publication in sight. Still, in chemistry
      and other sciences we\u2019re expected to publish in \u201Creal journals\u201D
      if we want to graduate or get jobs.</p><h3><strong>1.4 Impact-Neutral Reviewing</strong></h3><p>An
      implicit assumption of the scientific journal is that high-impact publications
      can be distinguished from low-impact publications without the benefit of hindsight.
      Yet many of the most impactful scientific discoveries\u2014like the Krebs cycle,
      the weak interaction, lasers, continental drift, and CRISPR\u2014<a href=\\\"https://nintil.com/discoveries-ignored\\\">were
      rejected</a> when first submitted to journals. How is this possible?</p><p>I\u2019d
      argue that peer review creates a bias towards incrementalism. It\u2019s easy
      to see how an improvement over something already known is significant; it\u2019s
      perhaps harder to appreciate the impact of a field-defining discovery, or to
      believe that such a result could even be possible. To quote Antonio Garcia Martinez
      on startups: \u201CIf your idea is any good, it won\u2019t get stolen, you\u2019ll
      have to jam it down people\u2019s throats instead.\u201D True zero-to-one thinking
      can provoke a strong reaction from the establishment, and rarely a positive
      one.</p><p>(It\u2019s worth noting that some of the highest profile organic
      chemistry papers from 2022 were new takes on old, established, reactions: <a
      href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.2c05648\\\">Parasram</a>
      and <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05211-0\\\">Leonori\u2019s</a>
      \u201Cozonolysis without ozone\u201D and <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo6443\\\">Nagib\u2019s</a>
      \u201Ccarbenes without diazoalkanes.\u201D I love both papers\u2014but I also
      think it\u2019s easier for audiences to appreciate why \u201Cozonolysis without
      ozone\u201D is a big deal than to process an entirely new idea.)</p><p>Even
      for more quotidian scientific results, the value of impact-based peer review
      is limited. Matt Clancy at <em><a href=\\\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/nc5341ua/release/3\\\">New
      Things Under the Sun</a></em> writes that, for preprints, paper acceptance is
      indeed correlated with number of eventual citations, but that the correlation
      is weak: reviewers seem to be doing better than random chance, but worse than
      we might hope. (Similar results emerge when studying the efficacy of peer review
      for grants.) On the aggregate, it does seem true that the average <em>JACS</em>
      paper is better than the average <em>JOC</em> paper, but the trend is far from
      monotonic.</p><p>These concerns aren\u2019t just mine; indeed, a growing number
      of scientists seek to reject impact-based refereeing altogether. The <a href=\\\"http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/2016/01/writing-impact-neutral-review.html?m=1&amp;s=03\\\">\u201Cimpact-neutral
      reviewing\u201D</a> movement thinks that papers should be evaluated only on
      the basis of their scientific correctness, not their perceived potential impact.
      Although I wouldn\u2019t say this is a mainstream idea, journals like <em><a
      href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information\\\">PLOS One</a></em>,
      <em><a href=\\\"https://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/\\\">Frontiers</a></em>,
      and <em><a href=\\\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research\\\">eLife</a></em>
      have adopted versions of it, and perhaps more journals will follow in the years
      to come.</p><p>Taken together, these anecdotes demonstrate that all three pillars
      of the modern scientific journal\u2014communication, peer review, and impact-based
      sorting\u2014are threatened today.</p><h2><strong>2. Journals Past</strong></h2><p>How
      did we get here?</p><p>The importance of journals as a filter for low-quality
      work is a modern phenomenon. Of course, editors have always had discretion over
      what to publish, but until fairly recently <a href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490\\\">the
      total volume of papers was much lower</a>, meaning that it wasn\u2019t so vital
      to separate the wheat from the chaff. In fact, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\\\">Stephen
      Buranyi</a> attributes the modern obsession with impact factor and prestige
      to the founding of <em>Cell</em> in 1974:</p><blockquote><p>[<em>Cell</em>]
      was edited by a young biologist named Ben Lewin, who approached his work with
      an intense, almost literary bent. Lewin prized long, rigorous papers that answered
      big questions \u2013 often representing years of research that would have yielded
      multiple papers in other venues \u2013 and, breaking with the idea that journals
      were passive instruments to communicate science, he rejected far more papers
      than he published\u2026.<br><br>Suddenly, where you published became immensely
      important. Other editors took a similarly activist approach in the hopes of
      replicating <em>Cell</em>\u2019s success. Publishers also adopted a metric called
      \u201Cimpact factor,\u201D invented in the 1960s by Eugene Garfield, a librarian
      and linguist, as a rough calculation of how often papers in a given journal
      are cited in other papers. For publishers, it became a way to rank and advertise
      the scientific reach of their products. The new-look journals, with their emphasis
      on big results, shot to the top of these new rankings, and scientists who published
      in \u201Chigh-impact\u201D journals were rewarded with jobs and funding. Almost
      overnight, a new currency of prestige had been created in the scientific world.</p></blockquote><p>As
      Buranyi reports, the changes induced by <em>Cell</em> rippled across the journal
      ecosystem. The acceptance rate at <em>Nature</em> <a href=\\\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature\\\">dropped
      from 35% to 13%</a> over the following decade-and-a-half (coincidentally also
      the years when peer review was introduced), making journal editors the \u201Ckingmakers
      of science\u201D (Buranyi).</p><p>Peer review is also a modern addition. In
      <em><a href=\\\"https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3463\\\">Physics
      Today</a></em>, Melissa Baldwin recounts how peer review only became ubiquitous
      following a series of contentious House subcommittee hearings in 1974 that questioned
      the value of NSF-funded science:</p><blockquote><p>Spending on both basic and
      applied research had increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s\u2014but
      when doubts began to creep in about the public value of the work that money
      had funded, scientists were faced with the prospect of losing both public trust
      and access to research funding. Legislators wanted publicly funded science to
      be accountable; scientists wanted decisions about science to be left in expert
      hands. Trusting peer review to ensure that only the best and most essential
      science received funding seemed a way to split the difference.</p></blockquote><p>Our
      expectation that journals ought to validate the correctness of the work they
      publish, too, is quite modern. Baldwin again:</p><blockquote><p>It also seems
      significant that refereeing procedures were not initially developed to detect
      fraud or to ensure the accuracy of scientific claims\u2026. Authors, not referees,
      were responsible for the contents of their papers. It was not until the 20th
      century that anyone thought a referee should be responsible for the quality
      of the scientific literature, and not until the Cold War that something had
      to be peer-reviewed to be seen as scientifically legitimate.</p></blockquote><p>If
      journals didn\u2019t do peer review and they didn\u2019t do (as much) impact-based
      filtering before the 1970s, what <em>did</em> they do? The answer is simple:
      communication. Scientists started communicating in journals because writing
      books was too slow, and it was important that they be able to share results
      and get feedback on their ideas quickly. This was a founding aim of <em>Nature</em>:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026to
      aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made
      in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them
      an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from
      time to time.</p></blockquote><p>Although perhaps underwhelming to a modern
      audience, this makes sense. Scientists back in the day didn\u2019t have preprints,
      Twitter, or Zoom\u2014so they published journal articles because it was \u201Cone
      of the fastest ways to bring a scientific issue or idea to their fellow researchers\u2019
      attention\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature\\\">ref</a>),
      not because it would look good on their CV. Journals became \u201Cthe place
      to discuss big science questions\u201D among researchers, and frequently featured
      acrimonious and public disputes between researchers\u2014far from celebrated
      storehouses of truth, journals were simply the social media of pre-communication
      age scientists.</p><h2><strong>3. Journals\u2019 Future?</strong></h2><p>So,
      is the solution \u201Creject modernity, embrace tradition\u201D? Should we go
      back to the way things used to be and stop worrying about whether published
      articles are correct or impactful?</p><p>Anyone who\u2019s close to the scientific
      publishing process knows that this would be ridiculous and suicidal. We\u2019ve
      come a long way from the intimate scientific community of 18th-century England,
      where scientists had reputations to uphold and weren\u2019t incentivized to
      crank out a bunch of <em>Tet. Lett.</em> papers. Like it or not, today\u2019s
      scientists have been trained to think of their own productivity in terms of
      publications, and the editorial standards we have today are just barely keeping
      a sea of low-quality crap at bay (cf. <a href=\\\"https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490\\\">Goodhart\u2019s
      Law</a>). Sometimes it feels like peer reviewers are the only people who are
      willing to give me honest criticism about my work\u2014if we get rid of them,
      what then?</p><p>We can understand the changes in journals by borrowing some
      thinking from economics: as the scale of communities increases, the norms and
      institutions of the community must progress from informal to formal. This process
      <a href=\\\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/development-of-property-rights-on-frontiers-endowments-norms-and-politics/23F4D5DB23AE6EC415ADF049F6CD0B54\\\">has
      been documented nicely</a> for the development of property rights on frontiers:
      at first, land is abundant, and no property rights are necessary. Later on,
      inhabitants develop a <em>de facto</em> system of informal property rights to
      mediate disputes\u2014and still later, these <em>de facto</em> property rights
      are transformed into <em>de jure</em> property rights, raising them to the status
      of law. Communities with 10,000 people need more formal institutions than communities
      with 100 people.</p><p>If we revisit the history of scientific journals, we
      can see an analogous process taking place. Centuries ago there were relatively
      few scientists, and so journals could simply serve as a bulletin board for whatever
      these scientists were up to. As the scale and scope of science expanded in the
      late 20th century, peer review became a way to deal with the rising number of
      scientific publications, sorting the good from the bad and providing feedback.
      Today, as the scale of science continues to increase and the communication revolution
      renders many of the historical functions of journals moot, it seems that journals
      will have to change again, to adapt to the new needs of the community.</p><p>To
      the extent that this post has a key prediction, it\u2019s this: scientific journals
      are going to change a lot in the decade or two to come. If you\u2019re a scientist
      today\u2014even a relatively venerable one\u2014you\u2019ve lived your whole
      career in the post-peer review era, and so I think people have gotten used to
      the status quo. Submitting papers to journals, getting referee reviews, etc
      are part of what we\u2019re taught \u201Cbeing a scientist\u201D means. But
      this hasn\u2019t always been true, and it may not be true within your lifetime!</p><p>Sadly,
      I don\u2019t really have a specific high-confidence prediction for how journals
      will change, or how they should change. Instead, I want to sketch out nine little
      vignettes of what could happen to journals, good or bad. These options are neither
      mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive; it\u2019s meant simply as an
      exercise in creativity, and to provide a little basis set with which to imagine
      the future.</p><p>I\u2019ll repost the initial image of the post here, for ambiance,
      and then walk through the possibilities.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      The Journal as Bastion of Verified Truth</strong></h3><p>One scenario is that
      journals, no longer being needed to distribute results widely, will double down
      on their role as defenders of scientific correctness. To a much greater degree,
      journals will focus on only publishing truly correct work, and thus make peer
      review their key \u201Cvalue add.\u201D This is already being done post-replication
      crisis in some fields; Michael Nielsen and Kanjun Qiu describe the rise of \u201CRegistered
      Reports\u201D in their <a href=\\\"https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/\\\">essay
      on metascience</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The idea [behind Registered Reports] is
      for scientists to design their study in advance: exactly what data is to be
      taken, exactly what analyses are to be run, what questions asked. That study
      design is then pre-registered publicly, and before data is taken the design
      is refereed at the journal. The referees can't know whether the results are
      \\\"interesting\\\", since no data has yet been taken. There are (as yet) no
      results! Rather, they're looking to see if the design is sound, and if the questions
      being asked are interesting \u2013 which is quite different to whether the answers
      are interesting! If the paper passes this round of peer review, only then are
      the experiments done, and the paper completed.</p></blockquote><p>This makes
      more sense for medicine or psychology than it does for more exploratory sciences\u2014if
      you\u2019re blundering around synthesizing novel low-valent Bi complexes, it\u2019s
      tough to know what you\u2019ll find or what experiments you\u2019ll want to
      run! But there are other ways we could make science more rigorous, if we wanted
      to.</p><p>A start would be requiring original datafiles (e.g. for NMR spectra)
      instead of just providing a PDF with images, and having reviewers examine these
      data. ACS has made some moves in this direction (<a href=\\\"https://publish.acs.org/publish/data_policy\\\">e.g.</a>),
      although to my knowledge no ACS journal yet requires original data. One could
      also imagine requiring all figures to be linked to the underlying data, with
      code supplied by the submitting group (like a Jupyter notebook). A more drastic
      step would be to require all results to be independently reproduced by another
      research group, <a href=\\\"http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx\\\">like </a><em><a
      href=\\\"http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx\\\">Organic Syntheses</a></em><a href=\\\"http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx\\\">
      does</a>.</p><p>These efforts would certainly make the scientific literature
      more accurate, but at what cost? Preparing publications already consumes an
      excessive amount of time and energy, and making peer review stricter might just
      exacerbate this problem. Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy discuss this in a nice
      <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206685/\\\">perspective</a>
      on perverse incentives in modern science:</p><blockquote><p>Assuming that the
      goal of the scientific enterprise is to maximize true scientific progress, a
      process that overemphasizes quality might require triple or quadruple blinded
      studies, mandatory replication of results by independent parties, and peer-review
      of all data and statistics before publication\u2014such a system would minimize
      mistakes, but would produce very few results due to overcaution.</p></blockquote><p>It
      seems good that there are some \u201Covercautious\u201D journals, like <em>Org.
      Syn.</em>, but it also seems unlikely that all of science will adopt this model.
      In fact, a move in this direction might create a two-tiered system: some journals
      would adopt stringent policies, but there\u2019s a huge incentive for some journals
      to defect and avoid these policies, since authors are lazy and would prefer
      not to do extra work. It seems unlikely that all of science could realistically
      be moved to a \u201Cbastion of truth\u201D model in the near future, although
      perhaps we could push the needle in that direction.</p><h3><strong>3.2 The Journal
      as Guild-Approved Periodical</strong></h3><p>If peer review is so vital, why
      not make it a real career? Imagine a world in which journals like <em>Nature</em>
      and <em>Science</em> have their own in-house experts, recruited to serve as
      professional overseers and custodians of science. Instead of your manuscript
      getting sent to some random editor, and thence to whomever deigns to respond
      to that editor\u2019s request for reviewers, your manuscript would be scrutinized
      by a team of hand-picked domain specialists. This would certainly cost money,
      but journals seem to have a bit of extra cash to spare.</p><p>I call this scenario
      the \u201Cguild-approved periodical\u201D because the professionals who determined
      which papers got published would essentially be managers, or leaders, of science\u2014they
      would have a good amount of power over other scientists, to a degree that seems
      uncommon today. Thus, this model would amount to a centralization of science:
      if <em>Nature</em> says you have to do genomics a certain way, you have to do
      it that way or <em>Nature</em> journals won\u2019t publish your work! I\u2019m
      not sure whether this would be good or bad.</p><p>(It is a little funny that
      the editors of high-tier journals\u2014arguably the most powerful people in
      their field\u2014are chosen without the knowledge or consent of the field, through
      processes that are completely opaque to rank-and-file scientists. To the extent
      that this proposal allows scientists to choose their own governance, it might
      be good.)</p><h3><strong>3.3 The Journal as Living Knowledge Aggregator</strong></h3><p>This
      scenario envisions a world in which \u201Cpublications\u201D are freed from
      the tyranny of needing to be complete at a certain point. While that was true
      in the days when you actually got a published physical issue in the mail, it\u2019s
      not necessary in the Internet age! Instead, one can imagine a dynamic process
      of publishing, where a journal article is continually updated in response to
      new data.</p><p>A 2020 article in <em><a href=\\\"https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0012\\\">FACETS</a></em>
      proposes exactly this model:</p><blockquote><p>The paper of the future may be
      a digital-only document that is not only discussed openly after the peer-review
      process but also regularly updated with time-stamped versions and complementary
      research by different authors\u2026 Living systematic reviews are another valuable
      way to keep research up to date in rapidly evolving fields. The papers of the
      future that take the form of living reviews can help our understanding of a
      topic keep pace with the research but will also add complexities. <em>(citations
      removed from passage)</em></p></blockquote><p>The idea of the living systematic
      review is being tried out by the <em><a href=\\\"https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031\\\">Living
      Journal of Computational Molecular Science</a></em>, which (among other things)
      has published a 60-page <a href=\\\"https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031\\\">review
      of enhanced sampling methods in MD</a>, which will continue being updated as
      the field evolves.</p><p>These ideas are cool, but I wonder what would happen
      if more research became \u201Cliving.\u201D Disputes and acrimony are part of
      the collective process of scientific truth-seeking. What will happen if bitter
      rivals start working on the same \u201Cliving\u201D publications\u2014who will
      adjudicate their disputes?</p><p>Wikipedia manages to solve this problem through
      a plethora of editors, who can even lock down particularly controversial pages,
      and perhaps editors of living journals will assume analogous roles. But the
      ability of our collective scientific intelligence to simultaneously believe
      contradictory ideas seems like a virtue, not a vice, and I worry that living
      journals will squash this.</p><p>An even thornier question is who adjudicates
      questions of impact. The enhanced sampling review linked above has over 400
      references, making it a formidable tome for a non-expert like myself. There\u2019s
      a lot of merit in a non-comprehensive and opinionated introduction to the field,
      which takes some subjective editorial liberties, but it\u2019s not clear to
      me how that would work in a collaborative living journal. What\u2019s to stop
      me from linking to my own papers everywhere?</p><p>(I\u2019m sure that there
      are clever organizational and administrative solutions to these problems; I
      just don\u2019t know what they are.)</p><h3><strong>3.4 The Journal as Curated
      Scientific Vision</strong></h3><p>If \u201Cobjective impact\u201D is so hard
      to determine fairly, why not just accept that we\u2019re basically just subjectively
      scoring publications based on how much we like them, and abandon the pretense
      of objectivity? One can imagine the rise of a new kind of figure: the editor
      with authorial license, who has a specific vision for what they think science
      should look like and publishes work in keeping with that vision. The role is
      as much aesthetic as it is analytic.</p><p>There\u2019s some historical precedent
      for this idea\u2014Eric Gilliam\u2019s written about how Warren Weaver, a grant
      director for the Rockefeller Foundation, essentially <a href=\\\"https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/a-report-on-scientific-branch-creation\\\">created
      the field of molecular biology</a> <em>ex nihilo</em> by following an opinionated
      thesis about what work ought to be funded. Likewise, one can envision starting
      a journal as an act of community-building, essentially creating a Schelling
      point for like-minded scientists to collaborate, share results, and develop
      a common approach to science.</p><p>We can see hints of this today: newsletters
      like <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.3c00060\\\">\u201CSome
      Items of Interest to Process Chemists\u201D</a> or Elliot Hershberg\u2019s <em><a
      href=\\\"https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about\\\">Century of Bio</a></em><a
      href=\\\"https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about\\\"> Substack</a> highlight
      a particular vision of science, although they haven\u2019t quite advanced to
      the stage of formally publishing papers themselves. But perhaps it will happen
      soon; new movements, like molecular editing or digital chemistry, might benefit
      from forming more tightly-knit communities.</p><h3><strong>3.5 The Journal as
      Post Hoc Impact Archive</strong></h3><p>If preprints take over every field of
      science as thoroughly as they have computer science, journals may find themselves
      almost completely divorced from the day-to-day practice of science, for better
      or for worse. Papers might still be submitted to journals, and the status of
      the journal might still mean something, but it wouldn\u2019t be a guess anymore\u2014journals
      could simply accept the advances already proven to be impactful and basically
      just publish a nicely formatted \u201Cversion of record,\u201D like a scientific
      Library of Congress.</p><p>This is essentially equivalent to the \u201Cpublish
      first, curate second\u201D proposal of <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116\\\">Stern
      and O\u2019Shea</a>\u2014preprints eliminate the need for journals to move quickly,
      so we can just see what work the community finds to be best and collect that
      into journals. The value of journals for specialists, who already need to be
      reading a large fraction of the papers in their area, would be much lower\u2014journals
      would mainly be summarizing a field\u2019s achievements for those out-of-field.
      In this scenario, \u201Cmany specialized journals that currently curate a large
      fraction of the literature will become obsolete.\u201D</p><p>(This already happens
      sometimes; I remember chuckling at the 2020 Numpy <em>Nature</em> <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2\\\">paper</a>.
      Numpy isn\u2019t successful because it was published in <em>Nature</em>; Numpy
      got into <em>Nature</em> because it was already successful.)</p><h3><strong>3.6
      The Journal as Antediluvian Status Symbol</strong></h3><p>Pessimistically, one
      can imagine a world in which journal publications still carry weight with the
      \u201Cold guard\u201D and certain sentimental types, but the scientific community
      has almost completely moved to preprints for day-to-day communication. In this
      scenario, one might still have to publish journal articles to get a job, but
      it\u2019s just a formality, like a dissertation: the active work of science
      is done through preprints. Like Blockbuster, journals might limp along for some
      time, but their fate is pretty much sealed.</p><h3><strong>3.7 The Journal as
      Philanthropic Pravda</strong></h3><p>Another reason why journals might persist
      in a world driven by preprints is the desire of philanthropic agencies to appear
      beneficent. If a certain organization, public or private, is giving tens of
      millions of dollars to support scientific progress, the only real reward it
      can reap in the short term is the prestige of having its name associated with
      a given discovery. Why not go one step further and control the means of publication?</p><p>In
      this <em>Infinite Jest</em>-like vision, funding a certain project buys you
      the right to publish its results in your own journal. We can imagine <em>J.
      Pfizer-Funded Research</em> and <em>J. Navy Research</em> competing to fund
      and publish the most exciting work in a given area, since no one wants to sponsor
      a loser. (Why stop there? Why not name things after corporate sponsors? We could
      have the Red Bull\u2013Higgs Boson, or the Wittig\u2013Genentech olefination.)</p><p>As
      discussed at the beginning of this article, the government \u201Cfunds most
      research, pays the salaries of most of those checking the quality of research,
      and then buys most of the published product.\u201D There\u2019s a certain simplicity
      in a funding agency just taking over the whole process, but I doubt this would
      be good for scientists. Unifying the roles of funder, publisher, and editor
      would probably lower the agency of actual researchers to an untenably low level.</p><h3><strong>3.8
      The Journal as Rent-Seeking Data Troll</strong></h3><p>Another depressing scenario
      is one in which journals cease contributing to the positive progress of science,
      and start essentially just trying to monetize their existing intellectual property.
      As ML and AI become more important, legal ownership of data rights will presumably
      increase in economic value, and one can easily imagine the Elseviers of the
      world vacuuming up any smaller journals they can and then charging exorbitant
      fees for access to their data. (Goodbye, Reaxys\u2026)</p><p>I hope this doesn\u2019t
      happen.</p><h3><strong>3.9 No Journals; Just an Anarchic Preprint Lake</strong></h3><p>The
      obvious alternative to these increasingly far-fetched scenarios is also the
      simplest; we get rid of journals all together, and\u2014just like in the 1700s\u2014rely
      solely on communication-style preprints on arXiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc. This
      has been termed a \u201Cpreprint lake,\u201D in analogy to <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake\\\">\u201Cdata
      lakes.\u201D</a></p><p>To help scientists make sense of the lake, one can envision
      some sort of preprint aggregator: a Reddit or Hacker News for science, which
      sorts papers by audience feedback and permits <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubPeer\\\">PubPeer</a>-type
      public comments on the merits and shortcomings of each publication. The home
      page of Reddit-for-papers could serve as the equivalent to <em>Science</em>;
      the chemistry-specific subpage, the equivalent to <em>JACS</em>. Peer review
      could happen in a decentralized fashion, and reviews would be public for all
      to see.</p><p>There\u2019s an anarchic appeal to this proposal, but it has potential
      drawbacks too:</p><ol><li><p>For those not immersed in a given field, it\u2019s
      very difficult to know what\u2019s good research and what isn\u2019t. This is
      doubly true for non-scientists\u2014what will become of high-school students
      trying to write papers?</p></li><li><p>Existing status symbols will become more
      important absent journal status. To quote <a href=\\\"https://luispedro.substack.com/p/against-publication-lakes-glam-journals?s=03\\\">Luis
      Pedro Coelho</a>:</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>I mostly read preprints by people
      whose names I already recognize. When thousands of papers are thrown into the
      \u201Clevel playing field\u201D of biorxiv, pre-existing markers of prestige
      end up taking an even greater role.</p></blockquote><ol><li><p>This presumably
      will disadvantage up-and-coming scientists, or scientists without access to
      existing networks of prestige. That being said, one might make the same arguments
      for the Internet, and the real effect seems to have been exactly the opposite!
      So I\u2019m not quite sure how to think about this.</p></li><li><p>What \u201Cgoes
      viral\u201D may not always be what\u2019s the best science. Rarely do thoughtful
      or contemplative ideas rise to popularity out of the unstructured morass of
      the Internet, and I find it na\xEFve to expect that scientists would be any
      different here. That being said, the wisdom of crowds might be the lesser of
      two evils, given that our current system is basically \u201Cask three random
      rivals in the field.\u201D</p></li><li><p>There are also just so many papers
      out there today that it might just become overwhelming, even to specialists.
      I miss papers in \u201Cmy areas\u201D constantly, and I try pretty hard to keep
      up with the literature! (Some have proposed that <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1514\\\">AI
      might help us sift through things</a>, but AI might also help people write more
      papers faster\u2014tough to say who will win.)</p></li><li><p>Without the implicit
      threat of peer review, standards might ebb across the board. I think this is
      a real concern, but it\u2019s possible that the same community norms enforced
      through today\u2019s peer review might also be enforced through whatever decentralized
      review process replaces it. <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-013-9420-1\\\">There\u2019s
      some evidence</a> that, in knowledge industries with high information asymmetry
      (like science), communities tend to spontaneously develop strong systems of
      self-regulation.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>4. Conclusion: Archipelagic Multiverse</strong></h2><p>The
      most likely scenario, to me, is that all of this sorta happens simultaneously.
      Most cutting-edge scientific discussion will move to the anarchic world of preprints,
      but there will still be plenty of room for more traditional journals: some journals
      will have very high standards and represent the <a href=\\\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/\\\">magisterium
      of scientific authority</a>, while other journals will act as living repositories
      of knowledge and still others will become subjectively curated editorial statements.</p><p>We
      can see journals moving in different directions even today: some journals are
      indicating that they\u2019ll start requiring original data and implement more
      aggressive fraud detection, while others are moving away from impact-based reviewing.
      And I can\u2019t help but notice that it seems to be increasingly acceptable
      to cite preprints in publications, suggesting that the needle might be moving
      towards the \u201Canarchic preprint lake\u201D scenario ever so slightly.</p><p>For
      my part, I plan to continue writing and submitting papers as necessary, reviewing
      papers when asked, and so forth\u2014but I\u2019m excited for the future, and
      to see how the new world order compares to the old.</p><p><em>Thanks to Melanie

      fingerprints</a> are typically 2048-length binary vectors, meaning that \u201Cchemical
      space\u201D as encoded by fingerprints is 2048-dimensional.</p><p>To more easily
      handle these complex datasets (and to bypass the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality\\\">\u201Ccurse
      of dimensionality\u201D</a>), it\u2019s common practice to use a dimensionality
      reduction algorithm to convert the data to a low-dimensional space. In this
      post I want to compare and contrast three approaches to dimensionality reduction,
      and discuss the challenges with low-dimensional embeddings in general.</p><h2><strong>Dimensionality
      Reduction Algorithms</strong></h2><p>There are many approaches to dimensionality
      reduction, but I\u2019m only going to talk about three here: PCA, tSNE, and
      UMAP.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis\\\">Principal
      component analysis</a> (PCA) is perhaps the most famous dimensionality reduction
      algorithm, and is commonly used in a variety of scientific fields. PCA works
      by transforming the data into a new set of coordinates such that the first coordinate
      vector explains the largest amount of the variance, the second coordinate vector
      the next most variance, and so on and so forth. It\u2019s pretty common for
      the first 5\u201320 dimensions to capture &gt;99% of the variance, meaning that
      the subsequent dimensions can essentially be discarded wholesale.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\\\">tSNE</a>
      (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and <a href=\\\"https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html\\\">UMAP</a>
      (uniform manifold approximation and projection) are alternative dimensionality
      reduction approaches, based on much more complex algorithms. To quote Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p>The
      t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs a probability
      distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar
      objects are assigned a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned
      a lower probability. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution
      over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullback\u2013Leibler
      divergence (KL divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the
      locations of the points in the map.</p></blockquote><p>UMAP, at a high level,
      works in a very similar way, but uses some fancy topology to construct a \u201Cfuzzy
      simplicial complex\u201D representation of the data in high-dimensional space,
      and then projects this representation down into a lower dimension (<a href=\\\"https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/\\\">more
      detailed explanation</a>). Practically, UMAP is a lot faster than tSNE, and
      is becoming the algorithm of choice for most cheminformatics applications. (Although,
      in fairness, there are <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09005\\\">ways
      to make tSNE faster</a>.)</p><h2><strong>Data Visualization</strong></h2><p>For
      the purposes of this post, I chose to study Abbie Doyle\u2019s set of <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203\\\">2683
      aryl bromides</a> (obtained from Reaxys, with various filters applied). I used
      the RDKIT7 fingerprint to generate a 2048-bit encoding of each aryl bromide,
      computed a distance matrix using Tanimoto/Jaccard distance, and then used each
      dimensionality reduction technique to generate a 2-dimensional embedding.</p><p>Let\u2019s
      look at PCA first:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      also creates tight tSNE-like clusters, but UMAP plots generally have a much
      more variable overall shape\u2014the clusters themselves are tighter and scattered
      across more space. (These considerations are complicated by the fact that UMAP
      has multiple tunable hyperparameters, meaning that the exact appearance of the
      plot is substantially up to the end user.)</p><p>The debate between tSNE and
      UMAP is spirited (<a href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.877522v1.full.pdf\\\">e.g.</a>),
      but for whatever reason people in chemistry almost exclusively use UMAP. (See,
      for instance, pretty much every paper I taked about <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230118_meta_optimization.html\\\">in
      this post</a>.)</p><p>An important thing that I\u2019m not showing here, but
      which bears mentioning, is that the clusters in all three plots are actually
      chemically meaningful. For instance, each cluster in the tSNE plot generally
      corresponds to a different functional group: carboxylic acids, alkynes, etc.
      So the graphs do in some real sense correspond to the intuition we have about
      molecular similarity, which is good! (You can use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly\\\">molplotly</a>
      to visualize these plots very easily.)</p><h2><strong>Distance Preservation</strong></h2><p>How
      well are distances from the high-dimensional space preserved in the 2D embedding?
      Obviously the distances won\u2019t all be the same, but ideally the mapping
      would be monotonic: if distance A is greater than distance B in the high-dimensional
      space, we would like distance A to also be greater than distance B in the low-dimensional
      space.</p><p>We can measure this with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient\\\">Spearman
      correlation</a>, which is like a Pearson correlation (AKA \u201Cr-squared\u201D)
      but without the assumption of linearity. A Spearman correlation coefficient
      of 1 indicates a perfect monotonic relationship, while a coefficient of 0 indicates
      no relationship. Let\u2019s plot the pairwise distances from each embedding
      against the true distances and compare the Spearman coefficients:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      space has a very distinct histogram. Most of the compounds are pretty different
      from one another, and\u2014crucially\u2014most of the distances are about the
      same (0.8 or so). In chemical terms, this means that most of the fingerprints
      share a few epitopes in common, but otherwise are substantially different, which
      is unsurprising since fingerprints in general are quite sparse.</p><p>Unfortunately,
      \u201Clots of equidistant points\u201D is an extremely tough pattern to recapitulate
      in a low-dimensional space. We can see why with a toy example: in 2D space,
      we can only have 3 equidistant points (an equilateral triangle), and in 3D space,
      we can only have 4 equidistant points (a tetrahedron). More generally, if we
      want <em>N</em> equidistant points, we need to be in <strong>R</strong><em><sup>N</sup></em><sup>-1</sup>
      (<em>N</em>-1 dimensional Euclidean space). We can <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma\\\">relax
      this requirement</a> a little bit if we\u2019re willing to accept approximate
      equidistance, but the general principle still holds: it\u2019s hard to recapitulate
      lots of equidistant points in a low-dimensional space.</p><p>As expected, then,
      we can see that the histogram of each of our algorithms looks very different
      from the ideal distance histogram.</p><h2><strong>Local Structure</strong></h2><p>Both
      tSNE and UMAP take the nearest neighbors of each point explicitly into account,
      and claim to preserve the local structure of the points as much as possible.
      To put these claims to the test, I looked at the closest 30 neighbors of each
      point in high-dimensional space, and then checked how many of those neighbors
      made it into the closest 30 neighbors in low-dimensional space.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      that UMAP and tSNE both preserve about 60% of the neighbors across a wide range
      of neighborhood sizes, while PCA gets better as we zoom out more. (At the limit
      where we consider all 2683 points as neighbors, every method will trivially
      achieve perfect accuracy.) tSNE does much better than UMAP for small neighborhoods;
      I\u2019m not sure why!</p><p>Another way to think about this is in terms of
      the <a href=\\\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html\\\">precision\u2013recall
      tradeoff</a>. In classification, \u201Cprecision\u201D refers to a classifier\u2019s
      ability to avoid false positives, while \u201Crecall\u201D refers to a classifier\u2019s
      ability to avoid false negatives. What does this mean in the context of embedding?</p><p>Imagine
      looking at all points in the neighborhood of our central point in high-dimensional
      space, and then comparing to the points within a certain radius of our point
      in low-dimensional space. As we increase the radius, we expect to see more of
      the correct neighbor points in low-dimensional space, but we also expect to
      see more \u201Cincorrect neighbors\u201D that aren\u2019t really there in the
      high-dimensional space. (<a href=\\\"https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/venna10a/venna10a.pdf\\\">This
      paper</a> discusses these issues nicely, as does <a href=\\\"https://coursepages2.tuni.fi/mttts17/wp-content/uploads/sites/136/2020/03/drv_2020_lecture_7.pdf\\\">this
      presentation</a>.)</p><p>So low radii lead to high precision (most of the points
      are really neighbors) but low recall (we\u2019re not finding most of the neighbors),
      while high radii lead to low precision and high recall. We can thus study the
      performance of our embedding by graphing the precision\u2013recall curve for
      various neighborhood sizes. The better the embedding, the closer the curve will
      come to the top right:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      in the high precision/low recall area of the curve (as we saw in the previous
      graph), but otherwise tSNE and UMAP are quite comparable. In contrast, PCA is
      just abysmal.</p><p>The big conclusion of this section is that, if you\u2019re
      doing something that depends on the local structure of the data, you should
      avoid PCA.</p><h2><strong>Do Higher Dimensions Help Things?</strong></h2><p>Since
      the root of our issues here is trying to represent a 2048-dimensional distance
      matrix in 2 dimensions, one might wonder if we could do better by expanding
      to 3, 4, or more dimensions. This would make visualization tricky, but might
      still be suitable for other operations (like clustering).</p><p>tSNE gets very,
      very slow in higher dimensions, so I focused on PCA and UMAP for this study.
      I started out by comparing the Spearman correlation for PCA and UMAP up to 20
      dimensions:</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a class=\\\"image-link

      graph is still pretty dismal when compared to tSNE or UMAP. So, it seems like
      if distances are what matters, then high-dimensional PCA is an appealing choice\u2014but
      if local structure is what matters, tSNE or UMAP is still superior.</p><h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2><p>My
      big takeaway from all of this is: dimensionality reduction is a lossy process,
      and one where you always have to make tradeoffs. You\u2019re fundamentally throwing
      away information, and that always has a cost: there\u2019s no such thing as
      a free lunch. As such, if you don\u2019t have to perform dimensionality reduction,
      then my inclination would be to avoid it. (People in single-cell genomics seem
      to have come to <a href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v4.full.pdf\\\">a
      similar conclusion</a>.)</p><p>If you really need your data to be in a low-dimensional
      space (e.g. for plotting), then keep in mind what you\u2019re trying to study!
      PCA seems to do a slightly better job with distances (although I\u2019m sure
      there are more sophisticated strategies for distance-preserving dimensionality
      reduction), while tSNE and UMAP seem to do much, much better with local structure.</p><p><em>Thanks

      explanation is the <a href=\\\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c2144/c2144.pdf\\\">Arrow
      replacement effect</a> (named after <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow\\\">Kenneth
      Arrow</a>), which states that \u201Cpreinvention monopoly power acts as a strong
      disincentive to further innovation.\u201D Arrow\u2019s argument goes like this:
      suppose there\u2019s an organization that is earning profit <em>P<sub>old</sub></em>,
      and there is some innovation that will increase profit to <em>P<sub>new</sub></em>
      (<em>P<sub>new</sub></em> &gt; <em>P<sub>old</sub></em>). If the existing organization
      pursues the innovation, their profits will thus increase by <em>\u2206P</em>
      := <em>P<sub>new</sub></em> - <em>P<sub>old</sub></em>. But a new organization
      will see its profits increase by <em>P<sub>new</sub></em>: since the startup
      has no existing profit to replace, the rewards to innovation are higher. Thus
      innovation is more appealing for those without any economic stake in the status
      quo.<a href=\\\"#fn1\\\"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>We can see this play out today

      monopoly in search, and so is hesitant to replace what they have, whereas Microsoft
      has already been losing in search and so is eager to replace Bing with <s>Sydney</s>
      an AI-powered alternative. (It\u2019s to Apple\u2019s credit that they so eagerly
      pursued the iPhone when it meant effectively destroying the iPod, one of their
      top money-makers.<a href=\\\"#fn2\\\"><sup>2</sup></a>)</p><p>One can also see
      this scenario in academia\u2014plenty of established labs have programs built
      up around studying specific systems, and are thus disincentivized to study areas
      which might obviate projects they\u2019ve spent decades working on. For instance,
      labs dedicated to \u201Cconventional\u201D synthetic methodology might be slower
      to turn to biocatalysis than a new assistant professor with nothing to lose;
      labs that have spent decades studying protein folding might be slower to turn
      to AlphaFold than they ought to.</p><p>Another reason is that new entrants often
      have an advantage in understanding the status quo. In <em>The Art of Doing Science
      and Engineering</em> (book review coming, eventually), computing legend <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming\\\">Richard
      Hamming</a> discusses how there\u2019s often a disadvantage to being a pioneer
      in a field. Hamming\u2019s argument, essentially, is that those who\u2019ve
      had to invent something new never understand it as intuitively as those who
      have simply learned to take it for granted:</p><blockquote><p>The reason this
      happens is that the creators have to fight through so many dark difficulties,
      and wade through so much misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the
      light as others can, now the door is open and the path made easy\u2026. in time
      the same will probably be true of you.</p></blockquote><p>In Hamming\u2019s
      view, it\u2019s the latecomers to a field who can see more clearly the new possibilities
      opened by various innovations, and take the next steps towards previously unimaginable
      frontiers. There\u2019s a deep irony in this: the very act of inventing something
      new makes you less able to see the innovations enabled by your own work. The
      process of invention thus acts like a relay race, where newer generations continually
      take the baton and push things forward before in turn dropping back.</p><p>I\u2019ve
      heard these ideas discussed in terms of na\xEFvete before\u2014the idea being
      that innovation requires a sort of \u201Cbeginner\u2019s luck,\u201D a blind
      optimism about what\u2019s possible that the experienced lack\u2014but I think
      that\u2019s wrong. A belief in na\xEFvete as the key driver of innovation implies
      that excessive knowledge is detrimental: that it\u2019s possible to \u201Cknow
      too much\u201D and cripple oneself. If anything, the opposite is true in my
      experience. The most creative and productive people I\u2019ve met are those
      with an utter mastery of the knowledge in their domain.</p><p>Hamming\u2019s
      proposal, which is more cognitive/subconscious, is thus complementary to the
      more calculated logic of the Arrow replacement theorem: existing organizations
      are both less incentivized to innovate and less able to see potential innovations.
      These ideas should be encouraging to anyone at the beginning of their career:
      you are uniquely poised to discover and exploit new opportunities! So consider
      this an exhortation to go out and do so now (rather than waiting until you are
      older and more secure in your field).</p><p><em>Credit to <a href=\\\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/04/the-arrow-replacement-effect-and-the-dynamics-of-us-inventors.html?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-arrow-replacement-effect-and-the-dynamics-of-us-inventors\\\">Alex

      are aligned towards publishing papers, and lots of papers get published.</p><p>In
      contrast, the success or failure of a private company is\u2014to a first approximation\u2014unrelated
      to its publication record. Indeed, publication might even be harmful for companies,
      insofar as time spent preparing manuscripts and acquiring data <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html\\\">only
      needed for publication</a> is time that could be spent on more mission-critical
      activities.</p><p>That\u2019s why I generally believe industry publications,
      especially those where no academic co-authors are involved, are underrated,
      and are probably better than the journal they\u2019re in might indicate. Getting
      a publication into a prestigious journal like <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em>
      is pretty random, requires a lot of effort, and frequently has a slow turnaround
      time, whereas lower-tier journals are likely to accept your work, and typically
      review and publish papers much, much faster. (In particular, ACS is <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/11/08/guest-post-publishing-fast-and-slow-a-review-of-publishing-speed-in-the-last-decade/\\\">among
      the fastest of all scientific publishers</a>, and is generally a pleasure to
      work with.)</p><p>The above reflections were prompted by reading <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00452\\\">an
      absolute gem of a paper</a> in <em>J. Med. Chem.</em>, a collaboration between
      X-Chem, ZebiAI, and Google Research. The paper is entitled \u201CMachine Learning
      on DNA-Encoded Libraries: A New Paradigm for Hit Finding\u201D and describes
      how data from DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) can be used to train ML models to
      predict commercially available compounds with activity against a given target.
      This is a really, really big deal. As the authors put it in their conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>[Our
      approach] avoids the time-consuming and expensive process of building new chemical
      matter into a DEL library and performing new selections or incorporating new
      molecules into a HTS screening library. This ability to consider compounds outside
      of the DEL is the biggest advantage of our approach; notably, this approach
      can be used at a fraction of the cost of a traditional DEL screening follow-up,
      driven primarily by the large difference in synthesis cost.</p></blockquote><p>Now,
      the precise impact of this discovery will of course be determined in the years
      to come; Derek Lowe raises some fair concerns <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/machine-learning-top-dna-encoded-libraries\\\">on
      his blog</a>, pointing out that the targets chosen are relatively easy to drug,
      and so probably wouldn\u2019t be the subject of a high-tech DEL screen anyway,
      and it\u2019s entirely possible that there will be other unforeseen complications
      with this technology that are only revealed in the context of a real-world discovery
      pipeline. (Given that Relay <a href=\\\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/relay-acquire-zebiai-ai-drug-discovery/598550/\\\">acquired
      ZebiAI</a> for $85M in 2021 essentially on the strength of this paper alone,
      I\u2019m guessing plenty of real-world testing is already underway.)</p><p>The
      point I want to make is that if this paper had come from an academic group,
      I would be very, very surprised to see it in <em>J. Med Chem</em>. This project
      has everything that one expects in a <em>Science</em> paper: a flashy new piece
      of technology, a problem that\u2019s understandable to a broad audience, clear
      clincal relevance, even a domain arbitrage angle. Yet this paper is not in <em>Science</em>,
      nor <em>ACS Central Science</em>, nor even <em>JACS</em>, but in <em>J. Med.
      Chem.</em>, a journal I don\u2019t even read regularly.</p><p>My conclusions
      from this are (1) to remember that not everyone is incentivized to market their
      own findings as strongly as academics are and (2) to try and look out for less-hyped
      industry results that I might neglect otherwise.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"While

      You Should Read The Literature More</h2><p>You should read the literature because
      you are a scientist, and your business is ideas. The literature is the vast,
      messy, primal chaos that contains centuries of scientific ideas. If you are
      an ideas worker, this is your raw material\u2014this is what you work with.
      Not reading the literature as an ideas worker is like not going to new restaurants
      as a new chef, or not looking at other people\u2019s art as an artist, or not
      listening to music as a composer. Maybe the rare person has an internal creativity
      so deep that they don\u2019t need any external sources of inspiration, but I\u2019m
      not sure I know anyone like that.</p><p>If you buy the concept of <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230320_domain_arbitrage.html\\\">\u201Cdomain
      arbitrage\u201D</a> I outlined last week, then reading the literature becomes
      doubly important for up-and-coming arbitrageurs. Not only do you need to stay
      on top of research in your own field, but you also need to keep an eye on other
      fields, to look for unexpected connections. It was only after months of reading
      physical chemistry papers about various IR spectroscopy techniques, with no
      direct goal in mind, that I realized I could use <em>in situ</em> IR to <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03622\\\">pin
      down the structure of ethereal HCl</a>; simply reading organic chemistry papers
      would not have given me that insight.</p><h2>How You Can Read The Literature
      More</h2><p>If you don\u2019t read the literature at all\u2014like me, when
      I started undergrad\u2014then you should start small. I usually recommend <em>JACS</em>
      to chemists. Just try to read every paper in your subfield in <em>JACS</em>
      for a few months; I began by trying to read every organic chemistry paper in
      <em>JACS</em>. At the beginning, probably only 10\u201320% will make sense.
      But if you push through and keep trying to make sense of things, eventually
      it will get easier. You\u2019ll start to see the same experiments repeated,
      understand the structure of different types of papers, and even recognize certain
      turns of phrase. (This happened to me after about a year and a half of reading
      the literature.)</p><p>Reading more papers makes you a faster reader. Here\u2019s
      <a href=\\\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/how_to_read_fas.html\\\">Tyler
      Cowen</a> on how he reads so quickly (not papers specifically, but still applicable):</p><blockquote><p>The
      best way to read quickly is to read lots. And lots. And to have started a long
      time ago. Then maybe you know what is coming in the current book. Reading quickly
      is often, in a margin-relevant way, close to not reading much at all. <br><br>Note
      that when you add up the time costs of reading lots, quick readers don\u2019t
      consume information as efficiently as you might think. They\u2019ve chosen a
      path with high upfront costs and low marginal costs. \\\"It took me 44 years
      to read this book\\\" is not a bad answer to many questions about reading speed.</p></blockquote><p>All
      of Tyler\u2019s advice applies doubly to scientific writing, which is often
      jargon-filled and ordered in arcane ways. After 7ish years of reading the scientific
      literature, I can \u201Cskim\u201D a <em>JACS</em> paper pretty quickly and
      determine what, if anything, is likely to be novel or interesting to me, which
      makes staying on top of the literature much easier than it used to be.</p><p>Once
      you are good with a single journal, you can expand to multiple journals. A good
      starting set for organic chemistry is <em>JACS</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em>,
      <em>Nature Chemistry</em>, and <em>Angewandte</em>. If you already know how
      to read papers quickly, it will not be very hard to read more and more papers.
      But expanding to new journals brings challenges: how do you keep up with all
      of them at once? Lots of people use an RSS feed to aggregate different journals\u2014I
      use <a href=\\\"https://feedly.com/\\\">Feedly</a>, as do several of my coworkers.
      (You can also get this blog on Feedly!)</p><p>I typically check Feedly many
      times a day on my phone; I can look at the TOC graphic, the abstract, and the
      title, and then if I like how the paper looks I\u2019ll email it to myself.
      Every other day or so, I sit down at my computer with a cup of coffee and read
      through the papers I\u2019ve emailed to myself. This is separate from my \u201Cpursuing

      also use Google Scholar Alerts to email me when new labs publish results\u2014I
      have probably 20-30 labs set up this way, just to make sure I don\u2019t miss
      results that might be important just because they\u2019re not in a high-profile
      journal.)</p><p>Keeping track of papers you actually like and want to remember

      think about literature results in three categories:</p><ol><li><p>Things every
      scientist should know about</p></li><li><p>Things I am supposed to be an expert
      on</p></li><li><p>Things I\u2019m not supposed to be an expert on, but would
      still like to know about</p></li></ol><p>Category 1 basically covers the highest
      profile results (<em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em>), and these days Twitter
      makes that pretty easy.</p><p>Category 2 covers things \u201Cin-field\u201D
      or directly related to my projects\u2014anything it would be somewhat embarrassing
      not to know about. For me, this means <em>JACS</em>, <em>Angewandte</em>, <em>ACS
      Catalysis</em>, <em>Org. Lett.</em>, <em>OPRD</em>, <em>Organometallics</em>,
      <em>J. Org. Chem.</em>, and <em>Chem. Sci.</em> (I also follow <em>Chem. Rev.</em>
      and <em>Chem. Soc. Rev.</em>, because review articles are nice.)</p><p>Category
      3 covers things that I am excited to learn about. Right now, that\u2019s <em>JCTC</em>
      and <em>J. Phys. Chem. A\u2013C</em>. In the past, that\u2019s included <em>ACS
      Chem. Bio.</em>, <em>Nature Chem. Bio.</em>, and <em>Inorganic Chemistry</em>.
      (Writing this piece made me realize I should follow <em>JCIM</em> and <em>J.
      Chem. Phys.</em>, so I just added them to Feedly.)</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Reading
      the literature is\u2014in the short term\u2014pointless, sometimes frustrating,
      and just a waste of time. It\u2019s rare that the article you read today will
      lead to an insight on the problem you\u2019re currently facing! But the gains
      to knowledge compound over time, so spending time reading the literature today

      the idea of \u201Cdomain arbitrage.\u201D<a href=\\\"#fn1\\\"><sup>1</sup></a>
      Arbitrage, in economics, is taking advantage of price differences in different
      markets: if bread costs $7 in Cambridge but $4 in Boston, I can buy in Boston,
      sell in Cambridge, and pocket the difference. Since this is easy and requires
      very little from the arbitrageur, physical markets typically lack opportunities
      for substantial arbitrage. In this case, the efficient market hypothesis works
      well.</p><p>Knowledge markets, however, are much less efficient than physical
      markets\u2014many skills which are cheap in a certain domain are expensive in
      other domains. For instance, fields that employ organic synthesis, like chemical
      biology or polymer chemistry, have much less synthetic expertise than actual
      organic synthesis groups. The knowledge of how to use a Schlenk line properly
      is cheap within organic chemistry but expensive everywhere else. And organic
      chemists certainly don\u2019t have a monopoly on scarce skills: trained computer
      scientists are very scarce in most scientific fields, as are statisticians,
      despite the growing importance of software and statistics to almost every area
      of research.</p><p>Domain arbitrage, then, is taking knowledge that\u2019s cheap
      in one domain to a domain where it\u2019s expensive, and profiting from the
      difference. I like this term better because it doesn\u2019t imply that the goal
      of the research has to be interdisciplinary\u2014instead, you\u2019re solving
      problems that people have always wanted to solve, just now with innovative methods.
      And the concept of arbitrage highlights how this can be beneficial for the practitioner.
      You\u2019re bringing new insights to your field so you can help your own research
      and make cool discoveries, not because you\u2019ve been told that interdisciplinary
      work is good in an abstract way.</p><p>There are many examples of domain arbitrage,<a
      href=\\\"#fn2\\\"><sup>2</sup></a> but perhaps my favorite is the recent black
      hole image, which was largely due to work by Katie Bouman (formerly a graduate

      telescope data by Bouman\u2019s new algorithms.</figcaption></figure></div><p>What\u2019s
      surprising is that Bouman didn\u2019t have a background in astronomy at all:
      she \u201Chardly knew what a black hole was\u201D (<a href=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/katie-bouman-hardly-knew-what-a-black-hole-was-her-algorithm-helped-us-see-one\\\">in
      her words</a>) when she started working on the project. Instead, Bouman\u2019s
      work drew on her background in computer vision, adapting statistical image models
      to the task of reconstructing astronomical images. In <a href=\\\"https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Bouman_Computational_Imaging_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf\\\">a
      2016 paper</a>, she explicitly credits computer vision with the insights that
      would later lead to the black hole image, and concludes by stating that \u201Castronomical
      imaging will benefit from the crossfertilization of ideas with the computer
      vision community.\u201D</p><p>If we accept that domain arbitrage is important,
      why doesn\u2019t it happen more often? I can think of a few reasons: some fundamental,
      some structural, and some cultural. On the fundamental level, domain arbitrage
      requires knowledge of two fields of research at a more-than-superficial level.
      This is relatively common for adjacent fields of research (like organic chemistry
      and inorganic chemistry), but becomes increasingly rare as the distance between
      the two fields grows. It\u2019s not enough to just try and read journals from
      other fields occasionally\u2014without the proper context, other fields are
      simply unintelligible. Given how hard achieving competence in a single area
      of study can be, we should not be surprised that those with a working knowledge
      of multiple fields are so scarce.</p><p>The structure of our research institutions
      also makes domain arbitrage harder. In theory, a 15-person research group could
      house scientists from a variety of backgrounds: chemists, biologists, mathematicians,
      engineers, and so forth, all focused on a common research goal. In practice,
      the high rate of turnover in academic positions makes this challenging. Graduate
      students are only around for 5\u20136 years, postdocs for fewer, and both positions
      are typically filled by people hoping to learn things, not by already competent
      researchers. Thus, senior lab members must constantly train newer members in
      various techniques, skills, and ways of thinking so that institutional knowledge
      can be preserved.</p><p>This is hard but doable for a single area of research,
      but quickly becomes untenable as the number of fields increases. A lab working
      in two fields has to pass down twice as much knowledge, with the same rate of
      personnel turnover. In practice, this often means that students end up deficient
      in one (or both) fields. As Derek Lowe put it <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pipeline-1060\\\">when
      discussing chemical biology</a> in 2007:</p><blockquote><p>I find a lot of [chemical
      biology] very interesting (though not invariably), and some of it looks like
      it could lead to useful and important things. My worry, though, is: what happens
      to the grad students who do this stuff? They run the risk of spending too much
      time on biology to be completely competent chemists, and vice versa.</p></blockquote><p>To
      me, this seems like a case in which the two goals of the research university\u2014to
      teach students and to produce research\u2014are at odds. It\u2019s easier to
      teach students in single-domain labs, but the research that comes from multiple
      domains is superior. It\u2019s not easy to think about how to address this without
      fundamental change to the structure of universities (although perhaps others
      have more creative proposals than I).<a href=\\\"#fn3\\\"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>But,
      perhaps most frustratingly, cultural factors also contribute to the rarity of
      domain arbitrage. Many scientific disciplines today define themselves not by
      the questions they\u2019re trying to solve but by the methods they employ, which
      disincentivizes developing innovative methods. For example, many organic chemists
      feel that biocatalysis shouldn\u2019t be considered organic synthesis, since
      it employs enzymes and cofactors instead of more traditional catalysts and reagents,
      even though organic synthesis and biocatalysis both address the same goal: making
      molecules. While it\u2019s somewhat inevitable that years of lab work leaves
      one with a certain affection for the methods one employs, it\u2019s also irrational.</p><p>Now,
      one might reasonably argue that precisely delimiting where one scientific field
      begins and another ends is a pointless exercise. Who\u2019s to say whether biocatalysis
      is better viewed as the domain of organic chemistry or biochemistry? While this
      is fair, it\u2019s also true that the scientific field one formally belongs
      to matters a great deal. If society deems me an organic chemist, then overwhelmingly
      it is other organic chemists who will decide if I get a PhD, if I obtain tenure
      as a professor, and if my proposals are funded.<a href=\\\"#fn4\\\"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>Given
      that the success or failure of my scientific career thus depends on the opinion
      of other organic chemists, it starts to become apparent why domain arbitrage
      is difficult. If I attempt to solve problems in organic chemistry by introducing
      techniques from another field, it\u2019s likely that my peers will be confused
      or skeptical by my work, and hesitate to accept it as \u201Creal\u201D organic
      chemistry (see, for instance, the biocatalysis scenario above). Conversely,
      if I attempt to solve problems in other domains with the tools of organic chemistry,
      my peers will likely be uninterested in the outcome of the research, even if
      they approve of the methods employed. So from either angle domain arbitrage
      is disfavored.</p><p>The factors discussed here don\u2019t serve to completely
      halt domain arbitrage, as successful arbitrageurs like Katie Bouman or Frances
      Arnold demonstrate, but they do act to inhibit it. If we accept the claim that
      domain arbitrage is good, and we should be working to make it more common, what
      then should we do to address these problems? One could envision a number of
      structural solutions, which I won\u2019t get into here, but on a personal level
      the conclusion is obvious: if you care about performing cutting-edge research,
      it\u2019s important to learn things outside the narrow area that you specialize
      in and not silo yourself within a single discipline.</p><p><em> Thanks to Shlomo

      to assign the relative configuration of some tricky diastereomers, which has
      led me to do a bit of a deep dive into the world of computational NMR prediction.
      Having spent the last week or so researching the current state-of-the-art in
      simulating experimental <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, I\u2019m excited to share
      some of my findings.</p><p>My main resource in this quest has been <a href=\\\"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/6/2449\\\">a
      new NMR benchmarking paper</a>, published on March 7th by authors from Merck
      (and a few other places). Why this paper in particular? Although there have
      been many NMR benchmarks, not all of these papers are as useful as they seem.
      Broadly speaking, there are two ways to benchmark NMR shifts: (1) against high-level
      computed results or (2) against experimental NMR shifts.</p><p>The first strategy
      seems to be popular with theoretical chemists: NMR shifts at a very high level
      of theory are presumably very accurate, and so if we can just reproduce those
      values with a cheap method, we will have solved the NMR prediction problem.
      Of course, effects due to solvation and vibrational motion will be ignored,
      but these effects can always be corrected for later. In contrast, the second
      strategy is more useful for experimental chemists: if the calculation is going
      to be compared to experimental NMR spectra in CDCl<sub>3</sub> solution, the
      match with experiment is much more important than the gas-phase accuracy of
      the functional employed.</p><p>Not only are these two approaches different in
      theory, they yield vastly different results in practice, as is nicely illustrated
      by the case of the double-hybrid functional DSD-PBEP86. DSD-PBEP86 was <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00624\\\">first
      reported in 2018</a> by Frank Neese and coworkers, who found it to be much superior
      to regular DFT methods or MP2-type wavefunction methods at reproducing CCSD(T)
      reference data.<a href=\\\"#fn1\\\"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00919\\\">A
      subsequent benchmark</a> by Kaupp and coworkers looked at a much larger set
      of compounds and confirmed that DSD-PBEP86 was indeed superior at reproducing
      CCSD(T) data, with a mean absolute error (MAE) for <sup>1</sup>H of 0.06 ppm.
      In contrast, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00604\\\">de
      Oliveira and coworkers</a> found that DSD-PBEP86 and related double-hybrid methods
      were much worse at predicting experimental <sup>1</sup>H NMR shifts, with a
      MAE of 0.20 ppm, making them no better than conventional DFT approaches.</p><p>
      The difference between these two mindsets is nicely demonstrated by Kaupp\u2019s
      paper, which dismisses de Oliveira\u2019s work as suffering from \u201Cmethodological
      inadequacies\u201D and states:</p><blockquote><p>[Benchmarking] can be done
      by comparing approximative calculations to experimental data or to data computed
      using high-level ab initio methodologies. The latter helps to eliminate a number
      of factors that often complicate the direct comparison against experiment, such
      as environmental, ro-vibrational, or thermal contributions (possibly also relativistic
      effects, see below).</p></blockquote><p>While Kaupp is correct that using gas-phase
      CCSD(T) data does eliminate \u201Cenvironmental\u201D effects (e.g. from solvent),
      it\u2019s not clear that these effects always ought to be eliminated! Although
      directly optimizing a computational method to reproduce a bunch of ill-defined
      environmental effects is perhaps inelegant, it\u2019s certainly pragmatic.</p><p>The
      authors of the 2023 benchmark create a new set of well-behaved reference compounds
      that avoid troublesome heavy-atom effects (poorly handled by most conventional
      calculations) or low-lying conformational equilibria, and re-acquire experimental
      spectra (in chloroform) for every compound in the set. They then score a wide
      variety of computational methods against this dataset: functionals, basis sets,
      implicit solvent methods, and more.</p><p>In the end, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct6001016\\\">Cramer\u2019s
      WP04 functional</a> is found to be best, which is perhaps unsurprising given
      that it was specifically optimized for the prediction of <sup>1</sup>H shifts
      in chloroform.<a href=\\\"#fn2\\\"><sup>2</sup></a> The WP04/6-311++G(2d,p)/PCM(chloroform)
      level of theory is optima, giving an MAE of 0.08 ppm against experiment, but
      WP04/jul-CC-PVDZ/PCM(chloroform) is cheaper and not much worse. B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)
      works fine for geometry optimization, as do wB97X-D/6-31G(d) and M06-2X/6-31G(d).</p><p>Based
      on these results, my final workflow for predicting experimental proton spectra
      is:</p><ol><li><p><a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221219_low_code_csearch.html\\\">Run

      weighting</a>, and apply a linear correction.</p></li></ol><p>For small molecules,
      this workflow runs extremely quickly (just a few hours from start to finish),
      and has produced good-quality results that solved the problem I was trying to
      solve.</p><p>Nevertheless, the theoreticians have a point\u2014although WP04
      can account for a lot of environmental effects (essentially by overfitting to
      experimental data), there are plenty of systems for which this pragmatic approach
      cannot succeed. For instance, the DELTA50 dataset intentionally excludes molecules
      which might exhibit concentration-dependent aggregation behavior, which includes
      basically anything capable of hydrogen bonding or \u03C0\u2013\u03C0 stacking!
      If we hope to get beyond a certain level of accuracy, it seems likely that physically
      correct models of NMR shieldings, solvent effects, and aggregation will be necessary.</p><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol><li><p>CCSD(T)

      of us who like programming in Python, there are a number of different ways to
      make Python code faster. The simplest way is just to use NumPy, the <em>de facto</em>

      are written in C/C++, and so are much faster than the corresponding native Python

      Python code, like Jax or Numba. This approach incurs a substantial <em>O</em>(1)
      cost (compilation) but makes all subsequent calls orders of magnitude faster.

      this case, it\u2019s pretty obvious that we should just use cdist. But what
      if there wasn\u2019t a magic built-in function for this task\u2014how close
      can we get to the performance of cdist with other performance optimizations?</p><p>The
      first and most obvious optimization is simply to take advantage of the symmetry
      of the matrix, and not compute entries below the diagonal. (Note that this is
      sort of cheating, since cdist doesn\u2019t know that both arguments are the
      same.)</p><pre><code>def triangle_get_distance(points):\\n    N = points.shape[0]\\n

      j in range(i,N):\\n            distances[i,j] = np.linalg.norm(points[i]-points[j])\\n
      \           distances[j,i] = distances[i,j]\\n    return distances\\n</code></pre><p>As
      expected, this roughly halves our time:</p><pre><code>%%timeit\\ntriangle_get_distance(points)\\n\\n57.6
      ms \xB1 409 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\\n</code></pre><p>Next,
      we can use Numba to compile this function. This yields roughly a 10-fold speedup,
      bringing us to about two orders of magnitude slower than cdist.</p><pre><code>numba_triangle_get_distance
      = numba.njit(triangle_get_distance)\\n</code></pre><pre><code>%%timeit\\nnumba_triangle_get_distance(points)\\n\\n5.74
      ms \xB1 36.2 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\\n</code></pre><p>Defining
      our own norm with Numba, instead of using np.linalg.norm, gives us another nice
      boost:</p><pre><code>def custom_norm(AB):\\n    return np.sqrt(AB[0]*AB[0] +

      ms \xB1 21.6 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\\n</code></pre><p>What
      about trying to write this program using only vectorized NumPy functions? This
      takes a bit more creativity; I came up with the following function, which is
      a bit memory-inefficient but still runs quite quickly:</p><pre><code>def numpy_get_distance(points):\\n

      \   sq_diff = np.square(np.subtract(points_row, points_col))\\n    return np.sqrt(np.sum(sq_diff,

      calling np.repeat with arguments <a href=\\\"https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html\\\">isn\u2019t
      supported by Numba</a>, meaning that I had to get a bit more creative to write
      a Numba-compilable version of the previous program. The best solution that I
      found involved a few array reshaping operations, which are (presumably) pretty
      inefficient, and the final code only runs a little bit faster than the Numpy-only
      version.</p><pre><code>def numpy_get_distance2(points):\\n    N = points.shape[0]\\n\\n
      \   points_row = np.swapaxes(points.repeat(N).reshape((N,3,N)),1,2)\\n    points_col
      = np.swapaxes(points_row,0,1)\\n\\n    sq_diff = np.square(np.subtract(points_row,
      points_col))\\n    return np.sqrt(np.sum(sq_diff, axis=2))\\n\\nnumba_np_get_distance2

      tried a few other approaches, but ultimately wasn\u2019t able to find anything
      better; in theory, splitting the loops into chunks could improve cache utilization,
      but in practice anything clever I tried just made things slower.</p><p>In the
      end, we were able to accelerate our code about 250x by using a combination of
      NumPy and Numba, but were unable to match the speed of an optimized low-level
      implementation. Maybe in a future post I\u2019ll drop into C or C++ and see
      how close I can get to the reference\u2014until then, I hope you found this
      useful.</p><p>(I\u2019m sure that there are ways that even this Python version

      were lightbulbs the only thing Langmuir studied at GE: he invented a greatly
      improved form of vacuum pump, invented a hydrogen welding process used to construct
      vacuum-tight seals, and employed thin films of molecules on water to determine
      accurate molecular sizes with unprecedented accuracy. Gilliam argues that this
      tremendous productivity can in part be attributed to the fact that Langmuir\u2019s
      work was in constant contact with practical problems, which served as a source
      of scientific inspiration:</p><blockquote><p>In a developed world that is not
      exactly beset by scarcity and hardship anymore, it is hard to come up with the
      best areas to explore out of thin air. Pain points are not often obvious. Fundamental
      researchers can benefit massively from going to a lab mostly dedicated to making
      practical improvements to things like light bulbs and pumps and observing/asking
      questions. It is, frankly, odd that we normalized a system in which so many
      of our fundamental STEM researchers are allowed to grow so disjoint from the
      applied aspects of their field in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>And <a
      href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/16349\\\">Langmuir himself</a> seems to
      agree:</p><blockquote><p>As [the GE] laboratory developed it was soon recognized
      that it was not practicable nor desirable that such a laboratory should be engaged
      wholly in fundamental scientific research. It was found that at least 75 per
      cent of the laboratory must be devoted to the development of the practical applications.
      It is stimulating to the men engaged in fundamental science to be in contact
      with those primarily interested in the practical applications.</p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s
      bring in our second thinker. Last weekend, I had the privilege of attending
      a lecture by Johnathan Bi on Rene Girard and the philosophy of innovation, which
      discussed (among other things) how a desire for \u201Cdisruption\u201D above
      all else actually makes innovation more difficult. To quote Girard\u2019s <a
      href=\\\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3684663\\\">\u201CInnovation and Repetition,\u201D</a>
      which Bi discussed at length:</p><blockquote><p>The main prerequisite for real
      innovation is a minimal respect for the past and the mastery of its achievements,
      i.e., mimesis. To expect novelty to cleanse itself of imitation is to expect
      a plant to grow with its roots up in the air. In the long run, the obligation
      always to rebel may be more destructive of novelty than the obligation never
      to rebel.</p></blockquote><p>What does this mean? Girard is describing two ways
      in which innovation can fail. The first is quite intuitive\u2014if we hew to
      tradition too much, if we have an excessive respect for the past and not a \u201Cminimal
      respect,\u201D we\u2019ll be afraid to innovate. This is the oft-derided state
      of stagnation.</p><p>The second way in which we can fail to innovate, however,
      is a bit more subtle. Girard is saying that innovation also requires a mastery
      of the past\u2019s achievements; we can\u2019t simply ignore tradition, we have
      to understand what exists before we can innovate on top of it. Otherwise we
      will be, in Girard\u2019s words, like a plant \u201Cwith its roots up in the
      air.\u201D All innovation has to occur within its proper context\u2014to quote
      Tyler Cowen, <a href=\\\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html\\\">\u201Ccontext
      is that which is scarce.\u201D</a></p><p>This might seem a little silly. Innovation,
      \u201Cthe introduction of new things, ideas or ways of doing something\u201D
      (<a href=\\\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/innovation\\\">Oxford</a>),
      at first inspection seems not to depend on tradition at all. But novelty with
      no hope of improvement over the status quo is simply a cry for attention; wearing
      one\u2019s shoes on the wrong feet may be unusual, but is unlikely to win one
      renown as a great innovator.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      class=\\\"image-caption\\\">When innovation, devoid of context, becomes the
      highest virtue... (I added this to the post a few hours late, sorry.)</figcaption></figure></div><p>What
      does this mean for scientific innovation, and how does this connect to Gilliam\u2019s
      thoughts about Langmuir and the GE Research Laboratory? I\u2019d argue that
      much of our fundamental research today, even that which is novel, lacks the
      context necessary to be transformatively innovative. Often the most impactful
      discoveries aren\u2019t those which self-consciously aim to be <em>Science</em>
      or <em>Nature</em> papers, but those which simply aim to address outstanding
      problems or investigate anomalies. For instance, our own lab\u2019s interest
      in hydrogen-bond-donor organocatalysis <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja980139y\\\">was
      initiated</a> by the unexpected discovery that omitting the metal from an ostensibly
      metal-catalyzed Strecker reaction increased the enantioselectivity. Girard again:</p><blockquote><p>The
      principle of originality at all costs leads to paralysis. The more we celebrate
      \\\"creative and enriching\\\" innovations, the fewer of them there are.</p></blockquote><p>Langmuir\u2019s
      example shows us a different path towards innovation. If we set out to investigate
      and address real-world problems of known practical import, without innovation
      in mind, Gilliam and Girard argue that we\u2019ll be more innovative than if
      we make innovation our explicit goal. I don\u2019t have a concrete policy recommendation
      to share here, but some of my other blog posts on <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220907_mit_elegy.html\\\">applied
      research at MIT</a> and <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html\\\">the
      importance of engineering</a> perhaps hint at what positive change might look
      like.</p><p><em> In accordance with the themes of this piece, my interpretation
      of Girard pretty much comes straight from Johnathan Bi. He has a lecture on
      Youtube where he discusses these ideas: <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/qdWHcBBCaww?t=3906\\\">here\u2019s

      reality, every simulation is somewhere between these two limiting extremes.
      No matter how hard you try, a properly executed DFT calculation will not predict
      formation of a methyl cation to be a low-barrier process\u2014the computational
      method used understands enough chemistry to rule this out, even if the user
      does not. On the flip side, even the most sophisticated calculations all involve
      some form of human insight or intuition, either explicitly or implicitly. We\u2019re
      still very far away from the point where we can ask the computer to generate
      the structures of new catalysts (or medicines) and expect reasonable, trustworthy
      results. But that\u2019s ok; there\u2019s a lot to be gained from lesser calculations!
      There\u2019s no shame in generating computational models instead of oracles.</p><p>What\u2019s
      crucial, though, is to make sure that everyone\u2014practitioners, experimentalists,
      and readers\u2014understands where a given calculation falls on the model\u2013oracle
      continuum. An expert might understand that a semiempirical AIMD study of reaction
      dynamics is likely to be only qualitatively correct (if that), but does the
      casual reader? I\u2019ve talked to an unfortunate number of experimental chemists
      who think a single DFT picture means that we can \u201Cpredict better catalysts,\u201D
      as if that were a button in GaussView. The appeal of oracles is seductive, and
      we have to be clear when we\u2019re presenting models instead. (This ties into

      work</a> on automated design of catalysts for the Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillman
      reaction. The authors use a generative model to discover tertiary amines with
      lower DFT-computed barriers than DABCO (the usual catalyst), and then experimentally
      validate one of their candidates, finding that it is indeed almost an order-of-magnitude
      faster than DABCO. It\u2019s difficult to underscore how groundbreaking this
      result is; as the authors dryly note, \u201CWe believe this is the first experimentally
      verified <em>de novo</em> discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative
      model.\u201D On the spectrum discussed above, this is getting pretty close to

      (science) and settling already-explored territory (engineering).</p><p>These
      thoughts seem broadly consistent with what others think. Boston University\u2019s
      <a href=\\\"https://www.bu.edu/eng/about-eng/meet-the-dean/engineering-is-not-science/\\\">College
      of Engineering</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>Engineers are not a sub-category
      of scientists. So often the two terms are used interchangeably, but they are
      separate, albeit related, disciplines. Scientists explore the natural world
      and show us how and why it is as it is. Discovery is the essence of science.
      Engineers innovate solutions to real-world challenges in society. While it is
      true that engineering without science could be haphazard; without engineering,
      scientific discovery would be a merely an academic pursuit.</p></blockquote><p>And
      the <a href=\\\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/press-room/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-engineering\\\">National
      Society of Professional Engineers</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>Science is knowledge
      based on observed facts and tested truths arranged in an orderly system that
      can be validated and communicated to other people. Engineering is the creative
      application of scientific principles used to plan, build, direct, guide, manage,
      or work on systems to maintain and improve our daily lives.</p></blockquote><p>As
      I\u2019ve started thinking more about the structure of the modern research system,
      and what its proper scope and purpose should be, I\u2019ve grown increasingly
      skeptical of these distinctions. The claim I want to make in this post is that,
      following the above definitions of engineering, most chemistry is engineering.
      I don\u2019t think this is bad! In fact, I think that many chemists could benefit
      from borrowing from an engineering mindset, and should consider incorporating
      this perspective in their self-conception.</p><h2>Much of Organic Chemistry
      is Engineering</h2><p>I want to return to the BU and NSPE definitions, because
      I think they\u2019re concise and well-written, and take as gospel that scientists
      \u201Cexplore the natural world and show us how and why it is as it is,\u201D
      while engineers \u201Cinnovate solutions to real-world challenges in society\u201D
      (we\u2019ll revisit issues of definition later). In short, developing something
      you want other people to use makes you an engineer. Which branches of modern
      organic chemistry are science, and which are engineering?</p><p>Method development\u2014one
      of my core interests\u2014seems like a good candidate for \u201Cengineering.\u201D
      Researchers in this space identify unsolved problems in organic synthesis, develop
      methods or catalysts to solve these problems, and then (in many cases) advertise,
      license, &amp; sell their solutions to consumers! (If you don\u2019t believe
      me, just look at the <a href=\\\"https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/collections/professor-product-portal\\\">\u201COrganic
      Synthesis\u201D tab</a> of the Sigma-Aldrich Professor Product Portal.) If these
      products weren\u2019t molecules and were instead mechanical gadgets, nothing
      about this would be obviously scientific.</p><p>And the problems chosen are
      identified almost purely on the basis of what might be useful to potential users.
      There\u2019s no clearer illustration of this than the recent gold rush to identify
      synthetic routes to bicyclic arene bioisosteres, which are useful in medicinal
      chemistry. Five years ago, I can\u2019t think of a single paper making these
      compounds; now, I can find nine in high-profile journals just from the past
      year or so (<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05290-z.pdf\\\">1</a>,

      and physical organic chemistry\u2014another love of mine\u2014present a tougher
      case, since in most cases the outcome of the studies is only knowledge. But
      I\u2019m still not sure that this makes this field scientific! Let me illustrate
      why with an example.</p><p>An automotive engineer may be confused by why a given
      transmission is not working. He/she may formulate a hypothesis, take the transmission
      apart, perform various experiments on its constituent pieces, validate or disprove
      the initial hypothesis, and generally conduct a thorough mechanistic investigation
      to understand the origin of the problem. But does that make him/her a scientist?</p><p>The
      answer, I think, is no. The subject matter is not scientific, so no amount of
      scientific thinking can make the work science. Similarly, I\u2019d argue that
      investigating the mechanism of a system invented and developed by humans\u2014like
      a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction\u2014doesn\u2019t count as science. (Does
      application of the scientific method automatically make one a scientist? See
      below for a continued discussion.)</p><p>In contrast, something that I think
      is a truly scientific area of investigation is the study of enzyme structure
      and function. Despite extensive study and many Nobel prizes, we\u2019re still
      learning about how enzymes operate and how they achieve such extraordinary reactivity
      and selectivity. (For an example of this sort of work, see Arieh Warshel\u2019s
      <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr0503106\\\">review</a> on
      electrostatic effects in enzyme catalysis, and references therein.)</p><p>I
      don\u2019t think I understand all areas of chemistry well enough to fairly judge
      whether they\u2019re better understood as engineering or science, so I\u2019ll
      leave this as an exercise to the reader: What motivates your research? Are you
      mainly driven by a desire to understand the natural order of things, or do you
      aim to develop technology to make the world better? Both are important, and
      neither answer is bad\u2014but if your main goal is inventing a new molecule,
      material, algorithm, or medicine, you might consider thinking of yourself as
      more of an engineer than a scientist.</p><h2>Do Different Definitions Clarify
      Matters?</h2><p>Since the claim that \u201Cmost chemistry is engineering\u201D
      is weird, we might consider alternative definitions to solve this problem.</p><p>One
      appealing definition: \u201Ca scientist is anyone who uses the scientific method.\u201D
      As I discussed above, in the case of the automotive engineer, lots of people
      use the scientific method who clearly aren\u2019t scientists: engineers, yes,
      but also detectives, doctors, and many other people. Indeed, according to this
      definition almost anyone who acquires data to shed light on a problem is \u201Cdoing
      science.\u201D So I don\u2019t think this is a very good definition.</p><p>Another
      definition might be: \u201Cif you\u2019re closely involved with science, you\u2019re
      a scientist, even if the work you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t literally pushing
      the frontiers of knowledge forward.\u201D I\u2019m sympathetic to this definition,
      but I still find it hard to separate scientists and engineers here. What makes
      an engineer optimizing a new flow reactor less of a scientist than the chemist
      optimizing a new catalyst? Are they both scientists? What about people who work
      on chip design and fabrication, or people who design analytical instruments,
      or people who use them? I can\u2019t find any clean way to divide scientists
      from engineers that recapitulates the conventional usage of the terms.</p><h2>Why
      Does This Matter?</h2><p>I think the root of this confusion is that the nature
      of scientific fields has changed over the past half-century. Organic chemistry
      hasn\u2019t always been largely engineering; a century ago, the structure of
      natural products and the nature of the chemical bond were mysteries, truly the
      domain of science, and these issues were studied by chemists. As we\u2019ve
      grown to understand our field better and better, our work has shifted from science
      to engineering\u2014the true mysteries in chemistry are now few and far between,
      and the challenge facing today\u2019s chemists is how to use centuries of accumulated
      knowledge to better society. But because of our lineage, we think of ourselves
      as scientists, and have managed to disguise the true nature of our work so well
      that we\u2019ve deceived even ourselves.</p><p>By this point, it should be obvious
      that I don\u2019t think science is superior to engineering. In fact, I\u2019m
      glad to work in an area that\u2019s largely engineering! But the way that an
      engineer ought to approach their work is different from the way a scientist
      ought to approach their work. In writing this piece, I came across a 1996 <a
      href=\\\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/227234.227243\\\">article</a> by Frederick
      Brooks, who argued that computer science was better understood as an engineering
      discipline and defended the importance of this claim:</p><blockquote><p>If our
      discipline has been misnamed, so what? Surely computer science is a harmless
      conceit. What\u2019s in a name? Much. Our self-misnaming hastens various unhappy
      trends. <br><br>First, it implies that we accept a perceived pecking order that
      respects natural scientists highly and engineers less so, and that we seek to
      appropriate the higher station for ourselves. That is a self-serving gambit,
      hence dubious\u2026. <br><br>Second, sciences legitimately take the discovery
      of facts and laws as a proper end in itself. A new fact, a new law is an accomplishment,
      worthy of publication\u2026. But in design, in contrast with science, novelty
      in itself has no merit. If we recognize our artifacts as tools, we test them
      by their usefulness and their costs, not their novelty. <br><br>Third, we tend
      to forget our users and their real problems, climbing into our ivory towers
      to dissect tractable abstractions of those problems, abstractions that may have
      left behind the essence of the real problem.</p></blockquote><p>I think Brooks\u2019s
      summary is simple and elegant. If we judge the value of our work based on the
      utility of our tools, rather than the novelty of our ideas, we\u2019ll spend

      of integral screening; this was the best I got.</figcaption></figure></div><p>One
      big advance in electronic structure calculations was the development of integral
      screening techniques, the most popular of which is the \u201CSchwartz inequality\u201D
      (derived from the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality\\\">Cauchy\u2013Schwartz
      inequality</a>, but actually developed by <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540100111\\\">Mario
      H\xE4ser and Reinhart Ahlrichs</a> [<strong>EDIT: This is wrong, see correction
      at end!</strong>]). If we denote an ERI over shells A, B, C, and D as (AB|CD),
      then the Schwartz inequality says:</p><p>(AB|CD) \u2264 (AB|AB)<sup>0.5</sup>
      (CD|CD)<sup>0.5</sup></p><p>This is pretty intuitive: each shell pair will interact
      with itself most, since it has perfect overlap with itself, and so the geometric
      mean of the interaction of each shell pair with itself is an upper bound for
      the interaction between the two shell pairs. (Why would (AB|AB) ever be a small
      value? Well, A and B might be super far away from each other, and so the \u201Cshell
      pair\u201D has very little overlap is just negligible.)</p><p>This result is
      very useful. Since there are many fewer integrals of the form (AB|AB), we can
      start by calculating all of those, and then use the resulting values to \u201Cscreen\u201D
      each shell quartet. If the predicted value is less than some predefined cutoff,
      the integral is skipped. While these screening methods don\u2019t help much
      with small molecules, where all of the shells are pretty close to each other,
      they become crucial for medium-sized molecules and above.</p><p>(What\u2019s
      the cutoff value? Orca defaults to 10<sup>-8</sup>, <a href=\\\"https://gaussian.com/integral/\\\">Gaussian</a>
      to 10<sup>-12</sup>, <a href=\\\"https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/autodir_options_c/module__scf.html\\\">Psi4</a>
      to 10<sup>-12</sup>, and <a href=\\\"https://manual.q-chem.com/5.2/Ch4.S3.SS2.html\\\">QChem</a>
      to 10<sup>-8</sup>\u201310<sup>-10</sup> depending on the type of calculation.)</p><p>The
      Schwartz inequality neglects, however, another way in which (AB|CD) might be
      very small: if (AB| and |CD) aren\u2019t independently negligible, but are just
      really far away from each other. One elegant way to address this (out of many)
      comes from recent-ish work by <a href=\\\"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994190\\\">Travis
      Thompson and Christian Ochsenfeld</a>. They define an intermediate quantity
      M for each pair of shells, derived from different high-symmetry integrals:</p><p>M<sub>AC</sub>
      := (AA|CC) / ( (AA|AA)<sup>0.5</sup> (CC|CC)<sup>0.5</sup> )</p><p>M<sub>AC</sub>
      intuitively represents the distance between the two shells, and is guaranteed
      to be in the range [0,1]. Thompson and Ochsenfeld then use this quantity to
      propose an estimate of a shell quartet\u2019s value:</p><p>(AB|CD) \u2248 (AB|AB)<sup>0.5</sup>
      (CD|CD)<sup>0.5</sup> max(M<sub>AC</sub>M<sub>BD</sub>, M<sub>AD</sub>M<sub>BC</sub>)</p><p>This
      is no longer a rigorous upper bound like the Schwartz inequality, but it\u2019s
      a pretty good estimate of the size of the integral.</p><p> How much of a difference
      does this make in practice? To test this, I ran HF/STO-3G calculations on dodecane
      in the fully linear configuration. As shown by <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314\\\">Alml\xF6f,
      Faegri, and Korsell</a>, linear molecules benefit the most from integral screening
      (since the shells are on average farther apart), so I hoped to see a sizable
      effect without having to study particularly large molecules.</p><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      few things are apparent for this data. First, even tight thresholds lead to
      dramatic speedups relative to the unscreened calculation\u2014and with minimal
      errors. Secondly, the CSAM bound really does work better than the QQ bound (especially
      if you ignore the high-error 10<sup>-9</sup> threshold data point). For most
      threshold values, using CSAM leads to about a 20% increase in speed, at the
      cost of a 3-fold increase in an already small error. Viewed visually, we can

      landmark 1982 paper</a>. To the untrained eye, this appears unrelated to ERI-based
      screening, but we are using Gaussian basis sets and so \u201Cone can therefore
      write the integrals in terms of overlaps,\u201D meaning that what looked like
      a different expression is actually the same thing. (Section 9.12 of Helgaker/Jorgensen/Olsen's

      Balaouras</a>).</figcaption></figure></div><p>Meta-optimization has long been
      a focus of research in computer science, where new optimization algorithms can
      have an incredibly high impact (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf\\\">ADAM</a>,
      one of the most commonly used optimizers for neural network training). More
      recently, the advent of directed evolution has made optimization methods a central
      focus of biocatalysis, since (in many cases) the efficacy of the reaction one
      discovers is primarily dependent on the efficacy of the optimization method
      used.</p><p>In contrast, it seems that meta-optimization has historically attracted
      less attention from \u201Cclassic\u201D organic chemists, despite the central
      importance of reaction optimization to so much of what we do. This post aims
      to show some of the ways in which this paradigm is changing, and briefly summarize
      some of what I consider to be the most interesting and exciting recent advances
      in chemical meta-optimization. <em>(This is a big and somewhat nebulous area,
      and I am certainly leaving things out or not paying due homage to everyone.
      Sorry in advance!)</em></p><h3>Design of Experiments, and Dealing with Discrete
      Variables</h3><p>Perhaps the best-known optimization algorithm in chemistry
      is \u201Cdesign of experiments\u201D (DoE), which uses statistical methods to
      estimate the shape of a multiparameter surface and find minima or maxima more
      efficiently than one-factor-at-a-time screening. (DoE is a pretty broad term
      that gets used to describe a lot of different techniques: for more reading,
      <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_surface_methodology\\\">see</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_composite_design\\\">these</a>
      <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Behnken_design\\\">links</a>.)</p><p>DoE
      has been used for a long time, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/op500169m\\\">especially
      in process chemistry</a>, and is very effective at optimizing continuous variables
      (like temperature, concentration, and equivalents). However, it\u2019s less
      obvious how DoE might be extended to discrete variables. (<a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ol1020898\\\">This
      2010 report</a>, from scientists at Eli Lilly, reports the use of DoE to optimize
      a palladium-catalyzed pyrazole arylation, but without many details about the
      statistical methods used.)</p><p><a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/op300275p\\\">A
      nice paper</a> from Jonathan Moseley and co-workers illustrates why discrete
      variables are so tricky:</p><blockquote><p>How does one compare such different
      solvents as hexane and DMSO for example? Comparing their relative polarities,
      which is often related to solubility, might be one way, but this may not be
      the most important factor for the reaction in question. Additionally, this simple
      trend may not be relevant in any case, given for example that chlorinated solvents
      have good solubilising power despite their low-to-medium polarity (as judged
      by their dielectric constant). On the other hand, the high polarity and solubilising
      power of alcohols might be compromised in the desired reaction by their protic
      nature, whilst the \u201Cunrelated\u201D hexane and DMSO are both aprotic. <br><br>In
      summary, replacing any one of the discrete parameters with another does not
      yield a different value on the same axis of a graph, as it would for a continuous
      parameter; instead it requires a different graph with different axes which may
      have no meaningful relationship to the first one whatsoever. This means that
      every single combination of catalyst/ligand/base/solvent is essentially a different
      reaction for the same two starting materials to produce the same product. <em>(emphasis
      added)</em></p></blockquote><p>The solution the authors propose is to use principal
      component analysis (PCA) on molecular descriptors, such as \u201Cmeasurable
      physical factors (e.g., bp, density, bond length), or calculated and theoretical
      ones (e.g., electron density, Hansen solubility parameters, Kamlet\u2013Taft
      solvent polarity parameters),\u201D to convert discrete parameters into continuous
      ones. This general approach for handling discrete variables\u2014generation
      of continuous molecular descriptors, followed by use of a dimensionality reduction
      algorithm\u2014is widely used today for lots of tasks (see for instance <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ob/c5ob01892g\\\">this
      paper</a> on DoE for solvent screening, and <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220926_plotting_diversity.html\\\">my
      previous post on UMAP</a>).</p><h3>Choosing Intelligent Screening Sets</h3><p>With
      continuous descriptors for formally discrete variables in hand, a natural next
      step is to use this data to choose catalyst/substrates that best cover chemical
      space. (This can be done with several algorithms; see <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm9700878?ref=PDF\\\">this
      paper</a> for more discussion) In 2016, this technique was popularized by the
      Merck <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/sc/c5sc04751j\\\">\u201Cinformer
      library\u201D</a> approach, which generated sets of aryl boronic esters and
      aryl halides that could be used to fairly evaluate new reactions against complex,
      drug-like substrates. (See also <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00760\\\">this

      intended to be shared and used by lots of research groups, recently it\u2019s
      become more common for individual research groups to design their own project-specific
      screening sets. Abbie Doyle and co-workers <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203\\\">kicked
      this off</a> in 2022 by using DFT-based descriptors, UMAP dimensionality reduction,
      and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to generate a maximally diverse set
      of commercial aryl bromides. Other groups soon followed suit: <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01813\\\">Karl
      Gademann</a> used this approach to study bromotetrazine cross coupling, while
      Marion Emmert and co-workers at Merck <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c10557\\\">employed
      similar methods</a> to investigate azole carboxylation. (I\u2019ve also used
      this approach for substrate selection!)</p><p>This approach can also be used
      to design intelligent sets of catalysts/ligands at the outset of a screening
      project. Using <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c09718\\\">their
      \u201Ckraken\u201D dataset of phosphine properties</a>, Tobias Gensch and Matt

      a set of 32 commercially available ligands</a> which aims to cover as much of
      phosphine chemical space as possible in an initial screen. Jason Stevens and
      co-workers combined this idea with the substrate-selection methods from the
      previous paragraph to <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.2c00089\\\">perform
      a detailed study</a> of Ni-catalyzed borylation under many conditions, and tested
      a variety of ML models on the resulting dataset. (Scott Denmark and co-workers

      ML-driven reaction optimization</a>.)</p><h3>New Optimization Algorithms</h3><p>As
      in every area of life, ML-based approaches have been used a lot for optimization
      recently. This isn\u2019t new; Klaus Jensen and Steve Buchwald <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/RE/C6RE00153J\\\">used
      machine learning</a> to drive autonomous optimization in 2016, and <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492\\\">Richard
      Zare</a> published a detailed methodological study in 2017. Nevertheless, as
      with computational substrate selection, these techniques have come into the
      mainstream in the past few years.</p><p>I mentioned the work of Scott Denmark
      on ML-driven optimization before, and his team published two more papers on
      this topic last year: <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08820\\\">one
      on atropselective biaryl iodination</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155\\\">one
      on optimization of </a><em><a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155\\\">Cinchona</a></em><a
      href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155\\\"> alkaloid-based
      phase transfer catalysts</a>. In particular, the second paper (conducted in
      collaboration with scientists at Merck) illustrates how an ML model can be updated
      with new data as optimization progresses, allowing many sequential rounds of
      catalyst development to be conducted.</p><p>Abbie Doyle\u2019s group has done
      a lot of work on using <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization\\\">Bayesian
      optimization</a> (BO) to drive reaction optimization. <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03213-y\\\">Their
      first paper</a> in this area illustrated the capacity of BO to avoid spurious
      local minima, and went on to validate this approach in a variety of complex
      problems. Even better, they compared the results of BO to chemist-guided optimization
      to see if computer-driven optimization could outcompete expert intuition. To
      quote the paper:</p><blockquote><p>In total, 50 expert chemists and engineers
      from academia and industry played the reaction optimization game (Fig. 4c).
      Accordingly, the Bayesian reaction optimizer also played the game 50 times (Fig.
      4b), each time starting with a different random initialization. The first point
      of comparison between human participants and the machine learning optimizer
      was their raw maximum observed yield at each step during the optimization. Humans
      made significantly (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) better initial choices than random
      selection, on average discovering conditions that had 15% higher yield in their
      first batch of experiments. However, even with random initialization, within
      three batches of five experiments the average performance of the optimizer surpassed
      that of the humans. Notably, in contrast to human participants, Bayesian optimization
      achieved &gt;99% yield 100% of the time within the experimental budget. Moreover,
      Bayesian optimization tended to discover globally optimal conditions (CgMe-PPh,
      CsOPiv or CsOAc, DMAc, 0.153 M, 105\u2009\xB0C) within the first 50 experiments
      (Fig. 4b). <em>(emphasis added)</em></p></blockquote><div class=\\\"captioned-image-container\\\"><figure><a

      subsequent work</a> has made their optimization app available online, and illustrated

      <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc8743\\\">this work</a>
      from Aspuru-Guzik, Burke, and co-workers, which uses a \u201Cmatrix-down\u201D
      approach to choosing representative substrates for the Suzuki reaction (similar
      to the substrate-selection algorithms discussed previously). The selected substrates
      are then subjected to automated high-throughput screening guided by an uncertainty-minimizing
      ML model (i.e., new reactions are chosen based on the regions of chemical space
      that the algorithm has the least knowledge about; this is similar to, but distinct
      from, Bayesian optimization). This is a pretty interesting approach, and I hope
      they study it further in the future. (Aspuru-Guzik has done <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03716\\\">lots
      of other work</a> in this area, including some <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307\\\">Bayesian
      optimization</a>.)</p><p>Finally, two papers this year (that I\u2019m aware
      of) put forward the idea of using multi-substrate loss functions for optimization:
      <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05263-2\\\">our work
      on screening for generality</a> and <a href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/636a84ab80c9bf01cc8d95f9\\\">a
      beautiful collaboration</a> from Song Lin, Scott Miller, and Matt Sigman. These
      papers used \u201Clow-tech\u201D optimization methods that are familiar to practicing
      organic chemists (e.g. \u201Cscreen different groups at this position\u201D),
      but evaluated the output of this optimization not based on the yield/enantioselectivity
      of a single substrate but on aggregate metrics derived from many substrates.
      The results that our groups were able to uncover were good, but I\u2019m sure
      adding robotics and advanced ML optimization will turbocharge this concept and
      find new and better catalysts with truly remarkable generality.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Reaction
      optimization is a common task in organic chemistry, but one that\u2019s commonly
      done without much metacognition. Instead, many researchers will screen catalysts,
      substrates, and conditions based on habit or convenience, without necessarily
      dwelling on whether their screening procedure is optimal. While this may work
      well enough when you only need to optimize one or two reactions in your whole
      graduate school career (or when acquiring each data point takes days or weeks),
      <em>ad hoc</em> strategies will at some point simply fail to scale.</p><p>Organic
      chemistry, long the realm of \u201Csmall data,\u201D is slowly but inexorably
      catching up with the adjacent sciences. As progress in lab automation and instrumentation
      makes setting up, purifying, and analyzing large numbers of reactions easier,
      experimental chemists will have to figure out how to choose which reactions
      to run and how to handle all the data from these reactions, using tools like
      the ones discussed above. Like it or not, data science and cheminformatics may
      soon become core competencies of the modern experimental chemist!</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"While

      structures that are substantially sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized at carbon, irrespective
      of whether sp<sup>2</sup> character is technically increasing or decreasing

      class=\\\"image-caption\\\">These both look pretty much like iminium ions.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We
      can also conceptualize this in terms of elementary steps. Taken by itself, alkene
      addition does lead to an inverse kinetic isotope effect, as seen by the decreasing
      values as one moves left from the iminium\u2014but an inverse isotope effect
      relative to the normal equilibrium isotope effect of the iminium. In this system,
      the equilibrium isotope effect of the iminium is larger than the kinetic isotope
      effect for alkene addition, and so the combination of these two effects leads
      to a (smaller) overall normal effect.</p><p>(This is the opposite of primary
      H/D KIEs, where central transition states lead to the largest isotope effects
      and equilibrium effects are typically small. Here, the isotope effect is mainly
      a function of hybridization, and so the later the TS, the greater the difference
      in hybridization and the larger the isotope effect.)</p><p>In summary, although
      this experiment seems informative, it\u2019s actually not very useful. It tells
      you something about the structure of the transition state, but not which step
      is rate-limiting! In this case, a better experiment would be to measure <sup>13</sup>C
      KIEs, or an H/D KIE on the nucleophile.</p><h3>Appendix I: What About S<sub>N</sub>2?</h3><p>On
      Twitter, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/LevinChem/status/1610287881993728000\\\">Mark
      Levin</a> asks about the KIE for the concerted path. I originally meant to include
      a discussion of this, but then totally forgot to! So let\u2019s fix that.</p><p>As
      shown in the graph above, extremely concerted pathways (i.e. going right down
      the middle of the MOJ plot) will have pretty small isotope effects. These sorts
      of mechanisms are common where the carbocation would be extremely unstable (methyl
      iodide) but much less common for stabilized carbocations like we\u2019re discussing
      here. When oxocarbeniums or iminiums are involved, even \u201Cconcerted\u201D
      mechanisms shift towards the bottom right corner: this is the <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja506092h\\\">\u201Cloose\u201D/\u201Cexploded\u201D
      S<sub>N</sub>2</a> often seen in glycosylation. These pathways will have a modest
      to large H/D KIE, depending on the exact system and how \u201Cexploded\u201D
      they are (see page 53 of <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621\\\">this
      SI</a> for examples)</p><p>Putting this together, then, what experimental results
      would be conclusive? A very small KIE would be diagnostic for a \u201Cclassic\u201D
      synchronous S<sub>N</sub>2 process, which I consider to be very unlikely here.
      But medium or large H/D KIEs are consistent with any possibility: S<sub>N</sub>1
      with rate-limiting ionization, S<sub>N</sub>1 with rate-limiting nucleophilic
      attack, or a loose S<sub>N</sub>2. There\u2019s an annulus of different mechanistic
      possibilities that all give about the same isotope effect, as shown below:</p><div

      structures, a molecular property, such as energy, nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectra, or optical rotation values may not be sufficiently described by a single
      structure. At finite temperatures, various conformers are populated and the
      overall property must be described as thermal average over the unique property
      values of each conformer.</p></blockquote><p>What's been bothering me about
      this, however, is that Boltzmann weights are calculated as <em>e</em> to the
      power of the relative energy:</p><pre><code>def boltzmann_weight(conformer_properties,
      conformer_energies, temp=298):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Some simple Python code to

      - np.min(conformer_energies)\\n\\n    R = 3.1668105e-6 # eH/K\\n    weights
      = np.exp(-1*energies/(627.509*R*temp))\\n    weights = weights / np.sum(weights)\\n\\n
      \   return weights, np.average(conformer_properties, weights=weights)\\n</code></pre><p>Since
      relative energies of conformers are usually calculated with only middling accuracy
      (\xB10.2 kcal/mol with <a href=\\\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/cp/c0cp02984j\\\">common
      methods</a>), we\u2019re taking the exponential of a potentially inaccurate

      and co-authors address this point explicitly in their review:</p><blockquote><p>At
      the same time, however, conformational energies need to be accurate to within
      about 0.1\u20130.2\u2005kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup> to predict Boltzmann populations
      at room temperature reasonably well. This is particularly important since properties
      can vary strongly and even qualitatively between populated conformers\u2026</p></blockquote><p>Although
      the best answer is, of course, to just get more accurate energies, it's not
      always practical to do that in the real world. If we take imperfect energies
      as our starting point, what's the best strategy to pursue?</p><p>One could imagine
      a scenario in which error causes relatively unimportant conformers to end up
      with large weights, making the answer even worse than the na\xEFve approach
      would have been. If the lowest energy conformer accounts for 60-70% of the answer,
      might it be best to just stick with that, instead of trying to throw in some
      messy corrections?</p><p>To test this, I drew a random flexible-looking molecule
      with a few functional groups, conducted a conformational search using <em>crest</em>,
      and then optimized it and calculated <sup>19</sup>F NMR shieldings using wB97X-D/6-31G(d).
      (There are <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00624\\\">better
      NMR methods</a> out there, but the absolute accuracy of the shift isn\u2019t

      conformers are shown in green.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Conformational
      searching approaches attempt to prevent this sort of error by automating the
      process of finding conformers. There are lots of different algorithms one can
      use, like <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja952478m\\\">low-mode
      searching</a>, metadynamics, and replica exchange (to name just a few), and
      decades of literature on this topic.</p><p>Since conformational searching requires
      many individual calculations, it\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-0282-9_14\\\">almost
      never practical</a> to do a conformational search at a high level of theory
      (e.g. using DFT or <em>ab initio</em> methods). Instead, <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.2c00066\\\">forcefields</a>
      or <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00671\\\">semiempirical</a>
      methods are generally used, with the caveat that the conformers generated might
      have somewhat inaccurate geometries.</p><p><em>cctk</em> uses <a href=\\\"https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/\\\">crest</a>
      (from Grimme and coworkers), which uses a <a href=\\\"https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/page/overview/workflows.html#imtd-gc-algorithm\\\">metadynamics-based
      algorithm</a> with the <em>GFN2-xtb</em> semiempirical method to generate and
      score conformers. Although <em>crest</em> isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s simple,
      easy to use, and often generates very reasonable results.</p><p>I personally
      find the <em>crest</em> syntax a little tough to remember, so I\u2019ve created
      a Python script so that I don\u2019t have to look it up every time.</p><h3>Installing
      Packages</h3><p>To run this tutorial, you\u2019ll need to have <em>cctk</em>
      and <em>crest</em> installed. It\u2019s often easiest to manage dependencies
      using a <em>conda</em> environment; if you don\u2019t already have one, you
      can create one for this project with this code:</p><pre><code>conda create --name=chem
      python=3.8\\npip install cctk\\npip install pyyaml\\nconda install -c conda-forge
      crest\\n</code></pre><p>And in the future, you can activate the environment
      like this:</p><pre><code>conda activate chem\\n</code></pre><h3>Running the
      Tutorial</h3><p>The files for this tutorial can be found <a href=\\\"https://github.com/corinwagen/utilities/tree/master/csearch\\\">here</a>.
      ex.yaml, which is the only file you should need to modify, contains all the
      information needed for the python script do_crest.py:</p><pre><code># list of
      atoms to constrain\\n# atom1, atom2, distance (or \\\"auto\\\" to keep distance
      from initial geometry)\\nconstraints:\\n    constraint1: 17 31 auto\\n    constraint2:
      30 31 auto\\n\\n# location of input geometry, either as Gaussian .gjf or .out
      file\\ninput_geom: pictet_spengler.gjf\\n\\n# directory in which crest will
      run (will be created)\\ndirectory: crest\\n\\n# name of logfile\\nlogfile: crest.log\\n\\n#
      whether or not this is a noncovalent complex (true or false).\\n# this simply
      gets passed to crest; some settings are changed.\\nnoncovalent: false\\n</code></pre><p>To
      generate conformers, simply run:</p><pre><code>python do_crest.py ex.yaml\\n</code></pre><p>This
      takes about 30 seconds to run on my laptop, and will generate about a hundred
      output conformers, which can (if desired) be further refined using DFT.</p><p>Hopefully
      this is useful! Please feel free to contact me with questions or bug reports.</p>\",\"longer_truncated_body_json\":null,\"longer_truncated_body_html\":null,\"truncated_body_text\":\"Today

      I don't disagree with this at all; I've also used <sup>13</sup>C NMR to solve
      problems that <sup>1</sup>H NMR and mass spectrometry alone couldn't solve!
      But just because it\u2019s crucial sometimes doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s crucial
      all the time. Does anyone really think that you need carbon NMR to tell if Boc
      protection of a primary amine worked?</p><p>Most of the reactions that people
      do\u2014especially people for whom synthetic chemistry is a means and not an
      end\u2014are <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409\\\">pretty
      straightforward</a>, such that I think it\u2019s fair to assume you could deduce
      the correct product with high confidence without <sup>13</sup>C NMR. (Again,
      if carbon spectra were so crucial, it wouldn\u2019t be the case that many people
      don\u2019t get them until the very end of the project.)</p><h2>Commenters Who

      heard this from plenty of people before, and it's true that sometimes it's not
      hard at all to get a nice carbon spectrum! But sometimes it <em>is</em> really

      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/1603471344468840448\\\">2</a>).
      This is a fair point, and one I don't have a good response to.</p><p>However,
      it's worth noting that this is already what we do for pretty much every other
      claim, including many complex structural problems: give the data, draw a conclusion,
      and ask reviewers to evaluate the logic. Arguments about where the burden of
      proof should lie are tedious and usually unproductive, but I think we should
      have a pretty high barrier to making specific methods <em>de jure</em> required

      not trying to suggest that journals ought not to care about accuracy at all;
      <em>ceteris paribus</em>, accuracy should be prioritized. But given that we\u2019re
      all constrained by finite resources, it\u2019s important to consider the tradeoffs
      we\u2019re making with every policy decision. It\u2019s possible that trying
      to increase accuracy by asking for more data could have deleterious consequences:</p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s
      clear extremes on both ends: requiring <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra for publication
      is probably good, but requiring a crystal structure of every compound would
      be ridiculous.</p></blockquote><p>I think it\u2019s easiest to think about these
      issues in terms of two separate questions: (1) relative to where we are today,
      should we push for more accuracy in the literature or less, and (2) are we achieving
      our chosen degree of accuracy in the most efficient manner possible?</p><p>The
      first question is clearly complex, and probably deserves a longer and fuller
      treatment that I can provide here\u2014although I\u2019ll note that <a href=\\\"https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review\\\">others

      Bogdos</a> for the second link). I hope to write more on this subject later.</p><p>But
      the second question seems more straightforward. Is requiring <sup>13</sup>C

      a scientific tool; it\u2019s an excellent technique, and gives structural information
      that no other methods can. Rather, I take issue with the requirement that the
      identity of every published compound be verified with a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum.</p><p>Very
      few <sup>13</sup>C NMR experiments yield unanticipated results. While in some
      cases <sup>13</sup>C NMR is the only reliable way to characterize a molecule,
      in most cases the structural assignment is obvious from <sup>1</sup>H NMR, and
      any ambiguity can be resolved with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Most structure
      determination is boring. Elucidating the structure of bizarre secondary metabolites
      from sea sponges takes <sup>13</sup>C NMR; figuring out if your amide coupling
      or click reaction worked does not.</p><p>The irrelevance of <sup>13</sup>C NMR
      can be shown via the doctrine of revealed preference: most carbon spectra are
      acquired only for publication, indicating that researchers are confident in
      their structural assignments without <sup>13</sup>C NMR. It\u2019s not uncommon
      for the entire project to be scientifically \u201Cdone\u201D before any <sup>13</sup>C
      NMR spectra are acquired. In most fields, people treat <sup>13</sup>C NMR like
      a nuisance, not a scientific tool\u2014the areas where this isn\u2019t true,
      like total synthesis or sugar chemistry, are the areas where <sup>13</sup>C
      NMR is actually useful.</p><p>Requiring <sup>13</sup>C NMR for publication isn\u2019t
      costless. The low natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C and poor gyromagnetic
      ratio means that <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra are orders of magnitude more difficult
      to obtain than <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra. As a result, a large fraction of instrument
      time in any chemistry department is usually dedicated to churning out <sup>13</sup>C
      NMR spectra for publication, while people with actual scientific problems are
      kept waiting. <sup>13</sup>C NMR-induced demand for NMR time means departments
      have to buy more instruments, hire more staff, and use more resources; the costs
      trickle down.</p><p>And it\u2019s not like eliminating the requirement to provide
      <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra would totally upend the way we do chemical research.
      Most of our field\u2019s history, including some of our greatest achievements,
      were done in the age before carbon NMR\u2014the first <sup>13</sup>C NMR study
      of organic molecules was done by <a href=\\\"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1743253\\\">Lauterbur</a>
      in 1957, and it would take even longer for the techniques to advance to the
      point where non-specialists could use the technique routinely. Even in the early
      2000s you can find <em>JACS</em> papers without <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra in
      the SI, indicating that it's possible to do high-quality research without it.</p><p>Why,
      then, do we require <sup>13</sup>C NMR today? I think it stems from a misguided
      belief that scientific journals should be the ultimate arbiters of truth\u2014that
      what\u2019s reported in a journal ought to be trustworthy and above reproach.
      We hope that by requiring enough data, we can force scientists to do their science
      properly, and ferret out bad actors along the way. (Perhaps the clearest example
      of this mindset is <em>JOC</em> &amp; <em>Org. Lett.</em>, who maintain an ever-growing
      <a href=\\\"https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=joceah#data_requirements\\\">list
      of standards</a> for chemical data aimed at requiring all work to be high quality.)
      Our impulse to require more and more data flows from our desire to make science
      an institution, a vast repository of knowledge equipped to combat the legions
      of misinformation.</p><p>But this hasn\u2019t always been the role of science.
      Geoff Anders, <a href=\\\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/\\\">writing
      for </a><em><a href=\\\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/\\\">Palladium</a></em>,
      describes how modern science began as an explicitly anti-authoritative enterprise:</p><blockquote><p>Boyle
      maintained that it was possible to base all knowledge of nature on personal
      observation, thereby eliminating a reliance on the authority of others. He further
      proposed that if there were differences of opinion, they could be resolved by
      experiments which would yield observations confirming or denying those opinions.
      The idea that one would rely on one\u2019s own observations rather than those
      of others was enshrined in the motto of the Royal Society\u2014<em>nullius in
      verba</em>.</p></blockquote><p><em>nullius in verba</em> translates to \u201Ctake
      no one\u2019s word for it,\u201D not exactly a ringing endorsement of science
      as institutional authority. This same theme can be found in more recent history.
      Melinda Baldwin\u2019s <em><a href=\\\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature\\\">Making
      Nature</a></em> recounts how peer review\u2014a now-core part of scientific
      publishing\u2014became commonplace at <em>Nature</em> only in the 1970s. In

      didn't take <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The point
      I\u2019m trying to make is not that peer review is bad, or that scientific authority
      is bad, but that the goal of enforcing accuracy in the scientific literature
      is a new one, and perhaps harder to achieve than we think. There are problems
      in the scientific literature everywhere, big and small. John Ioannidis memorably
      claimed that <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\\\">\u201Cmost
      published findings are false,\u201D</a> and while chemistry may not suffer from
      the same issues as the social sciences, we have our own problems. <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00325\\\">Elemental
      analysis doesn\u2019t work</a>, <a href=\\\"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74474ee301c02d6c7916e\\\">integration
      grids cause problems</a>, and even <a href=\\\"http://blog-syn.blogspot.com/2013/02/blog-syn-003-benzylic-oxidation-of_18.html\\\">reactions
      from famous labs can\u2019t be replicated</a>. Based on this, we might conclude
      that we\u2019re very, very far from making science a robust repository of truth.</p><p>Nevertheless,
      progress marches on. A few misassigned compounds here and there don\u2019t cause
      too many problems, any more than a faulty elemental analysis report or a sketchy
      DFT study. Scientific research itself has mechanisms for error correction: anyone
      who\u2019s ever tried to reproduce a reaction has engaged in one such mechanism.
      Robust reactions get used, cited, and amplified, while reactions that never
      work slowly fade into obscurity. Indeed, despite all of the above failures,
      we\u2019re living through a golden age for our field.</p><p>Given that we will
      never be able to eradicate bad data completely, the normative question then
      becomes \u201Chow hard should we try?\u201D In an age of <a href=\\\"https://www.agrarheute.com/sites/agrarheute.com/files/2020-01/innovation_scientific_progress.pdf\\\">declining
      research productivity</a>, we should be mindful not only of the dangers of low
      standards (proliferation of bad work) but also of the dangers of high standards
      (making projects take way longer). There\u2019s clear extremes on both ends:
      requiring <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra for publication is probably good, but requiring
      a crystal structure of every compound would be ridiculous. The claim I hope
      to make here is that requiring <sup>13</sup>C NMR for every compound does more
      to slow down good work than it does to prevent bad work, and thus should be
      abandoned.</p><p><em> Update 12/16/2022: see <a href=\\\"https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221216_carbon_nmr_response.html\\\">some

      which [attracted some controversy on\nX](https://twitter.com/FindlaterGroup/status/1742734408782876949).
      Here\nare some responses:\n\n- \"POC has evolved in many directions and its

      drug discovery.\" -\n  [Bill\n  Jorgensen](https://twitter.com/JorgensenWL/status/1742963638351089825)\n\n-

      \"It makes no sense. Looking at orbitals, measuring KIE, studying\n  mechanisms,

      on steroids.\" - [Sebastian\n  Kozuch](https://twitter.com/KozuchSebastian/status/1742795358680293550)\n\n-
      \"Hard core classical phys-org maybe, but structure-activity\n  relationships
      are alive and well across all chemistry disciplines.\n  These have their origin
      in phys-org and use so many fundamental\n  principles I learned as a PhD student

      \"I\\''ve attend 10 Phys Org GRC meetings since 1999 & chaired 2015. I\\''m\n  OK
      with ''traditional phys. org. chemistry'' being barely practiced. It\n  was
      dying--2001 saw 79 attendees, then the area morphed into phys.\n  org. of organometallics,
      supramolecular, biomolecules. Fields evolve\n  or die.\" - [Michael\n  Haley](https://twitter.com/UOHaleyLab/status/1742748763670843722)\n\n(There
      are plenty more responses; if I didn''t list yours, sorry!)\n\nFor the most
      part, I agree with these responses. Physical organic\nthinking has permeated
      organic chemistry and adjacent fields: George\nWhitesides has probably [the
      best piece on this\ntopic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijch.201500061),
      in\nwhich he argues that the essence of physical organic chemistry is \"a\ngeneral,
      and remarkably versatile, method for tackling complex\nproblems,\" not anything
      about chemistry per se, and consequently that\nthe physical organic mindset
      can be applied to problems in all manner of\nfields. Viewed from this angle,
      we might say that physical organic\nchemistry hasn''t disappeared at all---instead,
      it''s become so\ncommonplace that we forget to acknowledge it as distinctive
      at all.\n\nLooking through the organic chemistry curriculum, too, suggests that\nphysical
      organic chemistry is here to stay. Lots of the ideas that we\nteach to undergraduates,
      like molecular orbital theory and\nstructure--activity relationships, were once
      distinctively the domain of\nphysical organic chemists. Textbooks from before
      the apotheosis of\nphysical organic chemistry (I have an old copy of Fieser
      & Fieser, for\ninstance) are structured in a completely different way, not by
      mechanism\nbut by functional group, while today many undergraduate organic classes\ndiscuss
      S~N~1/S~N~2 mechanisms in their first semester.\n\nSo, was I entirely wrong
      to claim that traditional physical organic\nchemistry is a dying art? I don''t
      think so. Despite all the successes of\nphysical organic chemistry, it seems
      to me that something has been lost\nbetween the time of the norbornyl cation
      controversy and today. The\nsorts of elegant kinetic experimentation and argumentation
      that Winstein\nand others employed in their papers are now rare: take, for instance,\n[this
      famous paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01583a022)\ndistinguishing
      between contact ion pairs and solvent-separated ion\npairs. How many scientists
      today still do experiments like this? There\nare certainly names that come to
      mind, but from where I sit it seems to\nbe an increasingly niche skillset.\n\n:::

      have been forgotten by chemistry\nbecause there are better ways of doing the

      are plenty more responses; if I didn't list yours, sorry!)\\n\\nFor the most
      part, I agree with these responses. Physical organic\\nthinking has permeated
      organic chemistry and adjacent fields: George\\nWhitesides has probably [the
      best piece on this\\ntopic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijch.201500061),
      in\\nwhich he argues that the essence of physical organic chemistry is \\\"a\\ngeneral,
      and remarkably versatile, method for tackling complex\\nproblems,\\\" not anything
      about chemistry per se, and consequently that\\nthe physical organic mindset
      can be applied to problems in all manner of\\nfields. Viewed from this angle,
      we might say that physical organic\\nchemistry hasn't disappeared at all---instead,
      it's become so\\ncommonplace that we forget to acknowledge it as distinctive
      at all.\\n\\nLooking through the organic chemistry curriculum, too, suggests
      that\\nphysical organic chemistry is here to stay. Lots of the ideas that we\\nteach
      to undergraduates, like molecular orbital theory and\\nstructure--activity relationships,
      were once distinctively the domain of\\nphysical organic chemists. Textbooks
      from before the apotheosis of\\nphysical organic chemistry (I have an old copy
      of Fieser & Fieser, for\\ninstance) are structured in a completely different
      way, not by mechanism\\nbut by functional group, while today many undergraduate
      organic classes\\ndiscuss S~N~1/S~N~2 mechanisms in their first semester.\\n\\nSo,
      was I entirely wrong to claim that traditional physical organic\\nchemistry
      is a dying art? I don't think so. Despite all the successes of\\nphysical organic
      chemistry, it seems to me that something has been lost\\nbetween the time of
      the norbornyl cation controversy and today. The\\nsorts of elegant kinetic experimentation
      and argumentation that Winstein\\nand others employed in their papers are now
      rare: take, for instance,\\n[this famous paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01583a022)\\ndistinguishing
      between contact ion pairs and solvent-separated ion\\npairs. How many scientists
      today still do experiments like this? There\\nare certainly names that come
      to mind, but from where I sit it seems to\\nbe an increasingly niche skillset.\\n\\n:::

      \\\"It makes no sense. Looking at orbitals, measuring KIE, studying\\n  mechanisms,

      \\\"Hard core classical phys-org maybe, but structure-activity\\n  relationships

      are plenty more responses; if I didn't list yours, sorry!)\\n\\nFor the most
      part, I agree with these responses. Physical organic\\nthinking has permeated
      organic chemistry and adjacent fields: George\\nWhitesides has probably [the
      best piece on this\\ntopic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijch.201500061),
      in\\nwhich he argues that the essence of physical organic chemistry is \\\"a\\ngeneral,
      and remarkably versatile, method for tackling complex\\nproblems,\\\" not anything
      about chemistry per se, and consequently that\\nthe physical organic mindset
      can be applied to problems in all manner of\\nfields. Viewed from this angle,
      we might say that physical organic\\nchemistry hasn't disappeared at all---instead,
      it's become so\\ncommonplace that we forget to acknowledge it as distinctive
      at all.\\n\\nLooking through the organic chemistry curriculum, too, suggests
      that\\nphysical organic chemistry is here to stay. Lots of the ideas that we\\nteach
      to undergraduates, like molecular orbital theory and\\nstructure--activity relationships,
      were once distinctively the domain of\\nphysical organic chemists. Textbooks
      from before the apotheosis of\\nphysical organic chemistry (I have an old copy
      of Fieser & Fieser, for\\ninstance) are structured in a completely different
      way, not by mechanism\\nbut by functional group, while today many undergraduate
      organic classes\\ndiscuss S~N~1/S~N~2 mechanisms in their first semester.\\n\\nSo,
      was I entirely wrong to claim that traditional physical organic\\nchemistry
      is a dying art? I don't think so. Despite all the successes of\\nphysical organic
      chemistry, it seems to me that something has been lost\\nbetween the time of
      the norbornyl cation controversy and today. The\\nsorts of elegant kinetic experimentation
      and argumentation that Winstein\\nand others employed in their papers are now
      rare: take, for instance,\\n[this famous paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01583a022)\\ndistinguishing
      between contact ion pairs and solvent-separated ion\\npairs. How many scientists
      today still do experiments like this? There\\nare certainly names that come
      to mind, but from where I sit it seems to\\nbe an increasingly niche skillset.\\n\\n:::

      don't want to fall into the trap of idolizing the past for no reason;\\nthere
      are plenty of techniques which have been forgotten by chemistry\\nbecause there
      are better ways of doing the same thing today. Chemists\\nused to estimate molecular
      weight by dissolving a known mass of sample\\nand measuring the boiling point
      elevation induced. Now we have mass\\nspectrometry, so nobody uses the boiling
      point method any more, and I\\ndon't see this as a great tragedy.\\n\\nBut kinetics,
      and more generally the sort of careful physical organic\\nchemistry practiced
      by participants in the norbornyl cation debate,\\ndoesn't seem to have such
      a simple replacement. Computation is the most\\nobvious candidate, but we're
      still a long way away from being able to\\npredict mechanisms accurately *in
      silico*; in mechanistic chemistry,\\n[experiments still reign\\nsupreme](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja5111392).
      Kinetic\\nisotope effects are much easier to measure than they were back in\\nWinstein's
      day, but they're hardly routine experiments (and easy to get\\nwrong). The rigor
      and precision with which old-school physical organic\\nchemistry approached
      mechanistic problems can still be found today, but\\nit seems harder and harder
      to find.\\n\\nIt might have been inevitable that physical organic chemistry
      was always\\ngoing to evolve away from incredibly detailed studies of simple\\nreactions
      on simple molecules---just as biology has largely shifted from\\necology and
      taxonomy to cell biology and biochemistry, organic chemistry\\ntoo must change
      in order to keep working on the most interesting\\nproblems. And perhaps there\\\\'s
      some truth to the argument that the\\nold-school style of painstaking mechanistic
      study just isn\\\\'t worth the\\neffort and deserves to be de-emphasized. But
      it does seem to me that\\nparts of the tradition of physical organic knowledge
      (to borrow [Samo\\nBurja's\\nphrasing](https://samoburja.com/on-the-loss-and-preservation-of-knowledge/))\\nis
      being slowly lost to time, despite the fact that lots of really good\\nphysical
      organic chemistry is still being done today on all sorts of\\nproblems (enzymatic
      chemistry, organometallic chemistry, catalysis,\\nheterogenous catalysis, chemical
      biology, &c), and that makes me sad.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"140394296\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      the 1960s Winstein''s interpretation was challenged by another\npreeminent chemist,
      H.C. Brown, who argued that the data could\nadequately be explained by rapidly
      equilibrating classical carbocations.\nBrown suggested that most of the observations
      made by Winstein could be\nexplained simply by the differing steric profiles
      of the *exo* and\n*endo* faces of the norbornyl cation: the *endo* face is more
      shielded,\nand so ionization is slowed (explaining the 350:1 *exo*/*endo* rates)\nand
      attack is disfavored (explaining why both isomers of sulfonate give\n*exo* product).\n\nThis
      began an incredibly contentious series of debates which dragged on\nfor decades.
      Rather than attempt to wade through the resulting sea of\npublications, I''ll
      quote from [an excellent 1983\nreview](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar00096a004)
      by Cheves\nWalling to give a sense for the magnitude of the controversy:\n\n>
      The debate \\[over the structure of the norbornyl cation\\] was\n> vigorously
      pursued verbally in lectures, meetings, and seminars all\n> over the U.S. and
      even abroad.... No one has ever counted the number\n> of publications touching
      on the 2-norbornyl cation problem, but they\n> include a number of reviews,
      chapters, and books, and a typcial\n> *\\[sic\\]* research paper may well include
      references to over 100\n> others.\n\nWalling''s review goes on to give an excellent
      overview of the various\npieces of evidence employed by both sides of the debate,
      which I won''t\nsummarize in full here.\n\nThe most important data was obtained
      by George Olah and co-workers, who\npioneered the use of superacidic media to
      generate stable solutions of\ncarbocations which could be characterized spectroscopically.
      With Martin\nSaunders and others, Olah employed ^1^H and ^13^C NMR spectroscopy,
      IR\nspectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and core electron spectroscopy to\nstudy
      low-temperature solutions of norbornyl cations: in all cases, the\ndata supported
      Winstein''s proposed symmetric structure. (While\nequilibration occurring faster
      than the spectroscopic timescale could\nnot be ruled out by Olah''s work, spectroscopic
      measurements all the way\ndown to 5 K showed no detectable classical structures,
      indicating that\nany barrier to interconversion must be \\<0.2 kcal/mol.)\n\n:::

      chemistry, which became able to tackle problems like this\nin the late 1980s

      cation. [A 1990\npaper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00186a073) used\nHF/6-31G(d)
      calculations in Gaussian 86 to show that the symmetric\nstructure was a minimum
      on the potential energy surface. Here''s a scan I\nran at the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d)
      level of theory, showing that the energy\nincreases as the \"classical\" C--C
      bond forms:\n\n*(can''t display inline, but [here''s a\nlink](https://labs.rowansci.com/public/scans/6e36bd88-1235-43e8-a505-91ac79d1bbf6))*\n\nSubsequent
      work has confirmed that Winstein was almost completely\ncorrect about the key
      issues. Most notably, [a 2013 crystal\nstructure](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238849)
      from\nKarsten Meyer demonstrates that the norbornyl cation is indeed\nnonclassical
      in the ground state, leading *Chemistry World* to [declare\nthe mystery\nsolved](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/crystal-structure-closes-classic-carbocation-case/6352.article).\nNevertheless,
      there''s still a little room for a classical cation\nsupporter to doubt this
      result: crystal structures are snapshots of\nsolid-state atomic configurations,
      while reactions occur in solution,\nwhere molecules are free to move around
      more. (In the *Chemistry World*\narticle, Paul Schleyer predicts that Brown
      himself would have raised\nthis objection.)\n\nA paper from Ken Houk and co-workers,
      [published a few days ago\nin](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.3c02325)\n*[JOC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.3c02325)*,
      addresses\nthis issue by directly modeling the solvolysis process through *ab\ninitio*
      molecular dynamics with explicit acetic acid solvent. In the\nsolvolysis of
      the exo sulfonate, the authors find the nonclassical\ncation is formed on average
      within 9 femtoseconds of C--O bond cleavage,\nwhich is about as quickly as is
      physically possible. Once formed, the\ncation is entirely nonclassical: \"classical
      2-norbornyl cations are a\nnegligible component of norbornyl cations in solution,\\\"
      thus addressing\nthe last objection of classical cation partisans.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84619971-3946-478b-a14a-d0e296b51b0d_1917x1453.jpeg\"\nclass=\"image-link

      the object-level fact that carbocations can exhibit nonclassical\n\u03c3-delocalization?\n\n###
      **1. Reality is confusing, and convincing arguments are often wrong.** {#reality-is-confusing-and-convincing-arguments-are-often-wrong.}\n\nIt''s
      a good exercise to go back and read the early H.C. Brown papers in\nthis area,
      like [this\naccount](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar50071a003). Brown
      was an\nincredible scientist (the 1979 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and his\ndata
      and reasoning are quite good; I find myself sympathizing with his\nviewpoint
      while reading his papers. Nevertheless, with the benefit of\nhindsight we know
      that he was wrong and Winstein was right. \"Humility\ncomes before honor.\"\n\n###
      **2. Tools drive scientific progress.** {#tools-drive-scientific-progress.}\n\nThe
      argument over the norbornyl cation was ultimately settled only by\nthe development
      of new techniques, like superacid chemistry, core\nelectron spectroscopy, and
      high-level calculations. Now that we have\nthese methods, it''s much easier
      to solve similar problems: if Winstein''s\npaper came out today, I doubt it
      would take more than a year or two to\nfigure everything out.\n\nThis aligns
      nicely with what [Freeman\nDyson](https://estudosdects.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dyson-science-ideas-or-tools.pdf)\ncalls
      a \"Galisonian\" view of scientific progress, where scientific\nprogress is
      driven not by ideas (the \"Kuhnian\" view) but by new tools\nand new data. In
      chemistry, at least, the tools-first view seems true to\nme---since 1950, it''s
      difficult to think of a development more important\nto organic chemistry than
      NMR spectroscopy, with flash column\nchromatography probably taking second place.\n\n###
      **3. It''s easy for fields to get distracted by controversy and lose relevance.**
      {#its-easy-for-fields-to-get-distracted-by-controversy-and-lose-relevance.}\n\nHere''s
      Walling again:\n\n> Since a significant fraction of the efforts of physical
      organic\n> chemists was drawn into the problem \\[of the norbornyl cation\\],
      an\n> unhappy consequence was a feeling on the part of many (including some\n>
      of those concerned with the distribution of research funds) that\n> physical
      organic chemistry was in danger of withdrawing into a world\n> of its own.\n\nAs
      older scientists have explained to me, the norbornyl cation debacle\nscared
      a generation of chemists away from physical organic chemistry.\nThe entire subfield
      became obsessed with a niche and somewhat irrelevant\nissue, while scientists
      in adjacent subfields looked on with bemusement\nand frustration. As a consequence,
      traditional physical organic\nchemistry is barely practiced today: few scientists
      have the skill or\nknowledge to conduct kinetic studies like those performed
      by Winstein,\nBrown, and others, and those still working in the area struggle
      to get\nfunding or recognition (in the words of Dan Singleton, [\"sucks when
      you\nhave to peddle your papers in\ncemeteries\"](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1275932027825664000)).\n\n(In
      [a nice historical\nperspective](http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p123-131.pdf),\nStephen
      Weininger argues the norbornyl cation debate was \"a hook on\nwhich to hang
      a much larger agenda,\" fueled both by a UK/US divide and a\ndeeper dispute
      about whether valence bond representations or molecular\norbital representations
      of chemical structures were superior. If this is\ntrue, it was a self-defeating
      exercise by all involved.)\n\nScientists should be motivated by a search for
      truth, but also by the\ndesire to improve the world. Usually these two aims
      go together: basic\nresearch without obvious societal implications often leads
      to unexpected\nand important findings, which is why the government supports
      science in\nthe first place. But it''s possible to become so myopically focused
      on a\nsingle issue in the name of truth that one forgets about other goals,
      as\narguably happened in the norbornyl cation imbroglio.\n\nControversy attracts
      attention: we''re drawn to it, against our better\njudgment, like moths to a
      flame. We have to be careful not to get\ncaptured by disputes that are, in the
      long run, not worth the effort.\n\n*Thanks to Eric Jacobsen for many conversations
      about the history of\nphysical organic chemistry, Eugene Kwan for conversations
      about the\nprinciple of nonperfect synchronization, and to Ari Wagen for feedback\non
      this post and six months of excellent front-end development for\nRowan. Any

      the 1960s Winstein's interpretation was challenged by another\\npreeminent chemist,
      H.C. Brown, who argued that the data could\\nadequately be explained by rapidly
      equilibrating classical carbocations.\\nBrown suggested that most of the observations
      made by Winstein could be\\nexplained simply by the differing steric profiles
      of the *exo* and\\n*endo* faces of the norbornyl cation: the *endo* face is
      more shielded,\\nand so ionization is slowed (explaining the 350:1 *exo*/*endo*
      rates)\\nand attack is disfavored (explaining why both isomers of sulfonate
      give\\n*exo* product).\\n\\nThis began an incredibly contentious series of debates
      which dragged on\\nfor decades. Rather than attempt to wade through the resulting
      sea of\\npublications, I'll quote from [an excellent 1983\\nreview](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar00096a004)
      by Cheves\\nWalling to give a sense for the magnitude of the controversy:\\n\\n>
      The debate \\\\[over the structure of the norbornyl cation\\\\] was\\n> vigorously
      pursued verbally in lectures, meetings, and seminars all\\n> over the U.S. and
      even abroad.... No one has ever counted the number\\n> of publications touching
      on the 2-norbornyl cation problem, but they\\n> include a number of reviews,
      chapters, and books, and a typcial\\n> *\\\\[sic\\\\]* research paper may well
      include references to over 100\\n> others.\\n\\nWalling's review goes on to
      give an excellent overview of the various\\npieces of evidence employed by both
      sides of the debate, which I won't\\nsummarize in full here.\\n\\nThe most important
      data was obtained by George Olah and co-workers, who\\npioneered the use of
      superacidic media to generate stable solutions of\\ncarbocations which could
      be characterized spectroscopically. With Martin\\nSaunders and others, Olah
      employed ^1^H and ^13^C NMR spectroscopy, IR\\nspectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
      and core electron spectroscopy to\\nstudy low-temperature solutions of norbornyl
      cations: in all cases, the\\ndata supported Winstein's proposed symmetric structure.
      (While\\nequilibration occurring faster than the spectroscopic timescale could\\nnot
      be ruled out by Olah's work, spectroscopic measurements all the way\\ndown to
      5 K showed no detectable classical structures, indicating that\\nany barrier
      to interconversion must be \\\\<0.2 kcal/mol.)\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55cdcd4d-cb01-4e14-b731-1e6d1bcb2eaa_634x892.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      work has confirmed that Winstein was almost completely\\ncorrect about the key
      issues. Most notably, [a 2013 crystal\\nstructure](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238849)
      from\\nKarsten Meyer demonstrates that the norbornyl cation is indeed\\nnonclassical

      there's still a little room for a classical cation\\nsupporter to doubt this
      result: crystal structures are snapshots of\\nsolid-state atomic configurations,
      while reactions occur in solution,\\nwhere molecules are free to move around
      more. (In the *Chemistry World*\\narticle, Paul Schleyer predicts that Brown
      himself would have raised\\nthis objection.)\\n\\nA paper from Ken Houk and

      addresses\\nthis issue by directly modeling the solvolysis process through *ab\\ninitio*
      molecular dynamics with explicit acetic acid solvent. In the\\nsolvolysis of
      the exo sulfonate, the authors find the nonclassical\\ncation is formed on average
      within 9 femtoseconds of C--O bond cleavage,\\nwhich is about as quickly as
      is physically possible. Once formed, the\\ncation is entirely nonclassical:
      \\\"classical 2-norbornyl cations are a\\nnegligible component of norbornyl

      can modern scientists learn from the norbornyl cation controversy,\\nbesides
      the object-level fact that carbocations can exhibit nonclassical\\n\u03C3-delocalization?\\n\\n###
      **1. Reality is confusing, and convincing arguments are often wrong.** {#reality-is-confusing-and-convincing-arguments-are-often-wrong.}\\n\\nIt's
      a good exercise to go back and read the early H.C. Brown papers in\\nthis area,
      like [this\\naccount](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar50071a003). Brown
      was an\\nincredible scientist (the 1979 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and his\\ndata
      and reasoning are quite good; I find myself sympathizing with his\\nviewpoint
      while reading his papers. Nevertheless, with the benefit of\\nhindsight we know
      that he was wrong and Winstein was right. \\\"Humility\\ncomes before honor.\\\"\\n\\n###
      **2. Tools drive scientific progress.** {#tools-drive-scientific-progress.}\\n\\nThe
      argument over the norbornyl cation was ultimately settled only by\\nthe development
      of new techniques, like superacid chemistry, core\\nelectron spectroscopy, and
      high-level calculations. Now that we have\\nthese methods, it's much easier
      to solve similar problems: if Winstein's\\npaper came out today, I doubt it
      would take more than a year or two to\\nfigure everything out.\\n\\nThis aligns
      nicely with what [Freeman\\nDyson](https://estudosdects.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dyson-science-ideas-or-tools.pdf)\\ncalls
      a \\\"Galisonian\\\" view of scientific progress, where scientific\\nprogress
      is driven not by ideas (the \\\"Kuhnian\\\" view) but by new tools\\nand new
      data. In chemistry, at least, the tools-first view seems true to\\nme---since
      1950, it's difficult to think of a development more important\\nto organic chemistry
      than NMR spectroscopy, with flash column\\nchromatography probably taking second
      place.\\n\\n### **3. It's easy for fields to get distracted by controversy and
      lose relevance.** {#its-easy-for-fields-to-get-distracted-by-controversy-and-lose-relevance.}\\n\\nHere's
      Walling again:\\n\\n> Since a significant fraction of the efforts of physical
      organic\\n> chemists was drawn into the problem \\\\[of the norbornyl cation\\\\],
      an\\n> unhappy consequence was a feeling on the part of many (including some\\n>
      of those concerned with the distribution of research funds) that\\n> physical
      organic chemistry was in danger of withdrawing into a world\\n> of its own.\\n\\nAs
      older scientists have explained to me, the norbornyl cation debacle\\nscared
      a generation of chemists away from physical organic chemistry.\\nThe entire
      subfield became obsessed with a niche and somewhat irrelevant\\nissue, while
      scientists in adjacent subfields looked on with bemusement\\nand frustration.
      As a consequence, traditional physical organic\\nchemistry is barely practiced
      today: few scientists have the skill or\\nknowledge to conduct kinetic studies
      like those performed by Winstein,\\nBrown, and others, and those still working
      in the area struggle to get\\nfunding or recognition (in the words of Dan Singleton,
      [\\\"sucks when you\\nhave to peddle your papers in\\ncemeteries\\\"](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1275932027825664000)).\\n\\n(In
      [a nice historical\\nperspective](http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p123-131.pdf),\\nStephen
      Weininger argues the norbornyl cation debate was \\\"a hook on\\nwhich to hang
      a much larger agenda,\\\" fueled both by a UK/US divide and a\\ndeeper dispute
      about whether valence bond representations or molecular\\norbital representations
      of chemical structures were superior. If this is\\ntrue, it was a self-defeating
      exercise by all involved.)\\n\\nScientists should be motivated by a search for
      truth, but also by the\\ndesire to improve the world. Usually these two aims
      go together: basic\\nresearch without obvious societal implications often leads
      to unexpected\\nand important findings, which is why the government supports
      science in\\nthe first place. But it's possible to become so myopically focused
      on a\\nsingle issue in the name of truth that one forgets about other goals,
      as\\narguably happened in the norbornyl cation imbroglio.\\n\\nControversy attracts
      attention: we're drawn to it, against our better\\njudgment, like moths to a
      flame. We have to be careful not to get\\ncaptured by disputes that are, in
      the long run, not worth the effort.\\n\\n*Thanks to Eric Jacobsen for many conversations
      about the history of\\nphysical organic chemistry, Eugene Kwan for conversations
      about the\\nprinciple of nonperfect synchronization, and to Ari Wagen for feedback\\non
      this post and six months of excellent front-end development for\\nRowan. Any
      errors are mine alone.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"140331498\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      the 1960s Winstein's interpretation was challenged by another\\npreeminent chemist,
      H.C. Brown, who argued that the data could\\nadequately be explained by rapidly
      equilibrating classical carbocations.\\nBrown suggested that most of the observations
      made by Winstein could be\\nexplained simply by the differing steric profiles
      of the *exo* and\\n*endo* faces of the norbornyl cation: the *endo* face is
      more shielded,\\nand so ionization is slowed (explaining the 350:1 *exo*/*endo*
      rates)\\nand attack is disfavored (explaining why both isomers of sulfonate
      give\\n*exo* product).\\n\\nThis began an incredibly contentious series of debates
      which dragged on\\nfor decades. Rather than attempt to wade through the resulting
      sea of\\npublications, I'll quote from [an excellent 1983\\nreview](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar00096a004)
      by Cheves\\nWalling to give a sense for the magnitude of the controversy:\\n\\n>
      The debate \\\\[over the structure of the norbornyl cation\\\\] was\\n> vigorously
      pursued verbally in lectures, meetings, and seminars all\\n> over the U.S. and
      even abroad.... No one has ever counted the number\\n> of publications touching
      on the 2-norbornyl cation problem, but they\\n> include a number of reviews,
      chapters, and books, and a typcial\\n> *\\\\[sic\\\\]* research paper may well
      include references to over 100\\n> others.\\n\\nWalling's review goes on to
      give an excellent overview of the various\\npieces of evidence employed by both
      sides of the debate, which I won't\\nsummarize in full here.\\n\\nThe most important
      data was obtained by George Olah and co-workers, who\\npioneered the use of
      superacidic media to generate stable solutions of\\ncarbocations which could
      be characterized spectroscopically. With Martin\\nSaunders and others, Olah
      employed ^1^H and ^13^C NMR spectroscopy, IR\\nspectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
      and core electron spectroscopy to\\nstudy low-temperature solutions of norbornyl
      cations: in all cases, the\\ndata supported Winstein's proposed symmetric structure.
      (While\\nequilibration occurring faster than the spectroscopic timescale could\\nnot
      be ruled out by Olah's work, spectroscopic measurements all the way\\ndown to
      5 K showed no detectable classical structures, indicating that\\nany barrier
      to interconversion must be \\\\<0.2 kcal/mol.)\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55cdcd4d-cb01-4e14-b731-1e6d1bcb2eaa_634x892.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      result: crystal structures are snapshots of\\nsolid-state atomic configurations,
      while reactions occur in solution,\\nwhere molecules are free to move around
      more. (In the *Chemistry World*\\narticle, Paul Schleyer predicts that Brown
      himself would have raised\\nthis objection.)\\n\\nA paper from Ken Houk and
      co-workers, [published a few days ago\\nin](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.3c02325)\\n*[JOC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.3c02325)*,
      addresses\\nthis issue by directly modeling the solvolysis process through *ab\\ninitio*
      molecular dynamics with explicit acetic acid solvent. In the\\nsolvolysis of
      the exo sulfonate, the authors find the nonclassical\\ncation is formed on average
      within 9 femtoseconds of C--O bond cleavage,\\nwhich is about as quickly as
      is physically possible. Once formed, the\\ncation is entirely nonclassical:
      \\\"classical 2-norbornyl cations are a\\nnegligible component of norbornyl
      cations in solution,\\\\\\\" thus addressing\\nthe last objection of classical
      cation partisans.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84619971-3946-478b-a14a-d0e296b51b0d_1917x1453.jpeg\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      and so is higher in energy. This is a nice\\nexample of the principle of nonperfect
      synchronization, explained\\nconcisely in [this\\npresentation](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/PJS-Group-Meeting-no-layering.pdf).\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWhat
      can modern scientists learn from the norbornyl cation controversy,\\nbesides
      the object-level fact that carbocations can exhibit nonclassical\\n\u03C3-delocalization?\\n\\n###
      **1. Reality is confusing, and convincing arguments are often wrong.** {#reality-is-confusing-and-convincing-arguments-are-often-wrong.}\\n\\nIt's
      a good exercise to go back and read the early H.C. Brown papers in\\nthis area,
      like [this\\naccount](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar50071a003). Brown
      was an\\nincredible scientist (the 1979 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and his\\ndata
      and reasoning are quite good; I find myself sympathizing with his\\nviewpoint
      while reading his papers. Nevertheless, with the benefit of\\nhindsight we know
      that he was wrong and Winstein was right. \\\"Humility\\ncomes before honor.\\\"\\n\\n###
      **2. Tools drive scientific progress.** {#tools-drive-scientific-progress.}\\n\\nThe
      argument over the norbornyl cation was ultimately settled only by\\nthe development
      of new techniques, like superacid chemistry, core\\nelectron spectroscopy, and
      high-level calculations. Now that we have\\nthese methods, it's much easier
      to solve similar problems: if Winstein's\\npaper came out today, I doubt it
      would take more than a year or two to\\nfigure everything out.\\n\\nThis aligns
      nicely with what [Freeman\\nDyson](https://estudosdects.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/dyson-science-ideas-or-tools.pdf)\\ncalls
      a \\\"Galisonian\\\" view of scientific progress, where scientific\\nprogress
      is driven not by ideas (the \\\"Kuhnian\\\" view) but by new tools\\nand new
      data. In chemistry, at least, the tools-first view seems true to\\nme---since
      1950, it's difficult to think of a development more important\\nto organic chemistry
      than NMR spectroscopy, with flash column\\nchromatography probably taking second
      place.\\n\\n### **3. It's easy for fields to get distracted by controversy and
      lose relevance.** {#its-easy-for-fields-to-get-distracted-by-controversy-and-lose-relevance.}\\n\\nHere's
      Walling again:\\n\\n> Since a significant fraction of the efforts of physical
      organic\\n> chemists was drawn into the problem \\\\[of the norbornyl cation\\\\],
      an\\n> unhappy consequence was a feeling on the part of many (including some\\n>
      of those concerned with the distribution of research funds) that\\n> physical
      organic chemistry was in danger of withdrawing into a world\\n> of its own.\\n\\nAs
      older scientists have explained to me, the norbornyl cation debacle\\nscared
      a generation of chemists away from physical organic chemistry.\\nThe entire
      subfield became obsessed with a niche and somewhat irrelevant\\nissue, while
      scientists in adjacent subfields looked on with bemusement\\nand frustration.
      As a consequence, traditional physical organic\\nchemistry is barely practiced
      today: few scientists have the skill or\\nknowledge to conduct kinetic studies
      like those performed by Winstein,\\nBrown, and others, and those still working
      in the area struggle to get\\nfunding or recognition (in the words of Dan Singleton,
      [\\\"sucks when you\\nhave to peddle your papers in\\ncemeteries\\\"](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1275932027825664000)).\\n\\n(In
      [a nice historical\\nperspective](http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p123-131.pdf),\\nStephen
      Weininger argues the norbornyl cation debate was \\\"a hook on\\nwhich to hang
      a much larger agenda,\\\" fueled both by a UK/US divide and a\\ndeeper dispute
      about whether valence bond representations or molecular\\norbital representations
      of chemical structures were superior. If this is\\ntrue, it was a self-defeating
      exercise by all involved.)\\n\\nScientists should be motivated by a search for
      truth, but also by the\\ndesire to improve the world. Usually these two aims
      go together: basic\\nresearch without obvious societal implications often leads
      to unexpected\\nand important findings, which is why the government supports
      science in\\nthe first place. But it's possible to become so myopically focused
      on a\\nsingle issue in the name of truth that one forgets about other goals,
      as\\narguably happened in the norbornyl cation imbroglio.\\n\\nControversy attracts
      attention: we're drawn to it, against our better\\njudgment, like moths to a
      flame. We have to be careful not to get\\ncaptured by disputes that are, in
      the long run, not worth the effort.\\n\\n*Thanks to Eric Jacobsen for many conversations
      about the history of\\nphysical organic chemistry, Eugene Kwan for conversations
      about the\\nprinciple of nonperfect synchronization, and to Ari Wagen for feedback\\non
      this post and six months of excellent front-end development for\\nRowan. Any

      Ben Patrick,** ***Knee Ability Zero***.  \n**\\#6. Neal Stephenson,** ***The
      Diamond Age***\n\n*Snow Crash* was much worse upon rereading as an adult, but
      *The Diamond\nAge* was a bit better: in particular, I didn''t really appreciate
      the\n\"speculative governance futurism\"/\"comparative cultural criticism\"\nfacets
      of the novel when I read this in high school.\n\n**\\#7. Richard Hamming,**

      Brandon Sanderson,** ***The Stormlight Archives***\n\nMany great works of literature
      are notable for their brevity: when you\nread Hemingway, or *Dubliners*, or
      Flannery O''Connor, you know that\nevery sentence has been crafted with care.
      Giant fantasy novels like\n*Wheel of Time* (which I read last year) or *The
      Stormlight Archives*\nwork differently. There are entire chapters which are
      probably\nextraneous, whole characters and plot arcs which exist merely to bring\nout
      certain traits or pieces of information.\n\nBut there are unique joys to megafiction:
      sitting down and reading\nhundreds of pages of a good story is relaxing in a
      way that other books\nsimply aren''t. In my own life, I''ve found that I''m
      much better about\nmaking time to read when I''m in the middle of an engaging
      novel than\nwhen I''m reading theology or histories of feudalism. Narrative-driven\n\"easy
      reading\" has a bad reputation amongst the literati; in a world\nwhere all fiction
      is competing against screens for engagement, it\nshouldn''t.\n\n**\\#12. Antonio

      Czeslaw Milocz,** ***The Captive Mind***\n\nFantastic; I probably would have
      liked this even more if I were still in\nschool.\n\n**\\#16. C.S. Lewis,** ***That
      Hideous Strength***\n\nI didn''t like this when I was a kid, but I like it now:
      in many respects\n*THS* can be viewed as a book-length exploration of the ideas
      in \"The\nInner Circle,\" with a garnish of medieval cosmology here and there
      ([see\nalso](http://www.planetnarnia.com/)).\n\n**\\#17. Kazuo Ishiguro,** ***Klara
      and the Sun***  \n**\\#18. Mike Cosper,** ***Recapturing the Wonder***  \n**\\#19.
      Mairtin O Caidhan,** ***Graveyard Clay***\n\nTyler Cowen recommended this book,
      but I didn''t love it.\n\n**\\#20. Ursula K. LeGuin,** ***The Dispossessed***  \n**\\#21.
      Marty Cagan,** ***Inspired***  \n**\\#22. Ernst Junger,** ***On the Marble Cliffs***\n\nThis
      was excellent (h/t [Santi\nRuiz](https://regressstudies.substack.com/p/young-lords-and-their-traces)).\n\n**\\#23.
      Michaeleen Doucleff,** ***Hunt, Gather Parent***\n\nI reviewed this book\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20231106_hgp.html).\n\n**\\#24.

      Geoffrey Chaucer,** ***The Canterbury Tales***\n\nThe best book I read this
      year by a mile; far better than I remembered.\nWhile many of *The Canterbury
      Tales* work pretty well as literature,\nthey''re even better when viewed also
      as history. It''s rare to be able to\nread something from 800 years ago that''s
      legitimately funny and\ninteresting.\n\nReading Chaucer fills me with questions
      about the medieval mind. The\nstories are steeped in Christianity, as one might
      expect. Any argument\ngoes back to the Bible, even those among animals, and
      Chaucer assumes a\nlevel of familiarity with e.g. the Psalms far exceeding that
      of most\nmodern Christians. Yet at the same time the Greco-Roman world looms\nlarge:
      Roman gods appear as plot characters in three tales (the Knight''s\nTale, the
      Merchant''s Tale, and the Manciple''s Tale), and Seneca is\nviewed as a moral
      authority on par with Scripture. I''m curious how all\nthese beliefs and ideas
      fit together and welcome any recommendations on\nthis subject. (*The Discarded
      Image* is already on my list.)\n\n**\\#27. Gabrielle Zevin,** ***Tomorrow and
      Tomorrow and Tomorrow***\n\nMy wife recommended this book to me. I thought this
      would be a relaxing\nbreak from the November startup grind, but in fact it features
      a bunch\nof obsessed programmers working around the clock for months---a poor\nchoice
      but a good novel.\n\n**\\#28. Jessica Livingston,** ***Founders at Work***  \n**\\#29.
      Neal Stephenson,** ***Seveneves***  \n  \n\nOverall, about a third of the books
      I read were startup-related: most of\nthem were pretty bad, but even bad business/startup
      books are probably\nuseful from the viewpoint of cultural immersion. Academic
      science is\nquite different from the startup ecosystem, and to the extent that\ncultural
      arbitrage is possible (in either direction), I need to become\nproficient in
      startup culture.\n\nI''m not sure why the median business book is so bad---perhaps
      business\npeople are too willing to spend money on books and not picky enough,
      or\nperhaps MBA types generally lack knowledge about the humanities, which\nmakes
      both supply and demand worse.\n\n(The median Christian book is also pretty bad.
      One unifying hypothesis:\nboth pastors and businesspeople often have wise insights
      into specific\nsituations, personal or business, but these insights aren''t
      readily\ngeneralizable into book form. Being able to give good advice doesn''t\nmean
      you should write an \"advice book.\")\n\nAs always, book recommendations are
      welcome, particularly on the topics\nof medieval history/culture, software engineering,
      or startups.\nApologies for the infrequent posting as of late, and happy new

      Brandon Sanderson,** ***The Stormlight Archives***\\n\\nMany great works of
      literature are notable for their brevity: when you\\nread Hemingway, or *Dubliners*,
      or Flannery O'Connor, you know that\\nevery sentence has been crafted with care.
      Giant fantasy novels like\\n*Wheel of Time* (which I read last year) or *The
      Stormlight Archives*\\nwork differently. There are entire chapters which are
      probably\\nextraneous, whole characters and plot arcs which exist merely to
      bring\\nout certain traits or pieces of information.\\n\\nBut there are unique
      joys to megafiction: sitting down and reading\\nhundreds of pages of a good
      story is relaxing in a way that other books\\nsimply aren't. In my own life,
      I've found that I'm much better about\\nmaking time to read when I'm in the
      middle of an engaging novel than\\nwhen I'm reading theology or histories of
      feudalism. Narrative-driven\\n\\\"easy reading\\\" has a bad reputation amongst
      the literati; in a world\\nwhere all fiction is competing against screens for
      engagement, it\\nshouldn't.\\n\\n**\\\\#12. Antonio Garcia Mart\xEDnez,** ***Chaos

      Geoffrey Chaucer,** ***The Canterbury Tales***\\n\\nThe best book I read this
      year by a mile; far better than I remembered.\\nWhile many of *The Canterbury
      Tales* work pretty well as literature,\\nthey're even better when viewed also
      as history. It's rare to be able to\\nread something from 800 years ago that's
      legitimately funny and\\ninteresting.\\n\\nReading Chaucer fills me with questions
      about the medieval mind. The\\nstories are steeped in Christianity, as one might
      expect. Any argument\\ngoes back to the Bible, even those among animals, and
      Chaucer assumes a\\nlevel of familiarity with e.g. the Psalms far exceeding
      that of most\\nmodern Christians. Yet at the same time the Greco-Roman world
      looms\\nlarge: Roman gods appear as plot characters in three tales (the Knight's\\nTale,
      the Merchant's Tale, and the Manciple's Tale), and Seneca is\\nviewed as a moral
      authority on par with Scripture. I'm curious how all\\nthese beliefs and ideas
      fit together and welcome any recommendations on\\nthis subject. (*The Discarded
      Image* is already on my list.)\\n\\n**\\\\#27. Gabrielle Zevin,** ***Tomorrow
      and Tomorrow and Tomorrow***\\n\\nMy wife recommended this book to me. I thought
      this would be a relaxing\\nbreak from the November startup grind, but in fact
      it features a bunch\\nof obsessed programmers working around the clock for months---a
      poor\\nchoice but a good novel.\\n\\n**\\\\#28. Jessica Livingston,** ***Founders
      at Work***  \\n**\\\\#29. Neal Stephenson,** ***Seveneves***  \\n  \\n\\nOverall,
      about a third of the books I read were startup-related: most of\\nthem were
      pretty bad, but even bad business/startup books are probably\\nuseful from the
      viewpoint of cultural immersion. Academic science is\\nquite different from
      the startup ecosystem, and to the extent that\\ncultural arbitrage is possible
      (in either direction), I need to become\\nproficient in startup culture.\\n\\nI'm
      not sure why the median business book is so bad---perhaps business\\npeople
      are too willing to spend money on books and not picky enough, or\\nperhaps MBA
      types generally lack knowledge about the humanities, which\\nmakes both supply
      and demand worse.\\n\\n(The median Christian book is also pretty bad. One unifying
      hypothesis:\\nboth pastors and businesspeople often have wise insights into
      specific\\nsituations, personal or business, but these insights aren't readily\\ngeneralizable
      into book form. Being able to give good advice doesn't\\nmean you should write
      an \\\"advice book.\\\")\\n\\nAs always, book recommendations are welcome, particularly
      on the topics\\nof medieval history/culture, software engineering, or startups.\\nApologies

      becomes more and more important to chemistry, it''s\nworth reflecting on Richard
      Sutton''s 2019 blog post about the \"bitter\nlesson.\" In [this now-famous\npost](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html),
      Sutton\nargues that \"the biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI\nresearch
      is that general methods that leverage computation are\nultimately the most effective,
      and by a large margin.\" This might sound\nobvious, but it''s not:\n\n> \\[The
      bitter lesson\\] is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not\n> thoroughly
      learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of\n> mistakes. To see
      this, and to effectively resist it, we have to\n> understand the appeal of these
      mistakes. We have to learn the bitter\n> lesson that building in how we think
      we think does not work in the\n> long run. The bitter lesson is based on the
      historical observations\n> that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build
      knowledge into their\n> agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and
      is personally\n> satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus
      and\n> even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress\n> eventually
      arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling\n> computation by search and
      learning. **The eventual success is tinged\n> with bitterness, and often incompletely
      digested, because it is\n> success over a favored, human-centric approach.**
      *(emphasis added)*\n\nHow might the bitter lesson be relevant in chemistry?
      One example is\ncomputer-assisted retrosynthesis in organic synthesis, i.e.
      figuring out\nhow to make a given target from commercial starting materials.
      This task\nwas first attempted by Corey''s LHASA program\n([1](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2549520/component/file_3325899/content),\n[2](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/corey-lecture.pdf)),
      and\nmore recently has been addressed by Bartosz Gryzbowski''s\n[Synthia](https://www.cell.com/chem/pdf/S2451-9294(18)30085-8.pdf).\nDespite
      considerable successes, both efforts have operated through\nmanual encoding
      of human chemical intuition. If Sutton is to be\nbelieved, we should be pessimistic
      about the scalability and viability\nof such approaches relative to pure search-based
      alternatives in the\ncoming years.\n\nAnother example is machine-learned force
      fields (like ANI or NequIP).\nWhile one could argue that equivariant neural
      networks like *e3nn*\naren''t so much incorporating domain-specific knowledge
      as exploiting\nrelevant symmetries (much like convolutional neural networks
      exploit\ntranslational symmetry in images), there''s been a movement in recent\nyears
      to combine chemistry-specific forces (e.g. long-range Coulombic\nforces) with
      neural networks: Parkhill''s\n[TensorMol](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc04934j)\ndid
      this back in 2018, and more recently\n[Dral](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27340-2),\n[Piquemal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08734),
      and [Levitt &\nFain](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c07628) ([among\nothers](https://twitter.com/olexandr/status/1730604569028092081))
      have\npublished on this as well. While I''m no expert in this area, the bitter\nlesson
      suggests that we should be skeptical about the long-term\nviability of efforts,
      and instead just throw more data at\nchemistry-agnostic models.\n\nA key assumption
      of the bitter lesson is that \"over a slightly longer\ntime than a typical research
      project, massively more computation\ninevitably becomes available.\" This idea
      has also been discussed by\nAndrej Karpathy, who\n[reproduced](https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/)
      Yann\nLeCun''s landmark 1989 backpropagation paper last year using\nstate-of-the-art
      techniques and reflected on how the field has\nprogressed since then. In particular,
      Karpathy discussed how the last\nthree decades of progress in ML can help us
      envision what the next three\ndecades might look like:\n\n> Suppose that the
      lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time.\n> What does that imply about
      deep learning of 2022? What would a time\n> traveler from 2055 think about the
      performance of current networks?\n>\n> - 2055 neural nets are basically the
      same as 2022 neural nets on the\n>   macro level, except bigger.\n>\n> - Our
      datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere\n>   around 10,000,000X
      larger.\n>\n> - One can train 2022 state of the art models in \\~1 minute by
      training\n>   naively on their personal computing device as a weekend fun project.\n>\n>
      - Today''s models are not optimally formulated, and just changing some\n>   of
      the details of the model, loss function, augmentation or the\n>   optimizer
      we can about halve the error.\n>\n> - Our datasets are too small, and modest
      gains would come from scaling\n>   up the dataset alone.\n>\n> - Further gains
      are actually not possible without expanding the\n>   computing infrastructure
      and investing into some R&D on effectively\n>   training models on that scale.\n\nIf
      we take this seriously, we might expect that chemical ML will not be\nable to
      advance much farther without bigger datasets and bigger models.\nToday, experimental
      datasets rarely exceed 10^4^--10^5^ data points, and\neven computational datasets
      typically comprise 10^7^ data points or\nfewer---compare this to the \\~10^13^
      tokens [reportedly used to train\nGPT-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/)!\nIt''s
      not obvious how to get experimental datasets that are this large.\nHTE and robotics
      will help, but five orders of magnitude is a big ask.\nEven all of Reaxys doesn''t
      get you to 10^8^, poor data quality\nnotwithstanding. (It''s probably not a
      coincidence that DNA-encoded\nlibraries, which can actually have hundreds of
      millions of data points,\nalso pair nicely with ML: I''ve written about this\n[before](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230403_industry.html).)\n\nIn
      contrast, computation permits the predictable generation of\nhigh-quality datasets.
      If Sutton is right about the inevitable\navailability of \"massively more computation,\"
      then we can expect it to\nbecome easier and easier to run hitherto expensive
      calculations like DFT\nin parallel to generate huge datasets, and to enable
      more and more\ndownstream applications like chemical machine learning. With
      the right\ninfrastructure (like Rowan, hopefully), it should be possible to
      turn\ncomputer time into high-quality chemical data with almost no\nnon-financial
      scaling limit: [we''re certainly not going to run out of\nmolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300415d).\n\nThe
      advent of big data, though, heralds the decline of academic\nrelevance. Julian
      Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis wrote about this\nearlier this year in a piece
      on [\"survival strategies for depressed AI\nacademics,\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03)
      which discusses the\nfact that \"the gap between the amount of compute available
      to ordinary\nresearchers and the amount available to stay competitive is growing\nevery
      year.\" For instance, GPT-4 reportedly cost c. \\$60 million to\ntrain, far
      surpassing any academic group''s budget. Togelius and\nYannakakis provide a
      lot of potential solutions, some sarcastic (\"give\nup\") and others quite constructive---for
      instance, lots of\ninterpretability work ([like\nthis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html))\nis
      done on toy models that don''t require GPT-4 levels of training. Even\nthe most
      hopeful scenarios they present, however, still leave academics\nwith a rather
      circumscribed role in the ML ecosystem.\n\nThe present academic era of chemical
      machine learning can thus be taken\nas a sign of the field''s immaturity. When
      will chemical ML reach a\nSuttonian era where scaling is paramount and smaller
      efforts become\nincreasingly futile? I''m not sure, but my guess is that it
      will happen\nwhen (and only when) there are clear commercial incentives for\ndeveloping
      sophisticated models, enabling companies to sink massive\namounts of capital
      into training and development. This clearly hasn''t\nhappened yet, but it also
      might not be as far away as it seems\n([cf.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9)).

      Sutton\\nargues that \\\"the biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of

      bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is\\n> success over
      a favored, human-centric approach.** *(emphasis added)*\\n\\nHow might the bitter
      lesson be relevant in chemistry? One example is\\ncomputer-assisted retrosynthesis
      in organic synthesis, i.e. figuring out\\nhow to make a given target from commercial
      starting materials. This task\\nwas first attempted by Corey's LHASA program\\n([1](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2549520/component/file_3325899/content),\\n[2](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/corey-lecture.pdf)),
      and\\nmore recently has been addressed by Bartosz Gryzbowski's\\n[Synthia](https://www.cell.com/chem/pdf/S2451-9294(18)30085-8.pdf).\\nDespite
      considerable successes, both efforts have operated through\\nmanual encoding
      of human chemical intuition. If Sutton is to be\\nbelieved, we should be pessimistic
      about the scalability and viability\\nof such approaches relative to pure search-based
      alternatives in the\\ncoming years.\\n\\nAnother example is machine-learned
      force fields (like ANI or NequIP).\\nWhile one could argue that equivariant
      neural networks like *e3nn*\\naren't so much incorporating domain-specific knowledge
      as exploiting\\nrelevant symmetries (much like convolutional neural networks
      exploit\\ntranslational symmetry in images), there's been a movement in recent\\nyears
      to combine chemistry-specific forces (e.g. long-range Coulombic\\nforces) with
      neural networks: Parkhill's\\n[TensorMol](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c7sc04934j)\\ndid
      this back in 2018, and more recently\\n[Dral](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27340-2),\\n[Piquemal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08734),
      and [Levitt &\\nFain](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c07628) ([among\\nothers](https://twitter.com/olexandr/status/1730604569028092081))
      have\\npublished on this as well. While I'm no expert in this area, the bitter\\nlesson
      suggests that we should be skeptical about the long-term\\nviability of efforts,
      and instead just throw more data at\\nchemistry-agnostic models.\\n\\nA key
      assumption of the bitter lesson is that \\\"over a slightly longer\\ntime than
      a typical research project, massively more computation\\ninevitably becomes
      available.\\\" This idea has also been discussed by\\nAndrej Karpathy, who\\n[reproduced](https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/)
      Yann\\nLeCun's landmark 1989 backpropagation paper last year using\\nstate-of-the-art
      techniques and reflected on how the field has\\nprogressed since then. In particular,
      Karpathy discussed how the last\\nthree decades of progress in ML can help us
      envision what the next three\\ndecades might look like:\\n\\n> Suppose that
      the lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time.\\n> What does that imply
      about deep learning of 2022? What would a time\\n> traveler from 2055 think
      about the performance of current networks?\\n>\\n> - 2055 neural nets are basically
      the same as 2022 neural nets on the\\n>   macro level, except bigger.\\n>\\n>
      - Our datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere\\n>   around
      10,000,000X larger.\\n>\\n> - One can train 2022 state of the art models in
      \\\\~1 minute by training\\n>   naively on their personal computing device as
      a weekend fun project.\\n>\\n> - Today's models are not optimally formulated,
      and just changing some\\n>   of the details of the model, loss function, augmentation
      or the\\n>   optimizer we can about halve the error.\\n>\\n> - Our datasets
      are too small, and modest gains would come from scaling\\n>   up the dataset
      alone.\\n>\\n> - Further gains are actually not possible without expanding the\\n>
      \  computing infrastructure and investing into some R&D on effectively\\n>   training
      models on that scale.\\n\\nIf we take this seriously, we might expect that chemical
      ML will not be\\nable to advance much farther without bigger datasets and bigger
      models.\\nToday, experimental datasets rarely exceed 10^4^--10^5^ data points,
      and\\neven computational datasets typically comprise 10^7^ data points or\\nfewer---compare
      this to the \\\\~10^13^ tokens [reportedly used to train\\nGPT-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/)!\\nIt's
      not obvious how to get experimental datasets that are this large.\\nHTE and
      robotics will help, but five orders of magnitude is a big ask.\\nEven all of
      Reaxys doesn't get you to 10^8^, poor data quality\\nnotwithstanding. (It's
      probably not a coincidence that DNA-encoded\\nlibraries, which can actually
      have hundreds of millions of data points,\\nalso pair nicely with ML: I've written
      about this\\n[before](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230403_industry.html).)\\n\\nIn
      contrast, computation permits the predictable generation of\\nhigh-quality datasets.
      If Sutton is right about the inevitable\\navailability of \\\"massively more
      computation,\\\" then we can expect it to\\nbecome easier and easier to run
      hitherto expensive calculations like DFT\\nin parallel to generate huge datasets,
      and to enable more and more\\ndownstream applications like chemical machine
      learning. With the right\\ninfrastructure (like Rowan, hopefully), it should
      be possible to turn\\ncomputer time into high-quality chemical data with almost
      no\\nnon-financial scaling limit: [we're certainly not going to run out of\\nmolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300415d).\\n\\nThe
      advent of big data, though, heralds the decline of academic\\nrelevance. Julian
      Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis wrote about this\\nearlier this year in a piece
      on [\\\"survival strategies for depressed AI\\nacademics,\\\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03)
      which discusses the\\nfact that \\\"the gap between the amount of compute available
      to ordinary\\nresearchers and the amount available to stay competitive is growing\\nevery
      year.\\\" For instance, GPT-4 reportedly cost c. \\\\$60 million to\\ntrain,
      far surpassing any academic group's budget. Togelius and\\nYannakakis provide
      a lot of potential solutions, some sarcastic (\\\"give\\nup\\\") and others
      quite constructive---for instance, lots of\\ninterpretability work ([like\\nthis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html))\\nis
      done on toy models that don't require GPT-4 levels of training. Even\\nthe most
      hopeful scenarios they present, however, still leave academics\\nwith a rather
      circumscribed role in the ML ecosystem.\\n\\nThe present academic era of chemical
      machine learning can thus be taken\\nas a sign of the field's immaturity. When
      will chemical ML reach a\\nSuttonian era where scaling is paramount and smaller
      efforts become\\nincreasingly futile? I'm not sure, but my guess is that it
      will happen\\nwhen (and only when) there are clear commercial incentives for\\ndeveloping
      sophisticated models, enabling companies to sink massive\\namounts of capital
      into training and development. This clearly hasn't\\nhappened yet, but it also
      might not be as far away as it seems\\n([cf.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9)).

      assumption of the bitter lesson is that \\\"over a slightly longer\\ntime than
      a typical research project, massively more computation\\ninevitably becomes
      available.\\\" This idea has also been discussed by\\nAndrej Karpathy, who\\n[reproduced](https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/)
      Yann\\nLeCun's landmark 1989 backpropagation paper last year using\\nstate-of-the-art
      techniques and reflected on how the field has\\nprogressed since then. In particular,
      Karpathy discussed how the last\\nthree decades of progress in ML can help us
      envision what the next three\\ndecades might look like:\\n\\n> Suppose that
      the lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time.\\n> What does that imply
      about deep learning of 2022? What would a time\\n> traveler from 2055 think
      about the performance of current networks?\\n>\\n> - 2055 neural nets are basically
      the same as 2022 neural nets on the\\n>   macro level, except bigger.\\n>\\n>
      - Our datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere\\n>   around
      10,000,000X larger.\\n>\\n> - One can train 2022 state of the art models in
      \\\\~1 minute by training\\n>   naively on their personal computing device as
      a weekend fun project.\\n>\\n> - Today's models are not optimally formulated,
      and just changing some\\n>   of the details of the model, loss function, augmentation
      or the\\n>   optimizer we can about halve the error.\\n>\\n> - Our datasets
      are too small, and modest gains would come from scaling\\n>   up the dataset
      alone.\\n>\\n> - Further gains are actually not possible without expanding the\\n>
      \  computing infrastructure and investing into some R&D on effectively\\n>   training
      models on that scale.\\n\\nIf we take this seriously, we might expect that chemical
      ML will not be\\nable to advance much farther without bigger datasets and bigger
      models.\\nToday, experimental datasets rarely exceed 10^4^--10^5^ data points,
      and\\neven computational datasets typically comprise 10^7^ data points or\\nfewer---compare
      this to the \\\\~10^13^ tokens [reportedly used to train\\nGPT-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/)!\\nIt's
      not obvious how to get experimental datasets that are this large.\\nHTE and
      robotics will help, but five orders of magnitude is a big ask.\\nEven all of
      Reaxys doesn't get you to 10^8^, poor data quality\\nnotwithstanding. (It's
      probably not a coincidence that DNA-encoded\\nlibraries, which can actually
      have hundreds of millions of data points,\\nalso pair nicely with ML: I've written
      about this\\n[before](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230403_industry.html).)\\n\\nIn
      contrast, computation permits the predictable generation of\\nhigh-quality datasets.
      If Sutton is right about the inevitable\\navailability of \\\"massively more
      computation,\\\" then we can expect it to\\nbecome easier and easier to run
      hitherto expensive calculations like DFT\\nin parallel to generate huge datasets,
      and to enable more and more\\ndownstream applications like chemical machine
      learning. With the right\\ninfrastructure (like Rowan, hopefully), it should
      be possible to turn\\ncomputer time into high-quality chemical data with almost
      no\\nnon-financial scaling limit: [we're certainly not going to run out of\\nmolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci300415d).\\n\\nThe
      advent of big data, though, heralds the decline of academic\\nrelevance. Julian
      Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis wrote about this\\nearlier this year in a piece
      on [\\\"survival strategies for depressed AI\\nacademics,\\\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03)
      which discusses the\\nfact that \\\"the gap between the amount of compute available
      to ordinary\\nresearchers and the amount available to stay competitive is growing\\nevery
      year.\\\" For instance, GPT-4 reportedly cost c. \\\\$60 million to\\ntrain,
      far surpassing any academic group's budget. Togelius and\\nYannakakis provide
      a lot of potential solutions, some sarcastic (\\\"give\\nup\\\") and others
      quite constructive---for instance, lots of\\ninterpretability work ([like\\nthis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html))\\nis
      done on toy models that don't require GPT-4 levels of training. Even\\nthe most
      hopeful scenarios they present, however, still leave academics\\nwith a rather
      circumscribed role in the ML ecosystem.\\n\\nThe present academic era of chemical
      machine learning can thus be taken\\nas a sign of the field's immaturity. When
      will chemical ML reach a\\nSuttonian era where scaling is paramount and smaller
      efforts become\\nincreasingly futile? I'm not sure, but my guess is that it
      will happen\\nwhen (and only when) there are clear commercial incentives for\\ndeveloping
      sophisticated models, enabling companies to sink massive\\namounts of capital
      into training and development. This clearly hasn't\\nhappened yet, but it also
      might not be as far away as it seems\\n([cf.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9)).

      pistol course in undergrad, and while I was a poor marksman I\nenjoyed the experience.
      In particular, I was surprised by how meditative\nthe act of shooting was. As
      our instructor explained, much of good\nshooting comes down to not doing anything
      when you pull the trigger.\nWhen you''re not firing, it''s easy to point a gun
      at a target and line up\nthe sights, but as you pull the trigger you subconsciously
      anticipate\nthe noise and movement of the pistol blast, which makes you flinch
      and\npull the gun off-target. Being a good shooter thus requires consciously\nlearning
      to counteract what your instincts tell you to do.\n\nIf you believe Bill Carr
      and Colin Bryar''s book on Amazon, *[Working\nBackwards](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1250267595)*,\nAmazon''s
      success can be understood in similar terms. According to Carr\nand Bryar, Amazon
      alone among the West Coast zaibatsu has succeeded not\nbecause of some big technical
      or social insight (Google Search, Windows)\nbut because of a long series of
      canny business decisions. Bezos has said\nsomething similar: \"Amazon doesn\\''t
      have one big advantage, so we have\nto braid a rope out of many small advantages.\"
      The implication is that\nyou too can build an Amazon-quality firm; you don''t
      need any flashes of\nmad genius, just the ability to eke out small advantages
      through savvy\nmanagement.\n\n(This might seem like an insane claim, but it''s
      worth noting that Amazon\nhas indeed launched a ton of successful and loosely
      coupled businesses:\nin addition to their core commerce business, there''s AWS,
      Amazon\nRobotics, Kindle, Prime Video, Fire TV, and a bunch of other stuff.\nContrast
      this to Google''s recent track record...)\n\nWhat''s more, Carr and Bryar go
      on to argue that Amazon''s business acumen\nis driven not by some inscrutable
      Bezos magic but by adherence to a\nsimple set of principles. And these principles
      aren''t esoteric or\nAmazon-specific---almost any business can follow them.
      The reason so few\nbusinesses have copied Amazon''s success is simply because
      each principle\ndefies human nature in some way. Just like pistol shooting requires
      one\nto unlearn one''s instincts and pull the trigger without moving any other\nmuscles,
      being an \"Amazonian\" business requires discarding what you\nthink you understand
      about building a business and going back to basics.\n\nSo, what are these magic
      principles?\n\n## **1. Focus on Customers, Not Competitors** {#focus-on-customers-not-competitors}\n\nFocusing
      on competitors is human nature---in a competition, we judge\nourselves based
      on our rivals, and like to imagine how we''ll defeat\nthem. But success in business
      comes from satisfied customers, not\nvanquished foes, and keeping a relentless
      focus on users/customers is\nwhat''s key to building something great. This is
      hardly Amazon-specific\nadvice: \"build something people want\" is [venerable
      YC\nadvice](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice),\nand
      *Zero to One* also makes the point that competition is bad, and\nfocusing on
      it counterproductive. Perhaps the fact that so many\ndifferent people feel the
      need to emphasize this speaks to the fact that\nit''s very counterintuitive:
      if it were widely adopted, it wouldn''t need\nto be said.\n\nPlenty of people
      outside business get this idea wrong. A few weeks ago,\na friend was explaining
      how he feels that many computational chemists\nare making software not for users
      but for other computational chemists.\nThis is a case in which writing papers
      leads to different incentives\nthan releasing products: papers are reviewed
      by one''s peers (other\ncomputational chemists), while products are ultimately
      reviewed by\nusers. Hopefully Rowan doesn''t make this mistake...\n\n## **2.
      \"Bar Raisers\": External Vetos in Hiring** {#bar-raisers-external-vetos-in-hiring}\n\nAmazon
      includes a person called a \"Bar Raiser\" involved in all hiring\ndecisions,
      who isn''t the hiring manager (the person who is trying to\nacquire a new team
      member) but who has final veto power on any potential\nhire. The hiring manager
      is hiring because they need help in the short\nterm, so they''re typically willing
      to engage in wishful thinking and\nlower their standards---but the Bar Raiser
      (who''s just another Amazon\nemployee, with a bit of extra training) has no
      such incentives and can\nmake sure that no poor performers are hired, which
      is better for Amazon\nin the long run.\n\nI like this idea because it''s a nice
      example of mechanism design: just a\nlittle bit of internal red-teaming on all
      decisions, which (according to\nthe book) works quite well. (Red teaming is
      another one of those \"good\nbut counterintuitive practices\" which seems underutilized---see
      [the\ndiscussion](https://open.substack.com/pub/statecraftnotes/p/how-to-predict-the-future?r=5jsaw&selection=302a6711-1b29-4791-aedc-0320932bac7a&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web)\nin
      a recent *Statecraft* interview.)\n\n## **3. Problem-Focused, Not Skills-Focused**
      {#problem-focused-not-skills-focused}\n\nIt''s natural to think about what we
      should do next in terms of what\nwe''re good at: \"I''m good at X, how can I
      use X to solve a problem?\" Carr\nand Bryar argue that \"working forwards\"
      in this way is stupid, because\nonly at the end do you think about who (if anyone)
      might care if you\nsucceed. \"Working backwards\" from problem to solution is
      a much better\nstrategy: first you articulate what you might need to accomplish
      to\nproduce a compelling solution, and then you think about if you can do\nit.
      Inside Amazon, most potential new projects start out by drafting\nwhat the press
      release might be if the project is finished, and then\nworking backwards from
      the press release to what the product must be.\n(Most products envisioned in
      this way never actually get developed,\nwhich is exactly the point of the exercise.)\n\n[George\nWhitesides](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf)\nhas
      advocated for a similar way to approach science: first write the\npaper, then
      conduct the experiments. Lots of scientists I know find this\nrepulsive, or
      contrary to how science should be practiced, but it always\nseemed shrewd to
      me---if you can''t make an interesting paper out of what\nyou''re doing, why
      are you doing it? (Some exploratory work is tough to\noutline in this way, but
      there should be several potential papers in\nthose cases, not none.)\n\n## **4.
      Single-Threaded Leadership** {#single-threaded-leadership}\n\nAs organizations
      scale, it becomes tougher and tougher to allow teams to\nwork autonomously:
      to quote Amazon SVP of Devices Dave Limp: \"The best\nway to fail at inventing
      something is by making it somebody''s part-time\njob.\" Amazon''s solution is
      the idea of single-threaded leadership (STL,\nprobably someone''s idea of C++
      humor). Organizations need to be arranged\nsuch that individual teams can respond
      to their problems intelligently\nand independently, planning and shipping features
      on their own, and each\nteam needs to have a \"single-threaded leader\" who''s
      solely responsible\nfor that team.\n\nInstituting STL takes a good amount of
      initial planning, since dividing\nup a giant monolith into loosely coupled components
      is tough both for\nsoftware and for humans, and it''s not in the nature of authorities
      to\nrelinquish control. If done properly, though, this allows innovation to\nhappen
      much faster than if every decision is bottlenecked by reliance on\nthe C-suite.
      (It''s sorta like federalism for businesses.)\n\nThis idea matters for labs,
      too: some research groups rely on their PI\nfor scientific direction in every
      project, while others devolve a lot of\nauthority to individual students. The
      latter seem more productive to me.\n\n## **5. Bias Towards Action** {#bias-towards-action}\n\nHumans
      are by nature conservative, and sins of commission frequently\nfeel worse than
      sins of omission---making a bad decision can cost you\nyour job, while not making
      a good decision often goes unnoticed (the\n[\"invisible\ngraveyard\"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html)).\nTo
      counteract this, Amazon expects leaders to display a \"Bias for\nAction.\" In
      their words:\n\n> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are
      reversible\n> and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.\n\nAgain,
      this echoes classic startup advice: \"launch now,\" \"do things that\ndon''t
      scale,\" &c.\n\n## **6. No Powerpoint!** {#no-powerpoint}\n\nIn June 2004, Amazon
      banned PowerPoint presentations from meetings,\ninstead expecting presenters
      to compose six-page documents which the\nentire team would read, silently, at
      the beginning of each meeting. Why?\nA few reasons:\n\n- PowerPoint lends itself
      poorly to complex or nuanced ideas, whereas\n  written documents can contain
      more information and more complete\n  chains of reasoning.\n\n- PowerPoint leads
      to \"slick,\" well-rehearsed presentations where the\n  presenter''s style and
      charisma matters as much as the underlying\n  ideas.\n\n- Writing enforces greater
      clarity of thought than speaking.\n\n- PowerPoint makes the audience passive,
      while reading makes the\n  audience active participants in the ideas. People
      like to be passive,\n  and it''s fun to hear an inspiring presentation, but
      in the long run\n  it''s better for everyone to actually engage.\n\nI''m pretty
      sympathetic to these criticisms. Most high-stakes academic\nevents today revolve
      around oral presentations, not papers---although\npapers still matter, doctorates,
      job offers, and tenure are awarded\nlargely on the merits of hour-long talks\n([e.g.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HeQGQQ0q8)).
      As a result, I\nspent a ridiculous amount of my PhD just refining and hearing
      feedback\non my presentations, much of which had nothing to do with the underlying\nscientific
      ideas. Perhaps this focus on showmanship over substance\nexplains why so little
      science today seems genuinely transformational.\n(It''s also worth noting that
      presenting, much more so than writing,\nfavors charismatic Americans over the
      meek or foreign.)\n\nThere are, of course, more than just these six ideas in
      *Working\nBackwards*, but I think this gives a pretty good sense of what the
      book\nis like. Overall, I''d recommend this book: it was interesting throughout\n(unlike
      most business-y books), and even if nothing in its covers is\ntruly new under
      the sun, the ideas inside are good enough to be worth\nreviewing periodically.\n",

      to engage in wishful thinking and\nlower their standards---but the Bar Raiser
      (who''s just another Amazon\nemployee, with a bit of extra training) has no
      such incentives and can\nmake sure that no poor performers are hired, which
      is better for Amazon\nin the long run.\n\nI like this idea because it''s a nice
      example of mechanism design: just a\nlittle bit of internal red-teaming on all
      decisions, which (according to\nthe book) works quite well. (Red teaming is
      another one of those \"good\nbut counterintuitive practices\" which seems underutilized---see
      [the\ndiscussion](https://open.substack.com/pub/statecraftnotes/p/how-to-predict-the-future?r=5jsaw&selection=302a6711-1b29-4791-aedc-0320932bac7a&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web)\nin
      a recent *Statecraft* interview.)\n\n## **3. Problem-Focused, Not Skills-Focused**
      {#problem-focused-not-skills-focused}\n\nIt''s natural to think about what we
      should do next in terms of what\nwe''re good at: \"I''m good at X, how can I
      use X to solve a problem?\" Carr\nand Bryar argue that \"working forwards\"
      in this way is stupid, because\nonly at the end do you think about who (if anyone)
      might care if you\nsucceed. \"Working backwards\" from problem to solution is
      a much better\nstrategy: first you articulate what you might need to accomplish
      to\nproduce a compelling solution, and then you think about if you can do\nit.
      Inside Amazon, most potential new projects start out by drafting\nwhat the press
      release might be if the project is finished, and then\nworking backwards from
      the press release to what the product must be.\n(Most products envisioned in
      this way never actually get developed,\nwhich is exactly the point of the exercise.)\n\n[George\nWhitesides](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf)\nhas
      advocated for a similar way to approach science: first write the\npaper, then
      conduct the experiments. Lots of scientists I know find this\nrepulsive, or
      contrary to how science should be practiced, but it always\nseemed shrewd to
      me---if you can''t make an interesting paper out of what\nyou''re doing, why
      are you doing it? (Some exploratory work is tough to\noutline in this way, but
      there should be several potential papers in\nthose cases, not none.)\n\n## **4.
      Single-Threaded Leadership** {#single-threaded-leadership}\n\nAs organizations
      scale, it becomes tougher and tougher to allow teams to\nwork autonomously:
      to quote Amazon SVP of Devices Dave Limp: \"The best\nway to fail at inventing
      something is by making it somebody''s part-time\njob.\" Amazon''s solution is
      the idea of single-threaded leadership (STL,\nprobably someone''s idea of C++
      humor). Organizations need to be arranged\nsuch that individual teams can respond
      to their problems intelligently\nand independently, planning and shipping features
      on their own, and each\nteam needs to have a \"single-threaded leader\" who''s
      solely responsible\nfor that team.\n\nInstituting STL takes a good amount of
      initial planning, since dividing\nup a giant monolith into loosely coupled components
      is tough both for\nsoftware and for humans, and it''s not in the nature of authorities
      to\nrelinquish control. If done properly, though, this allows innovation to\nhappen
      much faster than if every decision is bottlenecked by reliance on\nthe C-suite.
      (It''s sorta like federalism for businesses.)\n\nThis idea matters for labs,
      too: some research groups rely on their PI\nfor scientific direction in every
      project, while others devolve a lot of\nauthority to individual students. The
      latter seem more productive to me.\n\n## **5. Bias Towards Action** {#bias-towards-action}\n\nHumans
      are by nature conservative, and sins of commission frequently\nfeel worse than
      sins of omission---making a bad decision can cost you\nyour job, while not making
      a good decision often goes unnoticed (the\n[\"invisible\ngraveyard\"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html)).\nTo
      counteract this, Amazon expects leaders to display a \"Bias for\nAction.\" In
      their words:\n\n> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are
      reversible\n> and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.\n\nAgain,
      this echoes classic startup advice: \"launch now,\" \"do things that\ndon''t
      scale,\" &c.\n\n## **6. No Powerpoint!** {#no-powerpoint}\n\nIn June 2004, Amazon
      banned PowerPoint presentations from meetings,\ninstead expecting presenters
      to compose six-page documents which the\nentire team would read, silently, at
      the beginning of each meeting. Why?\nA few reasons:\n\n- PowerPoint lends itself
      poorly to complex or nuanced ideas, whereas\n  written documents can contain
      more information and more complete\n  chains of reasoning.\n\n- PowerPoint leads
      to \"slick,\" well-rehearsed presentations where the\n  presenter''s style and
      charisma matters as much as the underlying\n  ideas.\n\n- Writing enforces greater
      clarity of thought than speaking.\n\n- PowerPoint makes the audience passive,
      while reading makes the\n  audience active participants in the ideas. People
      like to be passive,\n  and it''s fun to hear an inspiring presentation, but
      in the long run\n  it''s better for everyone to actually engage.\n\nI''m pretty
      sympathetic to these criticisms. Most high-stakes academic\nevents today revolve
      around oral presentations, not papers---although\npapers still matter, doctorates,
      job offers, and tenure are awarded\nlargely on the merits of hour-long talks\n([e.g.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HeQGQQ0q8)).
      As a result, I\nspent a ridiculous amount of my PhD just refining and hearing
      feedback\non my presentations, much of which had nothing to do with the underlying\nscientific
      ideas. Perhaps this focus on showmanship over substance\nexplains why so little
      science today seems genuinely transformational.\n(It''s also worth noting that
      presenting, much more so than writing,\nfavors charismatic Americans over the
      meek or foreign.)\n\nThere are, of course, more than just these six ideas in
      *Working\nBackwards*, but I think this gives a pretty good sense of what the
      book\nis like. Overall, I''d recommend this book: it was interesting throughout\n(unlike
      most business-y books), and even if nothing in its covers is\ntruly new under
      the sun, the ideas inside are good enough to be worth\nreviewing periodically.\n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"139156573","updated":false,"category":"chemicalSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      took a pistol course in undergrad, and while I was a poor marksman I\nenjoyed
      the experience. In particular, I was surprised by how meditative\nthe act of
      shooting was. As our instructor explained, much of good\nshooting comes down
      to not doing anything when you pull the trigger.\nWhen you''re not firing, it''s
      easy to point a gun at a target and line up\nthe sights, but as you pull the
      trigger you subconsciously anticipate\nthe noise and movement of the pistol
      blast, which makes you flinch and\npull the gun off-target. Being a good shooter
      thus requires consciously\nlearning to counteract what your instincts tell you
      to do.\n\nIf you believe Bill Carr and Colin Bryar''s book on Amazon, *[Working\nBackwards](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1250267595)*,\nAmazon''s
      success can be understood in similar terms. According to Carr\nand Bryar, Amazon
      alone among the West Coast zaibatsu has succeeded not\nbecause of some big technical
      or social insight (Google Search, Windows)\nbut because of a long series of
      canny business decisions. Bezos has said\nsomething similar: \"Amazon doesn\\''t
      have one big advantage, so we have\nto braid a rope out of many small advantages.\"
      The implication is that\nyou too can build an Amazon-quality firm; you don''t
      need any flashes of\nmad genius, just the ability to eke out small advantages
      through savvy\nmanagement.\n\n(This might seem like an insane claim, but it''s
      worth noting that Amazon\nhas indeed launched a ton of successful and loosely
      coupled businesses:\nin addition to their core commerce business, there''s AWS,
      Amazon\nRobotics, Kindle, Prime Video, Fire TV, and a bunch of other stuff.\nContrast
      this to Google''s recent track record...)\n\nWhat''s more, Carr and Bryar go
      on to argue that Amazon''s business acumen\nis driven not by some inscrutable
      Bezos magic but by adherence to a\nsimple set of principles. And these principles
      aren''t esoteric or\nAmazon-specific---almost any business can follow them.
      The reason so few\nbusinesses have copied Amazon''s success is simply because
      each principle\ndefies human nature in some way. Just like pistol shooting requires
      one\nto unlearn one''s instincts and pull the trigger without moving any other\nmuscles,
      being an \"Amazonian\" business requires discarding what you\nthink you understand
      about building a business and going back to basics.\n\nSo, what are these magic
      principles?\n\n## **1. Focus on Customers, Not Competitors** {#focus-on-customers-not-competitors}\n\nFocusing
      on competitors is human nature---in a competition, we judge\nourselves based
      on our rivals, and like to imagine how we''ll defeat\nthem. But success in business
      comes from satisfied customers, not\nvanquished foes, and keeping a relentless
      focus on users/customers is\nwhat''s key to building something great. This is
      hardly Amazon-specific\nadvice: \"build something people want\" is [venerable
      YC\nadvice](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice),\nand
      *Zero to One* also makes the point that competition is bad, and\nfocusing on
      it counterproductive. Perhaps the fact that so many\ndifferent people feel the
      need to emphasize this speaks to the fact that\nit''s very counterintuitive:
      if it were widely adopted, it wouldn''t need\nto be said.\n\nPlenty of people
      outside business get this idea wrong. A few weeks ago,\na friend was explaining
      how he feels that many computational chemists\nare making software not for users
      but for other computational chemists.\nThis is a case in which writing papers
      leads to different incentives\nthan releasing products: papers are reviewed
      by one''s peers (other\ncomputational chemists), while products are ultimately
      reviewed by\nusers. Hopefully Rowan doesn''t make this mistake...\n\n## **2.
      \"Bar Raisers\": External Vetos in Hiring** {#bar-raisers-external-vetos-in-hiring}\n\nAmazon
      includes a person called a \"Bar Raiser\" involved in all hiring\ndecisions,
      who isn''t the hiring manager (the person who is trying to\nacquire a new team
      member) but who has final veto power on any potential\nhire. The hiring manager
      is hiring because they need help in the short\nterm, so they''re typically willing
      to engage in wishful thinking and\nlower their standards---but the Bar Raiser
      (who''s just another Amazon\nemployee, with a bit of extra training) has no

      (1892), another Westerner\nlooking for enlightenment among \u201cvenerable cultures.\u201d</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhat
      if our most fundamental assumptions about parenting were wrong?\nThat''s the
      question that Michaeleen Doucleff''s 2021 book *Hunt, Gather,\nParent* tries
      to tackle. *Hunt, Gather, Parent* (henceforth *HGP*)\ndocuments Doucleff''s
      journey to \"three of the world''s most venerable\ncultures\"---the Maya, the
      Inuit, and the Hadzabe (in Tanzania)---to\nlearn about how they parent their
      children, and offers helpful advice\nfor parents envious of the kind, helpful,
      and responsible children she\nobserves.\n\nDoucleff''s writing hits some familiar
      beats: critiques of helicopter\nparenting, distrust of endless after-school
      activities, and laments\nabout the atomization of our society\n([cf.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306232837/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)).\nBut
      there are plenty of unexpected insights too. I was convicted by her\naccount
      of how Hadzabe children are given autonomy and responsibilities\nfrom a young
      age without being either ignored or micromanaged: her\nvision of a middle ground
      between *K*-selected \"helicopter parents\" and\n*r*-selected \"free-range parents\"
      was compelling.\n\nThere''s a lot to like about the parenting depicted in *HGP*.
      For\ninstance, Doucleff highlights how toddlers'' innate eagerness to help is\nused
      by the Maya to build a culture of helpfulness (the virtue she calls\n*acomedido*)
      which lasts as they grow, whereas American parents\ngenerally disregard help
      from a toddler and thus teach kids that their\nhelp isn''t valued. On the other
      hand, I''m not compelled by her account\nof how the Inuit view conflict with
      their children:\n\n> Inuit see arguing with children as silly and a waste of
      time...\n> because children are pretty much illogical beings. When an adult\n>
      argues with a child, the adult stoops to the child''s level... During\n> my
      three visits to the Arctic, I never once witness a parent argue\n> with a child.
      I never see a power struggle. I never hear nagging or\n> negotiating. Never.\n\nI
      admit that getting into a shouting match with your toddler is\npointless, but
      assuming that children are innately devoid of logic seems\nlike an overreaction!\n\nAstute
      readers might be getting bothered by now, though: why are the\nMaya---who ruled
      a swath of Central America for over a\nmillennium---included in a book ostensibly
      about \"hunter-gatherers and\nother indigenous cultures with similar values\"?
      This highlights a deeper\nissue I have with *HGP*, which is that it partitions
      the world neatly\ninto \"Westerners\" and \"everyone else,\" citing Joseph Heinrich''s
      *[The\nWEIRDest People in the\nWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World)*\nas
      its justification. While there are certainly many ways in which our\nown culture
      is distinct, ours is but one among many, and there''s plenty\nof cultural diversity
      about which *HGP* is silent.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dfe76c6-444c-4e67-808c-46a9302ad388_1200x627.jpeg\"\nclass=\"image-link

      \"Roman law understands the legal power of the *pater familias* within\n  the
      familia to be absolute, to the point of being able to put any\n  member to death
      (this seems to have almost never happened, but it was\n  legally permitted)\"
      ([Bret\n  Devereaux](https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/))\n\n-
      Yan Zhitui (Northern and Southern Dynasties, late 6th century) writes\n  that
      \"...as soon as a baby can recognize facial expressions and\n  understand approval
      and disapproval, training should be begun so that\n  he will do what he is told
      to do and stop when so ordered. After a few\n  years of this, punishment with
      the bamboo can be minimized, as\n  parental strictness and dignity mingled with
      parental love will lead\n  the boys and girls to a feeling of respect and caution
      and give rise\n  to filial piety. I have noticed about me that where there is
      merely\n  love without training this result is never achieved.\" ([quoted\n  here](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/cup/yan_house_instructions.pdf))\n\n(Granted,
      these cultures aren''t \"indigenous,\" but then neither are the\nMaya.)\n\nDoucleff''s
      focus on partitioning the world into \"the West\" and \"the\nrest\" blinds her
      to deeper and more interesting questions. The way we\nparent reflects our values---there
      are no perfect choices in parenting,\njust tradeoffs all the way down. Our culture''s
      valorization of grindset\nlikely helps us instill ambition and a work ethic
      in our children, but\nalso probably sets them up for depression and other issues
      down the\nroad. Is this a good trade? Absent an ethical framework, it''s tough
      to\nsay, but *HGP* doesn''t even acknowledge the question.\n\nThere''s a deeper
      truth here, which is that rejecting the status quo\nisn''t the same as proposing
      an alternative. It''s not unfair to read\n*HGP* as an account of Doucleff becoming
      redpilled on parenting and\nrealizing that all her assumptions about how to
      raise her children might\nbe wrong---but, like many of the newly redpilled,
      Doucleff lingers too\nlong in her rebellion and doesn''t (in *HGP*) articulate
      a satisfying\npositive vision for what parenting should be. There are innumerable\ncultures
      out there, each of which doubtless parents in a different way,\nand choosing
      what practices to adopt from each tradition requires\nwisdom.\n\nBut these aren''t
      choices we should want Doucleff to make for us. In the\nintroduction to *HGP*,
      Doucleff writes that \"as we move outside the\nU.S., we''ll start to see the
      Western approach to parenting with fresh\neyes,\" and this seems true. *HGP*
      prompts us to reflect on the choices\nwe make as parents and the ways in which
      we might choose differently,\nand even if you disagree with all of Doucleff''s
      advice it''s worth\nreading for this experience alone.\n\n*Thanks to my wife

      cultures.\u201D</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhat if our most fundamental
      assumptions about parenting were wrong?\\nThat's the question that Michaeleen
      Doucleff's 2021 book *Hunt, Gather,\\nParent* tries to tackle. *Hunt, Gather,
      Parent* (henceforth *HGP*)\\ndocuments Doucleff's journey to \\\"three of the
      world's most venerable\\ncultures\\\"---the Maya, the Inuit, and the Hadzabe
      (in Tanzania)---to\\nlearn about how they parent their children, and offers
      helpful advice\\nfor parents envious of the kind, helpful, and responsible children
      she\\nobserves.\\n\\nDoucleff's writing hits some familiar beats: critiques
      of helicopter\\nparenting, distrust of endless after-school activities, and
      laments\\nabout the atomization of our society\\n([cf.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306232837/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)).\\nBut
      there are plenty of unexpected insights too. I was convicted by her\\naccount
      of how Hadzabe children are given autonomy and responsibilities\\nfrom a young
      age without being either ignored or micromanaged: her\\nvision of a middle ground
      between *K*-selected \\\"helicopter parents\\\" and\\n*r*-selected \\\"free-range
      parents\\\" was compelling.\\n\\nThere's a lot to like about the parenting depicted
      in *HGP*. For\\ninstance, Doucleff highlights how toddlers' innate eagerness
      to help is\\nused by the Maya to build a culture of helpfulness (the virtue
      she calls\\n*acomedido*) which lasts as they grow, whereas American parents\\ngenerally
      disregard help from a toddler and thus teach kids that their\\nhelp isn't valued.
      On the other hand, I'm not compelled by her account\\nof how the Inuit view
      conflict with their children:\\n\\n> Inuit see arguing with children as silly
      and a waste of time...\\n> because children are pretty much illogical beings.
      When an adult\\n> argues with a child, the adult stoops to the child's level...
      During\\n> my three visits to the Arctic, I never once witness a parent argue\\n>
      with a child. I never see a power struggle. I never hear nagging or\\n> negotiating.
      Never.\\n\\nI admit that getting into a shouting match with your toddler is\\npointless,
      but assuming that children are innately devoid of logic seems\\nlike an overreaction!\\n\\nAstute
      readers might be getting bothered by now, though: why are the\\nMaya---who ruled
      a swath of Central America for over a\\nmillennium---included in a book ostensibly
      about \\\"hunter-gatherers and\\nother indigenous cultures with similar values\\\"?
      This highlights a deeper\\nissue I have with *HGP*, which is that it partitions
      the world neatly\\ninto \\\"Westerners\\\" and \\\"everyone else,\\\" citing
      Joseph Heinrich's *[The\\nWEIRDest People in the\\nWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World)*\\nas
      its justification. While there are certainly many ways in which our\\nown culture

      understands the legal power of the *pater familias* within\\n  the familia to
      be absolute, to the point of being able to put any\\n  member to death (this
      seems to have almost never happened, but it was\\n  legally permitted)\\\" ([Bret\\n

      Yan Zhitui (Northern and Southern Dynasties, late 6th century) writes\\n  that
      \\\"...as soon as a baby can recognize facial expressions and\\n  understand
      approval and disapproval, training should be begun so that\\n  he will do what
      he is told to do and stop when so ordered. After a few\\n  years of this, punishment
      with the bamboo can be minimized, as\\n  parental strictness and dignity mingled
      with parental love will lead\\n  the boys and girls to a feeling of respect
      and caution and give rise\\n  to filial piety. I have noticed about me that
      where there is merely\\n  love without training this result is never achieved.\\\"
      ([quoted\\n  here](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/cup/yan_house_instructions.pdf))\\n\\n(Granted,
      these cultures aren't \\\"indigenous,\\\" but then neither are the\\nMaya.)\\n\\nDoucleff's
      focus on partitioning the world into \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the\\nrest\\\"
      blinds her to deeper and more interesting questions. The way we\\nparent reflects
      our values---there are no perfect choices in parenting,\\njust tradeoffs all
      the way down. Our culture's valorization of grindset\\nlikely helps us instill
      ambition and a work ethic in our children, but\\nalso probably sets them up
      for depression and other issues down the\\nroad. Is this a good trade? Absent
      an ethical framework, it's tough to\\nsay, but *HGP* doesn't even acknowledge
      the question.\\n\\nThere's a deeper truth here, which is that rejecting the
      status quo\\nisn't the same as proposing an alternative. It's not unfair to
      read\\n*HGP* as an account of Doucleff becoming redpilled on parenting and\\nrealizing
      that all her assumptions about how to raise her children might\\nbe wrong---but,
      like many of the newly redpilled, Doucleff lingers too\\nlong in her rebellion
      and doesn't (in *HGP*) articulate a satisfying\\npositive vision for what parenting
      should be. There are innumerable\\ncultures out there, each of which doubtless
      parents in a different way,\\nand choosing what practices to adopt from each
      tradition requires\\nwisdom.\\n\\nBut these aren't choices we should want Doucleff
      to make for us. In the\\nintroduction to *HGP*, Doucleff writes that \\\"as
      we move outside the\\nU.S., we'll start to see the Western approach to parenting
      with fresh\\neyes,\\\" and this seems true. *HGP* prompts us to reflect on the
      choices\\nwe make as parents and the ways in which we might choose differently,\\nand
      even if you disagree with all of Doucleff's advice it's worth\\nreading for
      this experience alone.\\n\\n*Thanks to my wife for recommending this book to
      me, and for helpful\\ndiscussions.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"138648645\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      Gaugain (1892), another Westerner\\nlooking for enlightenment among \u201Cvenerable
      cultures.\u201D</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhat if our most fundamental
      assumptions about parenting were wrong?\\nThat's the question that Michaeleen
      Doucleff's 2021 book *Hunt, Gather,\\nParent* tries to tackle. *Hunt, Gather,
      Parent* (henceforth *HGP*)\\ndocuments Doucleff's journey to \\\"three of the
      world's most venerable\\ncultures\\\"---the Maya, the Inuit, and the Hadzabe
      (in Tanzania)---to\\nlearn about how they parent their children, and offers
      helpful advice\\nfor parents envious of the kind, helpful, and responsible children
      she\\nobserves.\\n\\nDoucleff's writing hits some familiar beats: critiques
      of helicopter\\nparenting, distrust of endless after-school activities, and
      laments\\nabout the atomization of our society\\n([cf.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306232837/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)).\\nBut
      there are plenty of unexpected insights too. I was convicted by her\\naccount
      of how Hadzabe children are given autonomy and responsibilities\\nfrom a young
      age without being either ignored or micromanaged: her\\nvision of a middle ground
      between *K*-selected \\\"helicopter parents\\\" and\\n*r*-selected \\\"free-range
      parents\\\" was compelling.\\n\\nThere's a lot to like about the parenting depicted
      in *HGP*. For\\ninstance, Doucleff highlights how toddlers' innate eagerness
      to help is\\nused by the Maya to build a culture of helpfulness (the virtue
      she calls\\n*acomedido*) which lasts as they grow, whereas American parents\\ngenerally
      disregard help from a toddler and thus teach kids that their\\nhelp isn't valued.
      On the other hand, I'm not compelled by her account\\nof how the Inuit view
      conflict with their children:\\n\\n> Inuit see arguing with children as silly
      and a waste of time...\\n> because children are pretty much illogical beings.
      When an adult\\n> argues with a child, the adult stoops to the child's level...
      During\\n> my three visits to the Arctic, I never once witness a parent argue\\n>
      with a child. I never see a power struggle. I never hear nagging or\\n> negotiating.
      Never.\\n\\nI admit that getting into a shouting match with your toddler is\\npointless,
      but assuming that children are innately devoid of logic seems\\nlike an overreaction!\\n\\nAstute
      readers might be getting bothered by now, though: why are the\\nMaya---who ruled
      a swath of Central America for over a\\nmillennium---included in a book ostensibly
      about \\\"hunter-gatherers and\\nother indigenous cultures with similar values\\\"?
      This highlights a deeper\\nissue I have with *HGP*, which is that it partitions
      the world neatly\\ninto \\\"Westerners\\\" and \\\"everyone else,\\\" citing
      Joseph Heinrich's *[The\\nWEIRDest People in the\\nWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World)*\\nas
      its justification. While there are certainly many ways in which our\\nown culture
      is distinct, ours is but one among many, and there's plenty\\nof cultural diversity
      about which *HGP* is silent.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dfe76c6-444c-4e67-808c-46a9302ad388_1200x627.jpeg\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      he is told to do and stop when so ordered. After a few\\n  years of this, punishment
      with the bamboo can be minimized, as\\n  parental strictness and dignity mingled
      with parental love will lead\\n  the boys and girls to a feeling of respect
      and caution and give rise\\n  to filial piety. I have noticed about me that
      where there is merely\\n  love without training this result is never achieved.\\\"

      these cultures aren't \\\"indigenous,\\\" but then neither are the\\nMaya.)\\n\\nDoucleff's
      focus on partitioning the world into \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the\\nrest\\\"
      blinds her to deeper and more interesting questions. The way we\\nparent reflects
      our values---there are no perfect choices in parenting,\\njust tradeoffs all
      the way down. Our culture's valorization of grindset\\nlikely helps us instill
      ambition and a work ethic in our children, but\\nalso probably sets them up
      for depression and other issues down the\\nroad. Is this a good trade? Absent
      an ethical framework, it's tough to\\nsay, but *HGP* doesn't even acknowledge
      the question.\\n\\nThere's a deeper truth here, which is that rejecting the
      status quo\\nisn't the same as proposing an alternative. It's not unfair to
      read\\n*HGP* as an account of Doucleff becoming redpilled on parenting and\\nrealizing
      that all her assumptions about how to raise her children might\\nbe wrong---but,
      like many of the newly redpilled, Doucleff lingers too\\nlong in her rebellion
      and doesn't (in *HGP*) articulate a satisfying\\npositive vision for what parenting
      should be. There are innumerable\\ncultures out there, each of which doubtless
      parents in a different way,\\nand choosing what practices to adopt from each
      tradition requires\\nwisdom.\\n\\nBut these aren't choices we should want Doucleff
      to make for us. In the\\nintroduction to *HGP*, Doucleff writes that \\\"as
      we move outside the\\nU.S., we'll start to see the Western approach to parenting
      with fresh\\neyes,\\\" and this seems true. *HGP* prompts us to reflect on the
      choices\\nwe make as parents and the ways in which we might choose differently,\\nand
      even if you disagree with all of Doucleff's advice it's worth\\nreading for
      this experience alone.\\n\\n*Thanks to my wife for recommending this book to

      computing gets a lot of attention these days. In this post, I\nwant to examine
      the application of quantum computing to quantum\nchemistry, with a focus on
      determining whether there are any\nbusiness-viable applications today. My conclusion
      is that while quantum\ncomputing is a very exciting scientific direction for
      chemistry, it''s\nstill very much a realm where basic research and development
      is needed,\nand it''s not yet ready for substantial commercial attention.\n\n*Briefly,
      for those unaware, quantum computing revolves around \"qubits\"\n(Biblical pun
      intended?), quantum analogs of regular bits. They can be\nin the spin-up or
      spin-down states, much like bits can hold a 0 or a 1,\nbut they also exhibit
      quantum behavior like superposition and\nentanglement.*\n\n*Algorithms which
      run on quantum computers can exhibit \"quantum\nadvantage,\" where for a given
      problem the quantum algorithm scales\nbetter than the classical algorithm, or
      \"quantum supremacy,\" where the\nquantum algorithm is able to tackle problems
      inaccessible to classical\ncomputers. Perhaps the best-known example of this
      is [Shor''s\nalgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), which\nenables
      integer factorization in polynomial time (in comparison to the\nfastest classical
      algorithm, which is sub-exponential).*\n\n*It''s pretty tough to actually make
      quantum computers in the real world,\nthough. There are many different strategies
      for what to make qubits out\nof: isolated atoms, nitrogen vacancy centers in
      diamonds,\nsuperconductors, and trapped ions have all been proposed. The limited\nnumber
      of qubits accessible by state-of-the-art quantum computers, along\nwith the
      high error rate and short decoherence times, means that\npractical quantum computation
      is very challenging today. These\nchallenges are collectively described as \"noisy
      intermediate-scale\nquantum\", or [NISQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862),
      the world we\ncurrently live in. Much effort has gone into trying to find\nNISQ-compatible
      algorithms.*\n\nQuantum chemistry, which revolves around simulating a quantum
      system\n(nuclei and electrons), seems like an ideal candidate for quantum\ncomputing.
      And indeed, many people have proposed using quantum computers\nfor quantum chemistry,
      even going so far as to call chemistry the\n\"killer app\" for quantum computation.\n\nHere
      are a few representative claims:\n\n- \"Few fields will get value from quantum
      computing as quickly as\n  chemistry. Even today''s supercomputers struggle
      to model a single\n  molecule in its full complexity. We study algorithms designed
      to do\n  what those machines can''t, and power a new era of discovery in\n  chemistry,
      materials, and medicine.\"\n  ([IBM](https://research.ibm.com/topics/quantum-chemistry))\n\n-
      \"The problem is that most quantum chemical problems scale\n  exponentially
      with system size. And classical computers struggle to\n  cope with this exponential
      scaling. Realistically, they will never\n  enable quantum chemistry to tackle
      real-world systems.\" ([EMD\n  Group](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/research/science-space/envisioning-tomorrow/smarter-connected-world/quantum-computing.html))\n\n-
      \"Classically built computers simply cannot handle the level of\n  complexity
      of substances as commonplace as caffeine... But if future\n  chemists embrace
      quantum computers, they are likely to be a lot\n  luckier.\" ([Scientific\n  American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-quantum-computing-could-remake-chemistry/))\n\nNone
      of these claims are technically incorrect---there *is* a level of\n\"full complexity\"
      to caffeine which we cannot model today---but most of\nthem are very misleading.
      Computational chemistry is doing just fine as\na field without quantum computers;
      I don''t think there are any deep\nscientific questions about the nature of
      caffeine that depend on\ncomputing its exact electronic structure to the microHartree\n([competitions
      between physical chemists\nnotwithstanding](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02621)).\n\n(Some
      other claims about quantum computing and chemistry border on the\nridiculous:
      I''m not sure what to take away from [this D-Wave press\nrelease](https://nam.org/how-quantum-computing-can-combat-forever-chemicals-29001/?stream=policy-legal&s=03)\nwhich
      claims that their quantum computer can model 67 million solutions\nto the problem
      of \"forever chemicals\" in 13 seconds. [Dulwich Quantum\nComputing](https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum),
      on Twitter/X, does an\nexcellent job of cataloging such malfeasances.)\n\nNevertheless,
      there are many legitimate and exciting applications of\nquantum computing to
      chemistry. Perhaps the best-known is the\nvariational quantum eigensolver (VQE),
      developed by Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik\nand co-workers [in 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213).\nThe
      VQE is a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm suitable for the NISQ\nera: it takes
      a Hartree--Fock calculation as the starting point, and\nthen minimizes the energy
      by optimizing the system classically while\nevaluating the energy with a quantum
      computer. (If you want to learn\nmore, there are a number of easy-to-read introductions
      to the VQE:\nhere''s [one](https://joshuagoings.com/2020/08/20/VQE/) from Joshua\nGoings,
      and here''s\n[another](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/) from Pennylane.)\n\nAnother
      approach, more suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computers\nwith large numbers
      of qubits, is quantum phase estimation. Quantum phase\nestimation, explained
      nicely by Pennylane\n[here](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/11/quantum-computing-for-quantum-chemistry-a-brief-perspective/),\nworks
      like this: given a unitary operator and a state, the state is\nprojected into
      an eigenstate and the corresponding eigenvalue is\nreturned. (It''s not just
      projected onto an eigenstate randomly; the\nprobability of returning a given
      eigenstate is proportional to the\noverlap with the input state.) This might
      sound abstract, but the\nground-state energy of a molecule is just the smallest
      eigenvalue of its\nHamiltonian, so this provides a route to get exact ground-state\nenergies,
      assuming we can generate good enough initial states (again,\ntypically a Hartree--Fock
      calculations).\n\nBoth of these methods are pretty exciting, since full configuration\ninteraction
      (the \"correct\" classical way to get the exact ground-state\nenergy) typically
      has an *O*(*N*!) cost, making it prohibitively\nexpensive for anything larger
      than, like, N~2~. Further work has built\non these ideas: I don''t have the
      time or skillset to provide a full\nreview of the field, although I''ll note
      [this\nwork](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030307)\nfrom
      Head-Gordon & friends and [this\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04351-z)
      from Joonho\nLee. ([These](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34)\n[reviews](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003)\nprovide
      an excellent overview of different algorithms; I''ll discuss it\nlater on.)\n\nBased
      on the above description, one might reasonably assume that quantum\ncomputers
      offer some sort of dramatic quantum advantage relative to\ntheir classic congeners.
      [Recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02199)\nfrom Garnet Chan (and many
      coworkers) challenges this assumption,\nthough:\n\n> ...we do not find evidence
      for the exponential scaling of classical\n> heuristics in a set of relevant
      problems. ...our results suggest that\n> without new and fundamental insights,
      there may be a lack of generic\n> EQA \\[exponential quantum advantage\\] in
      this task. Identifying a\n> relevant quantum chemical system with strong evidence
      of EQA remains\n> an open question.\n\nThe authors make many interesting points.
      In particular, they point out\nthat physical systems seem to exhibit locality,
      i.e. if we''re trying to\ndescribe some system embedded in a larger environment
      to a given\naccuracy, then there''s some distance beyond which we can ignore
      the\nlarger environment. This means that there are almost certainly\npolynomial-time
      classical algorithms out there for all of computational\nchemistry, since at
      some point increasing system size won''t slow our\ncomputations down any more.\n\nThis
      might sound abstract, but the authors point out that\ncoupled-cluster theory,
      which can (in principle) be extended to\narbitrary levels of precision, can
      be made to take advantage of locality\nand scale linearly with increasing system
      size or increasing levels of\naccuracy. Although such algorithms aren''t known
      for strongly correlated\nsystems, like metallic systems, Chan and co-workers
      argue based on\nanalogy to strongly correlated model systems that analogous
      behavior can\nbe expected.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcaf90c6-1333-482d-8835-76a33d4a38c0_1430x718.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      agrees\nwith this assessment: the authors write that \"there is currently no\nevidence
      that heuristic NISQ approaches \\[like VQE\\] will be able to\nscale to large
      system sizes and provide advantage over classical\nmethods,\" and conclude with
      this paragraph:\n\n> Solving the electronic structure problem has repeatedly

      computers. Nevertheless, the discussion above highlights a number of\n> challenges

      is that, unlike\n> problems such as factoring, the end-to-end electronic structure\n>
      problem typically requires solving a large number of closely related\n> problem
      instances.\n\nAn important thing to note, which the above paragraph alludes
      to, is\nthat the specific quantum algorithms discussed here don\\''t actually
      make\nquantum chemistry faster than today''s methods---they typically rely on
      a\nHartree--Fock ansatz, which is about the same amount of work as a DFT\ncalculation.
      Since it\\''s likely that proper treatment of electron\ncorrelation will require
      a sizable basis set, much like we see with\ncoupled-cluster theory, we can presume
      that quantum methods would be\nslower than most DFT methods (even assuming that
      the actual quantum part\nof the calculation could be run instantly).\n\nThis
      ignores the fact that the quantum methods would of course give much\nbetter
      results---but an uncomfortable truth is that, unlike one might\nthink from the
      exuberant press releases quoted above, classical\nalgorithms generally do an
      exceptional job already. Most molecules are\nvery simple from an electronic
      structure perspective: static electron\ncorrelation is pretty rare, and linear
      scaling CCSD(T) approaches are\nwidely available and very effective\n([e.g.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00359)).
      There''s\nsimply no need for FCI-quality results for most chemical problems,\n[random
      exceptions\nnotwithstanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08927.pdf).\n\n(Aspuru-Guzik
      and co-workers agree; [in a 2020\nreview](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003),\nthey
      state that they \"do not expect \\[HF and DFT\\] calculations to be\nreplaced
      by those on quantum computers, given the large system sizes\nthat are simulated,\"
      suggesting instead that quantum computers might\nfind utility for statically
      correlated systems with 100+ spin orbitals)\n\nA related point I made in a [recent
      essay/white paper for\nRowan](https://rowansci.substack.com/p/quantum-chemistry-in-drug-discovery)\nis
      that quantum chemistry, at least as it''s applied to drug discovery,\nis limited
      not by accuracy but by speed. Existing quantum chemistry\nmethods are already
      far more accurate than state-of-the-art drug\ndiscovery methods; replacing them
      with quantum computing-based\napproaches is like worrying about whether to bring
      a Lamborghini or a\nFormula 1 car to a go-kart race. It''s almost certain that
      there''s some\nway that \"perfect\" electronic structure calculations could
      be useful in\ndrug design, but it''s hardly trivial to figure out how to turn
      a bunch\nof VQE calculations into a clinical candidate.\n\nOther fields, like
      materials science, seem to be more limited by\ninaccuracies in theory---modeling
      metals and surfaces is really\nhard---but the Hartree--Fock ansatz is also hard
      here, and there are\nfewer commercial precedents for computational chemistry
      in general. To\nmy knowledge, the Hartree--Fock starting point alone is a terrific\nchallenge
      for a system like e.g. a cube of 10,000 metal atoms, which is\nwhy so many materials
      scientists avoid exact exchange and stick to local\nfunctionals. (I don\\''t
      know much about computations on periodic systems,\nthough, so correct me if
      this is wrong!) Using quantum computing to\ndesign superconducting materials
      probably won''t be [as easy as it seems\non Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1684831855411961857).\n\nSo,
      while quantum computing is a terrifically exciting direction for\ncomputational
      chemistry in a scientific sense, I''m not sure it''s yet\ninvestable in a business
      sense. I don''t mean to belittle all the great\nscientific work being done in
      this field, in the papers I''ve referenced\nabove and in many others. The point
      I''m trying to make here---that this\nfield isn''t mature enough for actual
      commercial utility---could just as\neasily be made about ML in the 2000s, or
      any other number of promising\nbut pre-commercial technologies.\n\nI''ll close
      by noting that it seems like markets are coming around to\nthis perspective,

      computing gets a lot of attention these days. In this post, I\\nwant to examine
      the application of quantum computing to quantum\\nchemistry, with a focus on
      determining whether there are any\\nbusiness-viable applications today. My conclusion
      is that while quantum\\ncomputing is a very exciting scientific direction for
      chemistry, it's\\nstill very much a realm where basic research and development
      is needed,\\nand it's not yet ready for substantial commercial attention.\\n\\n*Briefly,
      for those unaware, quantum computing revolves around \\\"qubits\\\"\\n(Biblical
      pun intended?), quantum analogs of regular bits. They can be\\nin the spin-up
      or spin-down states, much like bits can hold a 0 or a 1,\\nbut they also exhibit
      quantum behavior like superposition and\\nentanglement.*\\n\\n*Algorithms which
      run on quantum computers can exhibit \\\"quantum\\nadvantage,\\\" where for
      a given problem the quantum algorithm scales\\nbetter than the classical algorithm,
      or \\\"quantum supremacy,\\\" where the\\nquantum algorithm is able to tackle
      problems inaccessible to classical\\ncomputers. Perhaps the best-known example
      of this is [Shor's\\nalgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm),
      which\\nenables integer factorization in polynomial time (in comparison to the\\nfastest
      classical algorithm, which is sub-exponential).*\\n\\n*It's pretty tough to
      actually make quantum computers in the real world,\\nthough. There are many
      different strategies for what to make qubits out\\nof: isolated atoms, nitrogen
      vacancy centers in diamonds,\\nsuperconductors, and trapped ions have all been
      proposed. The limited\\nnumber of qubits accessible by state-of-the-art quantum
      computers, along\\nwith the high error rate and short decoherence times, means
      that\\npractical quantum computation is very challenging today. These\\nchallenges
      are collectively described as \\\"noisy intermediate-scale\\nquantum\\\", or
      [NISQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862), the world we\\ncurrently live in.
      Much effort has gone into trying to find\\nNISQ-compatible algorithms.*\\n\\nQuantum
      chemistry, which revolves around simulating a quantum system\\n(nuclei and electrons),
      seems like an ideal candidate for quantum\\ncomputing. And indeed, many people
      have proposed using quantum computers\\nfor quantum chemistry, even going so
      far as to call chemistry the\\n\\\"killer app\\\" for quantum computation.\\n\\nHere
      are a few representative claims:\\n\\n- \\\"Few fields will get value from quantum
      computing as quickly as\\n  chemistry. Even today's supercomputers struggle
      to model a single\\n  molecule in its full complexity. We study algorithms designed
      to do\\n  what those machines can't, and power a new era of discovery in\\n
      \ chemistry, materials, and medicine.\\\"\\n  ([IBM](https://research.ibm.com/topics/quantum-chemistry))\\n\\n-
      \\\"The problem is that most quantum chemical problems scale\\n  exponentially
      with system size. And classical computers struggle to\\n  cope with this exponential
      scaling. Realistically, they will never\\n  enable quantum chemistry to tackle
      real-world systems.\\\" ([EMD\\n  Group](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/research/science-space/envisioning-tomorrow/smarter-connected-world/quantum-computing.html))\\n\\n-
      \\\"Classically built computers simply cannot handle the level of\\n  complexity
      of substances as commonplace as caffeine... But if future\\n  chemists embrace
      quantum computers, they are likely to be a lot\\n  luckier.\\\" ([Scientific\\n
      \ American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-quantum-computing-could-remake-chemistry/))\\n\\nNone
      of these claims are technically incorrect---there *is* a level of\\n\\\"full
      complexity\\\" to caffeine which we cannot model today---but most of\\nthem
      are very misleading. Computational chemistry is doing just fine as\\na field
      without quantum computers; I don't think there are any deep\\nscientific questions
      about the nature of caffeine that depend on\\ncomputing its exact electronic
      structure to the microHartree\\n([competitions between physical chemists\\nnotwithstanding](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02621)).\\n\\n(Some
      other claims about quantum computing and chemistry border on the\\nridiculous:
      I'm not sure what to take away from [this D-Wave press\\nrelease](https://nam.org/how-quantum-computing-can-combat-forever-chemicals-29001/?stream=policy-legal&s=03)\\nwhich
      claims that their quantum computer can model 67 million solutions\\nto the problem
      of \\\"forever chemicals\\\" in 13 seconds. [Dulwich Quantum\\nComputing](https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum),
      on Twitter/X, does an\\nexcellent job of cataloging such malfeasances.)\\n\\nNevertheless,
      there are many legitimate and exciting applications of\\nquantum computing to
      chemistry. Perhaps the best-known is the\\nvariational quantum eigensolver (VQE),
      developed by Al\xE1n Aspuru-Guzik\\nand co-workers [in 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213).\\nThe
      VQE is a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm suitable for the NISQ\\nera: it
      takes a Hartree--Fock calculation as the starting point, and\\nthen minimizes
      the energy by optimizing the system classically while\\nevaluating the energy
      with a quantum computer. (If you want to learn\\nmore, there are a number of
      easy-to-read introductions to the VQE:\\nhere's [one](https://joshuagoings.com/2020/08/20/VQE/)
      from Joshua\\nGoings, and here's\\n[another](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/)
      from Pennylane.)\\n\\nAnother approach, more suitable for fault-tolerant quantum
      computers\\nwith large numbers of qubits, is quantum phase estimation. Quantum
      phase\\nestimation, explained nicely by Pennylane\\n[here](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/11/quantum-computing-for-quantum-chemistry-a-brief-perspective/),\\nworks
      like this: given a unitary operator and a state, the state is\\nprojected into
      an eigenstate and the corresponding eigenvalue is\\nreturned. (It's not just
      projected onto an eigenstate randomly; the\\nprobability of returning a given
      eigenstate is proportional to the\\noverlap with the input state.) This might
      sound abstract, but the\\nground-state energy of a molecule is just the smallest
      eigenvalue of its\\nHamiltonian, so this provides a route to get exact ground-state\\nenergies,
      assuming we can generate good enough initial states (again,\\ntypically a Hartree--Fock
      calculations).\\n\\nBoth of these methods are pretty exciting, since full configuration\\ninteraction
      (the \\\"correct\\\" classical way to get the exact ground-state\\nenergy) typically
      has an *O*(*N*!) cost, making it prohibitively\\nexpensive for anything larger
      than, like, N~2~. Further work has built\\non these ideas: I don't have the
      time or skillset to provide a full\\nreview of the field, although I'll note
      [this\\nwork](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030307)\\nfrom
      Head-Gordon & friends and [this\\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04351-z)
      from Joonho\\nLee. ([These](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34)\\n[reviews](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003)\\nprovide
      an excellent overview of different algorithms; I'll discuss it\\nlater on.)\\n\\nBased
      on the above description, one might reasonably assume that quantum\\ncomputers
      offer some sort of dramatic quantum advantage relative to\\ntheir classic congeners.
      [Recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02199)\\nfrom Garnet Chan (and many
      coworkers) challenges this assumption,\\nthough:\\n\\n> ...we do not find evidence
      for the exponential scaling of classical\\n> heuristics in a set of relevant
      problems. ...our results suggest that\\n> without new and fundamental insights,
      there may be a lack of generic\\n> EQA \\\\[exponential quantum advantage\\\\]
      in this task. Identifying a\\n> relevant quantum chemical system with strong
      evidence of EQA remains\\n> an open question.\\n\\nThe authors make many interesting
      points. In particular, they point out\\nthat physical systems seem to exhibit
      locality, i.e. if we're trying to\\ndescribe some system embedded in a larger
      environment to a given\\naccuracy, then there's some distance beyond which we
      can ignore the\\nlarger environment. This means that there are almost certainly\\npolynomial-time
      classical algorithms out there for all of computational\\nchemistry, since at
      some point increasing system size won't slow our\\ncomputations down any more.\\n\\nThis
      might sound abstract, but the authors point out that\\ncoupled-cluster theory,
      which can (in principle) be extended to\\narbitrary levels of precision, can
      be made to take advantage of locality\\nand scale linearly with increasing system
      size or increasing levels of\\naccuracy. Although such algorithms aren't known
      for strongly correlated\\nsystems, like metallic systems, Chan and co-workers

      above paper is making a very specific point---that exponential\\nquantum advantage
      is unlikely---but doesn't address whether weaker\\nversions of quantum advantage
      are likely. Could it still be the case\\nthat quantum algorithms exhibit polynomial
      quantum advantage, e.g.\\nscaling as *O*(*N*) while classical algorithms scale
      as *O*(*N*^2^)?\\n\\n[Another recent\\npaper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2203533119),
      from\\nscientists at Google and QSimulate, addresses this question by looking\\nat
      the electronic structure of various iron complexes derived from\\ncytochrome
      P450. They find that there's some evidence that quantum\\ncomputers (using quantum
      phase estimation) will be able to outcompete\\nthe best classical methods today
      (CCSD(T) and DMRG), but it'll take a\\nreally big quantum computer:\\n\\n> Most
      notably, under realistic hardware configurations we predict that\\n> the largest
      models of CYP can be simulated with under 100 h of quantum\\n> computer time
      using approximately 5 million qubits implementing 7.8 \xD7\\n> 10^9^ Toffoli
      gates using four T factories. A direct runtime\\n> comparison of qubitized phase
      estimation shows a more favorable\\n> scaling than DMRG, in terms of bond dimension,
      and indicates future\\n> devices can potentially outperform classical machines
      when computing\\n> ground-state energies. Extrapolating the observed resource
      estimates\\n> to the full Cpd I system and compiling to the surface code indicate\\n>
      that a direct simulation of the entire system could require 1.5\\n> trillion
      Toffoli gates---an unfeasible number of Toffoli gates to\\n> perform.\\n\\n(A
      Toffoli gate is a three-qubit operator, described nicely\\n[here](https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/QC/QuantumComputing_Gate_Toffoli.html).)\\n\\nGiven

      review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34) agrees\\nwith this assessment:
      the authors write that \\\"there is currently no\\nevidence that heuristic NISQ
      approaches \\\\[like VQE\\\\] will be able to\\nscale to large system sizes
      and provide advantage over classical\\nmethods,\\\" and conclude with this paragraph:\\n\\n>
      Solving the electronic structure problem has repeatedly been\\n> identified
      as one of the most promising applications for quantum\\n> computers. Nevertheless,
      the discussion above highlights a number of\\n> challenges for current quantum
      approaches to become practical. Most\\n> notably, after accounting for the approximations
      typically made (i.e.\\n> incorporating the cost of initial state preparation,
      using nonminimal\\n> basis sets, including repetitions for correctness checking
      and\\n> sampling a range of parameters), a large number of logical qubits and\\n>
      total T/Toffoli gates are required. A major difficulty is that, unlike\\n> problems
      such as factoring, the end-to-end electronic structure\\n> problem typically
      requires solving a large number of closely related\\n> problem instances.\\n\\nAn
      important thing to note, which the above paragraph alludes to, is\\nthat the
      specific quantum algorithms discussed here don\\\\'t actually make\\nquantum
      chemistry faster than today's methods---they typically rely on a\\nHartree--Fock
      ansatz, which is about the same amount of work as a DFT\\ncalculation. Since
      it\\\\'s likely that proper treatment of electron\\ncorrelation will require
      a sizable basis set, much like we see with\\ncoupled-cluster theory, we can
      presume that quantum methods would be\\nslower than most DFT methods (even assuming
      that the actual quantum part\\nof the calculation could be run instantly).\\n\\nThis
      ignores the fact that the quantum methods would of course give much\\nbetter
      results---but an uncomfortable truth is that, unlike one might\\nthink from
      the exuberant press releases quoted above, classical\\nalgorithms generally
      do an exceptional job already. Most molecules are\\nvery simple from an electronic
      structure perspective: static electron\\ncorrelation is pretty rare, and linear
      scaling CCSD(T) approaches are\\nwidely available and very effective\\n([e.g.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00359)).
      There's\\nsimply no need for FCI-quality results for most chemical problems,\\n[random
      exceptions\\nnotwithstanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08927.pdf).\\n\\n(Aspuru-Guzik
      and co-workers agree; [in a 2020\\nreview](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003),\\nthey
      state that they \\\"do not expect \\\\[HF and DFT\\\\] calculations to be\\nreplaced
      by those on quantum computers, given the large system sizes\\nthat are simulated,\\\"
      suggesting instead that quantum computers might\\nfind utility for statically
      correlated systems with 100+ spin orbitals)\\n\\nA related point I made in a
      [recent essay/white paper for\\nRowan](https://rowansci.substack.com/p/quantum-chemistry-in-drug-discovery)\\nis
      that quantum chemistry, at least as it's applied to drug discovery,\\nis limited
      not by accuracy but by speed. Existing quantum chemistry\\nmethods are already
      far more accurate than state-of-the-art drug\\ndiscovery methods; replacing
      them with quantum computing-based\\napproaches is like worrying about whether
      to bring a Lamborghini or a\\nFormula 1 car to a go-kart race. It's almost certain
      that there's some\\nway that \\\"perfect\\\" electronic structure calculations
      could be useful in\\ndrug design, but it's hardly trivial to figure out how
      to turn a bunch\\nof VQE calculations into a clinical candidate.\\n\\nOther
      fields, like materials science, seem to be more limited by\\ninaccuracies in
      theory---modeling metals and surfaces is really\\nhard---but the Hartree--Fock
      ansatz is also hard here, and there are\\nfewer commercial precedents for computational
      chemistry in general. To\\nmy knowledge, the Hartree--Fock starting point alone
      is a terrific\\nchallenge for a system like e.g. a cube of 10,000 metal atoms,
      which is\\nwhy so many materials scientists avoid exact exchange and stick to
      local\\nfunctionals. (I don\\\\'t know much about computations on periodic systems,\\nthough,
      so correct me if this is wrong!) Using quantum computing to\\ndesign superconducting
      materials probably won't be [as easy as it seems\\non Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1684831855411961857).\\n\\nSo,
      while quantum computing is a terrifically exciting direction for\\ncomputational
      chemistry in a scientific sense, I'm not sure it's yet\\ninvestable in a business
      sense. I don't mean to belittle all the great\\nscientific work being done in
      this field, in the papers I've referenced\\nabove and in many others. The point
      I'm trying to make here---that this\\nfield isn't mature enough for actual commercial
      utility---could just as\\neasily be made about ML in the 2000s, or any other
      number of promising\\nbut pre-commercial technologies.\\n\\nI'll close by noting
      that it seems like markets are coming around to\\nthis perspective, too. Zapata

      computing gets a lot of attention these days. In this post, I\\nwant to examine
      the application of quantum computing to quantum\\nchemistry, with a focus on
      determining whether there are any\\nbusiness-viable applications today. My conclusion
      is that while quantum\\ncomputing is a very exciting scientific direction for
      chemistry, it's\\nstill very much a realm where basic research and development
      is needed,\\nand it's not yet ready for substantial commercial attention.\\n\\n*Briefly,
      for those unaware, quantum computing revolves around \\\"qubits\\\"\\n(Biblical
      pun intended?), quantum analogs of regular bits. They can be\\nin the spin-up
      or spin-down states, much like bits can hold a 0 or a 1,\\nbut they also exhibit
      quantum behavior like superposition and\\nentanglement.*\\n\\n*Algorithms which
      run on quantum computers can exhibit \\\"quantum\\nadvantage,\\\" where for
      a given problem the quantum algorithm scales\\nbetter than the classical algorithm,
      or \\\"quantum supremacy,\\\" where the\\nquantum algorithm is able to tackle
      problems inaccessible to classical\\ncomputers. Perhaps the best-known example
      of this is [Shor's\\nalgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm),
      which\\nenables integer factorization in polynomial time (in comparison to the\\nfastest
      classical algorithm, which is sub-exponential).*\\n\\n*It's pretty tough to
      actually make quantum computers in the real world,\\nthough. There are many
      different strategies for what to make qubits out\\nof: isolated atoms, nitrogen
      vacancy centers in diamonds,\\nsuperconductors, and trapped ions have all been
      proposed. The limited\\nnumber of qubits accessible by state-of-the-art quantum
      computers, along\\nwith the high error rate and short decoherence times, means
      that\\npractical quantum computation is very challenging today. These\\nchallenges
      are collectively described as \\\"noisy intermediate-scale\\nquantum\\\", or
      [NISQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862), the world we\\ncurrently live in.
      Much effort has gone into trying to find\\nNISQ-compatible algorithms.*\\n\\nQuantum
      chemistry, which revolves around simulating a quantum system\\n(nuclei and electrons),
      seems like an ideal candidate for quantum\\ncomputing. And indeed, many people
      have proposed using quantum computers\\nfor quantum chemistry, even going so
      far as to call chemistry the\\n\\\"killer app\\\" for quantum computation.\\n\\nHere
      are a few representative claims:\\n\\n- \\\"Few fields will get value from quantum
      computing as quickly as\\n  chemistry. Even today's supercomputers struggle
      to model a single\\n  molecule in its full complexity. We study algorithms designed
      to do\\n  what those machines can't, and power a new era of discovery in\\n
      \ chemistry, materials, and medicine.\\\"\\n  ([IBM](https://research.ibm.com/topics/quantum-chemistry))\\n\\n-
      \\\"The problem is that most quantum chemical problems scale\\n  exponentially
      with system size. And classical computers struggle to\\n  cope with this exponential
      scaling. Realistically, they will never\\n  enable quantum chemistry to tackle
      real-world systems.\\\" ([EMD\\n  Group](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/research/science-space/envisioning-tomorrow/smarter-connected-world/quantum-computing.html))\\n\\n-
      \\\"Classically built computers simply cannot handle the level of\\n  complexity
      of substances as commonplace as caffeine... But if future\\n  chemists embrace
      quantum computers, they are likely to be a lot\\n  luckier.\\\" ([Scientific\\n
      \ American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-quantum-computing-could-remake-chemistry/))\\n\\nNone
      of these claims are technically incorrect---there *is* a level of\\n\\\"full
      complexity\\\" to caffeine which we cannot model today---but most of\\nthem
      are very misleading. Computational chemistry is doing just fine as\\na field
      without quantum computers; I don't think there are any deep\\nscientific questions
      about the nature of caffeine that depend on\\ncomputing its exact electronic
      structure to the microHartree\\n([competitions between physical chemists\\nnotwithstanding](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02621)).\\n\\n(Some
      other claims about quantum computing and chemistry border on the\\nridiculous:
      I'm not sure what to take away from [this D-Wave press\\nrelease](https://nam.org/how-quantum-computing-can-combat-forever-chemicals-29001/?stream=policy-legal&s=03)\\nwhich
      claims that their quantum computer can model 67 million solutions\\nto the problem
      of \\\"forever chemicals\\\" in 13 seconds. [Dulwich Quantum\\nComputing](https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum),
      on Twitter/X, does an\\nexcellent job of cataloging such malfeasances.)\\n\\nNevertheless,
      there are many legitimate and exciting applications of\\nquantum computing to
      chemistry. Perhaps the best-known is the\\nvariational quantum eigensolver (VQE),
      developed by Al\xE1n Aspuru-Guzik\\nand co-workers [in 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213).\\nThe
      VQE is a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm suitable for the NISQ\\nera: it
      takes a Hartree--Fock calculation as the starting point, and\\nthen minimizes
      the energy by optimizing the system classically while\\nevaluating the energy
      with a quantum computer. (If you want to learn\\nmore, there are a number of
      easy-to-read introductions to the VQE:\\nhere's [one](https://joshuagoings.com/2020/08/20/VQE/)
      from Joshua\\nGoings, and here's\\n[another](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/)
      from Pennylane.)\\n\\nAnother approach, more suitable for fault-tolerant quantum
      computers\\nwith large numbers of qubits, is quantum phase estimation. Quantum
      phase\\nestimation, explained nicely by Pennylane\\n[here](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/11/quantum-computing-for-quantum-chemistry-a-brief-perspective/),\\nworks
      like this: given a unitary operator and a state, the state is\\nprojected into
      an eigenstate and the corresponding eigenvalue is\\nreturned. (It's not just
      projected onto an eigenstate randomly; the\\nprobability of returning a given
      eigenstate is proportional to the\\noverlap with the input state.) This might
      sound abstract, but the\\nground-state energy of a molecule is just the smallest
      eigenvalue of its\\nHamiltonian, so this provides a route to get exact ground-state\\nenergies,
      assuming we can generate good enough initial states (again,\\ntypically a Hartree--Fock
      calculations).\\n\\nBoth of these methods are pretty exciting, since full configuration\\ninteraction
      (the \\\"correct\\\" classical way to get the exact ground-state\\nenergy) typically
      has an *O*(*N*!) cost, making it prohibitively\\nexpensive for anything larger
      than, like, N~2~. Further work has built\\non these ideas: I don't have the
      time or skillset to provide a full\\nreview of the field, although I'll note
      [this\\nwork](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030307)\\nfrom
      Head-Gordon & friends and [this\\nwork](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04351-z)
      from Joonho\\nLee. ([These](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03011.pdf#page34)\\n[reviews](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003)\\nprovide
      an excellent overview of different algorithms; I'll discuss it\\nlater on.)\\n\\nBased
      on the above description, one might reasonably assume that quantum\\ncomputers
      offer some sort of dramatic quantum advantage relative to\\ntheir classic congeners.
      [Recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02199)\\nfrom Garnet Chan (and many
      coworkers) challenges this assumption,\\nthough:\\n\\n> ...we do not find evidence
      for the exponential scaling of classical\\n> heuristics in a set of relevant
      problems. ...our results suggest that\\n> without new and fundamental insights,
      there may be a lack of generic\\n> EQA \\\\[exponential quantum advantage\\\\]
      in this task. Identifying a\\n> relevant quantum chemical system with strong
      evidence of EQA remains\\n> an open question.\\n\\nThe authors make many interesting
      points. In particular, they point out\\nthat physical systems seem to exhibit
      locality, i.e. if we're trying to\\ndescribe some system embedded in a larger
      environment to a given\\naccuracy, then there's some distance beyond which we
      can ignore the\\nlarger environment. This means that there are almost certainly\\npolynomial-time
      classical algorithms out there for all of computational\\nchemistry, since at
      some point increasing system size won't slow our\\ncomputations down any more.\\n\\nThis
      might sound abstract, but the authors point out that\\ncoupled-cluster theory,
      which can (in principle) be extended to\\narbitrary levels of precision, can
      be made to take advantage of locality\\nand scale linearly with increasing system
      size or increasing levels of\\naccuracy. Although such algorithms aren't known
      for strongly correlated\\nsystems, like metallic systems, Chan and co-workers
      argue based on\\nanalogy to strongly correlated model systems that analogous
      behavior can\\nbe expected.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcaf90c6-1333-482d-8835-76a33d4a38c0_1430x718.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      using nonminimal\\n> basis sets, including repetitions for correctness checking
      and\\n> sampling a range of parameters), a large number of logical qubits and\\n>
      total T/Toffoli gates are required. A major difficulty is that, unlike\\n> problems
      such as factoring, the end-to-end electronic structure\\n> problem typically
      requires solving a large number of closely related\\n> problem instances.\\n\\nAn
      important thing to note, which the above paragraph alludes to, is\\nthat the
      specific quantum algorithms discussed here don\\\\'t actually make\\nquantum
      chemistry faster than today's methods---they typically rely on a\\nHartree--Fock
      ansatz, which is about the same amount of work as a DFT\\ncalculation. Since
      it\\\\'s likely that proper treatment of electron\\ncorrelation will require
      a sizable basis set, much like we see with\\ncoupled-cluster theory, we can
      presume that quantum methods would be\\nslower than most DFT methods (even assuming
      that the actual quantum part\\nof the calculation could be run instantly).\\n\\nThis
      ignores the fact that the quantum methods would of course give much\\nbetter
      results---but an uncomfortable truth is that, unlike one might\\nthink from
      the exuberant press releases quoted above, classical\\nalgorithms generally
      do an exceptional job already. Most molecules are\\nvery simple from an electronic
      structure perspective: static electron\\ncorrelation is pretty rare, and linear
      scaling CCSD(T) approaches are\\nwidely available and very effective\\n([e.g.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00359)).
      There's\\nsimply no need for FCI-quality results for most chemical problems,\\n[random
      exceptions\\nnotwithstanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08927.pdf).\\n\\n(Aspuru-Guzik
      and co-workers agree; [in a 2020\\nreview](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/RevModPhys.92.015003),\\nthey
      state that they \\\"do not expect \\\\[HF and DFT\\\\] calculations to be\\nreplaced
      by those on quantum computers, given the large system sizes\\nthat are simulated,\\\"
      suggesting instead that quantum computers might\\nfind utility for statically
      correlated systems with 100+ spin orbitals)\\n\\nA related point I made in a
      [recent essay/white paper for\\nRowan](https://rowansci.substack.com/p/quantum-chemistry-in-drug-discovery)\\nis
      that quantum chemistry, at least as it's applied to drug discovery,\\nis limited
      not by accuracy but by speed. Existing quantum chemistry\\nmethods are already
      far more accurate than state-of-the-art drug\\ndiscovery methods; replacing
      them with quantum computing-based\\napproaches is like worrying about whether
      to bring a Lamborghini or a\\nFormula 1 car to a go-kart race. It's almost certain
      that there's some\\nway that \\\"perfect\\\" electronic structure calculations
      could be useful in\\ndrug design, but it's hardly trivial to figure out how
      to turn a bunch\\nof VQE calculations into a clinical candidate.\\n\\nOther
      fields, like materials science, seem to be more limited by\\ninaccuracies in
      theory---modeling metals and surfaces is really\\nhard---but the Hartree--Fock
      ansatz is also hard here, and there are\\nfewer commercial precedents for computational
      chemistry in general. To\\nmy knowledge, the Hartree--Fock starting point alone
      is a terrific\\nchallenge for a system like e.g. a cube of 10,000 metal atoms,
      which is\\nwhy so many materials scientists avoid exact exchange and stick to
      local\\nfunctionals. (I don\\\\'t know much about computations on periodic systems,\\nthough,
      so correct me if this is wrong!) Using quantum computing to\\ndesign superconducting
      materials probably won't be [as easy as it seems\\non Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1684831855411961857).\\n\\nSo,
      while quantum computing is a terrifically exciting direction for\\ncomputational
      chemistry in a scientific sense, I'm not sure it's yet\\ninvestable in a business
      sense. I don't mean to belittle all the great\\nscientific work being done in
      this field, in the papers I've referenced\\nabove and in many others. The point
      I'm trying to make here---that this\\nfield isn't mature enough for actual commercial
      utility---could just as\\neasily be made about ML in the 2000s, or any other
      number of promising\\nbut pre-commercial technologies.\\n\\nI'll close by noting
      that it seems like markets are coming around to\\nthis perspective, too. Zapata

      reactions for organic chemistry, describing five hypothetical\nreactions which
      were particularly desirable for medicinal chemistry. A\nfew recent papers brought
      this back to my mind, so I revisited the list\nwith the aim of seeing what progress
      had been made. (Note that I am\njudging these based solely by memory, and accordingly
      I will certainly\nomit work that I ought to know about---sorry!)\n\n### **Fluorination**\n\n>
      1\\. Fluorination -- Exchanging a specific hydrogen for a fluorine atom\n> in
      molecules with many functional groups. A reaction that installs a\n> difluoromethyl
      group would be nice too.\n\nThis is still hard! To my knowledge, no progress
      has really been made\ntowards this goal in a general sense (although plenty
      of isolated\nfluorination reactions are still reported, many of which are useful).\n\nC--H
      fluorination is particularly challenging because separating C--H\nand C--F compounds
      can be quite difficult. (Fluorine is often considered\na hydrogen bioisostere,
      which is nice from a design perspective but\nannoying from a\n[chromatography](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac403376h)\nperspective.)
      For this reason, I''m more optimistic about methods that go\nthrough separable
      intermediates than the article''s author: \"installing\nanother reactive group...
      and exchanging it for fluorine\" may not be\nparticularly ideal in the Baran
      sense, but my guess is that this\nstrategy will be more fruitful than direct
      C--H fluorination for a long\nwhile yet.\n\n### **Heteroatom Alkylation**\n\n>
      2\\. Heteroatom alkylation -- A reaction that -- selectively --\n> attaches
      an alkyl group onto one heteroatom in rings that have\n> several, such as pyrazoles,
      triazoles and pyridones.\n\nThis problem is still unsolved. Lloyd-Jones published
      some nice work on\n[triazole alkylation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b02786)\na
      few weeks after the ChemistryWorld article came out, but otherwise it\ndoesn''t
      seem like this is a problem that people in academia are thinking\nmuch about.\n\nUnlike
      some of the others, this challenge seems ideally suited to\norganocatalysis,
      so maybe someone else in that subfield will start\nworking on it. (Our work
      on [site-selective\nglycosylation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04958-w)
      might\nbe relevant?)\n\n**EDIT: I missed [extremely relevant\nwork](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202014239)\nfrom
      Stephan Hammer, which uses engineered enzymes to alkylate pyrazoles\nwith haloalkanes
      (and cites the ChemistryWorld article directly).\nSorry!**\n\n### **Csp^3^ Coupling**\n\n>
      3\\. Carbon coupling -- A reaction as robust and versatile as\n> traditional
      cross coupling for stitching together aliphatic carbon\n> atoms -- ideally with
      control of chirality, too. Chemists also want\n> more options for the kinds
      of molecules they can use as coupling\n> precursors.\n\nThere''s been a ton
      of work on Csp^3^ cross coupling since this article\ncame out: MacMillan\n([1](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/Zhe.pdf),\n[2](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/science.abl4322.pdf),\n[3](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/alcohol_acid.pdf),\n[4](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.2c08989.pdf),\n[5](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.3c01488.pdf),\n[6](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.3c05405.pdf))\nand

      have published\na lot of papers, and plenty of other labs are also working here
      (I can''t\nlist everyone, but I''ll highlight [this\nwork](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abo0039?af=R)\nfrom
      Sevov). I doubt this can be considered \"solved\" yet, but certainly\nthings
      are much closer than they were in 2019.\n\n(I haven''t seen much work on enantioselective
      variants, though: [this\n2016 paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13211)
      and paper \\#2\nfrom Baran above are the only ones that comes to mind, although
      I''m sure\nI''m missing something. Still---an opportunity!)\n\n### **Reactions
      of Heterocycles**\n\n> 4\\. Making and modifying heterocycles -- A reaction
      to install\n> functional groups -- from alkyl to halogen -- anywhere on aromatic
      and\n> aliphatic heterocycles, such as pyridine, piperidine or isoxazole.\n>
      Reactions that can make completely new heterocycles from scratch would\n> be
      a bonus.\n\nI''m not a big fan of the way this goal is written---virtually every\nstructure
      in medicinal chemistry has a heterocycle, so \"making and\nmodifying heterocycles\"
      is just too vague. What would a general solution\neven look like?\n\nNevertheless,
      there are plenty of recent papers which address this sort\nof problem. Some
      of my favorites are:\n\n- Aaron Sather''s work making *N*-aryl piperidines\n  ([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b13114),\n  [2](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62853937f053df9a6d208577))\n\n-
      Basically [all of Andy McNally''s\n  work](https://www.mcnallygroup.org/publications-2)\n\n-
      Some nice [reagent\n  design](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c03537)
      from Patrick\n  Fier, which basically improves on the Chichibabin reaction\n\n(One
      of my friends in academia told me that they really disliked the\nSather work
      because it was just classic reactivity used in a\nstraightforward way, i.e.
      not daring enough. What a clear illustration\nof misaligned incentives!)\n\n###
      **Atom Swapping/Skeletal Editing**\n\n> 5\\. Atom swapping -- A reaction that
      can exchange individual atoms\n> selectively, like swapping a carbon for a nitrogen
      atom in a ring.\n> This chemical version of gene editing could revolutionise
      drug\n> discovery, but is probably furthest from realisation.\n\nIronically,
      this goal is probably the one that''s closest to realization\ntoday (or perhaps
      \\#3): [Noah\nBurns](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08464) and [Mark\nLevin](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adj5331)
      have\nboth published papers converting benzene rings directly to pyridines\nrecently.
      More broadly, lots of organic chemists are getting interested\nin \"skeletal
      editing\" (i.e. modifying the skeleton of a molecule, not\nthe periphery), which
      seems like exactly what this goal is describing.\nTo my knowledge, a comprehensive
      review has not yet been published, but\n[this\narticle](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01735-1#ref-CR2)\ngives
      a pretty good overview of the area.\n\nOverall, it''s impressive how much progress
      has been made towards the\ngoals enumerated in the original article, given that
      it''s only been four\nyears (less than the average length of a PhD!). Organic
      methodology is a\nvery exciting field right now: data is easy to acquire, there
      are lots\nof problems to work on, and there seems to be genuine interest from\nadjacent
      fields about the technologies being developed. Still, if the\ntoughest challenges
      in the field''s imagination can be solved in under a\ndecade, it makes you wonder
      what organic methodology will look like in\n20--30 years.\n\nAs methods get
      faster to develop and more and more methods are\npublished, what will happen?
      Will chemists employ an exponentially\ngrowing arsenal of transformations in
      their syntheses, or will the same\nmethods continually be forgotten and rediscovered
      every few decades?\nWill computers be able to sift through centuries of literature
      and build\nthe perfect synthesis---or will the rise of automation mean that
      we have\nto redesign every reaction to be \"dump and stir\"? Or will biocatalysis\njust
      render this entire field obsolete? The exact nature of synthesis''s\neschatology
      remains to be determined.\n", "images": [], "updated_at": 1697830154, "published_at":

      **Fluorination**\\n\\n> 1\\\\. Fluorination -- Exchanging a specific hydrogen
      for a fluorine atom\\n> in molecules with many functional groups. A reaction
      that installs a\\n> difluoromethyl group would be nice too.\\n\\nThis is still
      hard! To my knowledge, no progress has really been made\\ntowards this goal
      in a general sense (although plenty of isolated\\nfluorination reactions are
      still reported, many of which are useful).\\n\\nC--H fluorination is particularly
      challenging because separating C--H\\nand C--F compounds can be quite difficult.
      (Fluorine is often considered\\na hydrogen bioisostere, which is nice from a
      design perspective but\\nannoying from a\\n[chromatography](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac403376h)\\nperspective.)
      For this reason, I'm more optimistic about methods that go\\nthrough separable
      intermediates than the article's author: \\\"installing\\nanother reactive group...
      and exchanging it for fluorine\\\" may not be\\nparticularly ideal in the Baran
      sense, but my guess is that this\\nstrategy will be more fruitful than direct
      C--H fluorination for a long\\nwhile yet.\\n\\n### **Heteroatom Alkylation**\\n\\n>
      2\\\\. Heteroatom alkylation -- A reaction that -- selectively --\\n> attaches
      an alkyl group onto one heteroatom in rings that have\\n> several, such as pyrazoles,
      triazoles and pyridones.\\n\\nThis problem is still unsolved. Lloyd-Jones published
      some nice work on\\n[triazole alkylation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b02786)\\na
      few weeks after the ChemistryWorld article came out, but otherwise it\\ndoesn't
      seem like this is a problem that people in academia are thinking\\nmuch about.\\n\\nUnlike
      some of the others, this challenge seems ideally suited to\\norganocatalysis,
      so maybe someone else in that subfield will start\\nworking on it. (Our work
      on [site-selective\\nglycosylation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04958-w)
      might\\nbe relevant?)\\n\\n**EDIT: I missed [extremely relevant\\nwork](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202014239)\\nfrom
      Stephan Hammer, which uses engineered enzymes to alkylate pyrazoles\\nwith haloalkanes
      (and cites the ChemistryWorld article directly).\\nSorry!**\\n\\n### **Csp^3^

      options for the kinds of molecules they can use as coupling\\n> precursors.\\n\\nThere's
      been a ton of work on Csp^3^ cross coupling since this article\\ncame out: MacMillan\\n([1](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/Zhe.pdf),\\n[2](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/science.abl4322.pdf),\\n[3](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/alcohol_acid.pdf),\\n[4](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.2c08989.pdf),\\n[5](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.3c01488.pdf),\\n[6](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/jacs.3c05405.pdf))\\nand

      Sevov). I doubt this can be considered \\\"solved\\\" yet, but certainly\\nthings
      are much closer than they were in 2019.\\n\\n(I haven't seen much work on enantioselective
      variants, though: [this\\n2016 paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13211)

      of Dale Carnegie and post-rat [etiquette\nguides](https://sympatheticopposition.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-be-ladylike-for-women))*\n\nScientists,
      engineers, and other technical people often make fun of\nnetworking. Until a
      few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking\nwas some dumb activity
      done by business students who didn''t have actual\nwork to do, or something
      exploitative focused on pure self-advancement.\nBut over the past year or so,
      I''ve learned why networking is important,\nand have found a way to network
      that doesn''t make me feel uncomfortable\nor selfish. I want to share my current
      thoughts here, in case they help\nanyone else.\n\nThe first thing to recognize
      is that networking matters because we live\nin a world of relationships. Technical
      people often struggle with this\npoint: to some, relying on relationships feels
      imprecise or even\nnepotistic. But we''re human beings, not stateless automata
      communicating\nvia some protocol, and it''s inevitable (and appropriate) for
      us to form\nrelationships and care about them.\n\nHaving the right relationships
      can make a big difference. We trust\npeople we know much more than we trust
      strangers. It''s weird for someone\nwhom you''ve never met to email you asking
      for a favor, but very normal\nfor a friend or acquaintance to reach out and
      ask for something. And\nmost ambitious projects (academia, startups, etc) are
      limited not by\nmoney but by human capital: there are only so many talented

      the spirit of Dale Carnegie and post-rat [etiquette\\nguides](https://sympatheticopposition.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-be-ladylike-for-women))*\\n\\nScientists,
      engineers, and other technical people often make fun of\\nnetworking. Until
      a few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking\\nwas some dumb activity
      done by business students who didn't have actual\\nwork to do, or something
      exploitative focused on pure self-advancement.\\nBut over the past year or so,
      I've learned why networking is important,\\nand have found a way to network
      that doesn't make me feel uncomfortable\\nor selfish. I want to share my current
      thoughts here, in case they help\\nanyone else.\\n\\nThe first thing to recognize
      is that networking matters because we live\\nin a world of relationships. Technical
      people often struggle with this\\npoint: to some, relying on relationships feels
      imprecise or even\\nnepotistic. But we're human beings, not stateless automata
      communicating\\nvia some protocol, and it's inevitable (and appropriate) for
      us to form\\nrelationships and care about them.\\n\\nHaving the right relationships
      can make a big difference. We trust\\npeople we know much more than we trust
      strangers. It's weird for someone\\nwhom you've never met to email you asking
      for a favor, but very normal\\nfor a friend or acquaintance to reach out and
      ask for something. And\\nmost ambitious projects (academia, startups, etc) are
      limited not by\\nmoney but by human capital: there are only so many talented
      people out\\nthere, and if you can't get access to them, what you're doing will\\nsuffer.
      (On a macro level, this explains why management consulting has\\nbecome so important.)\\n\\nSo
      it's worth intentionally building relationships before you have an\\nimmediate
      need. There are a lot of people,^\\\\[citation needed\\\\]^ so how\\nmight one
      go about this? One obvious strategy might be to build\\nrelationships with people
      you think could be useful to you. But this\\ndoesn't work very well. It's not
      always obvious what will or won't be\\nuseful in the future, and far too easy
      to let status quo bias reign\\nsupreme. (Most graduate students struggle to
      imagine how knowing someone\\nfrom another subfield could ever be useful, let
      alone someone who isn't\\na scientist, which makes it tough when they want to
      do [something\\noutside academia.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24459155))\\n\\nAnother
      downside to this strategy is that you have to partition people\\ninto \\\"useful\\\"
      or \\\"not useful\\\" upon meeting them. This is self-defeating:\\nmost people
      can figure out when you're treating them only as a means to\\nan end, so walking
      around evaluating everyone's utility tends to poison\\nyour interactions. Plus,
      it's a very Machiavellian way to view the\\nworld, and ought to make you feel
      a little gross.\\n\\nInstead, a better strategy is to accept that you won't
      be able to\\npredict *a priori* who will be useful and instead just try and
      meet\\npeople. If the end goal of networking is to find people you'll be able\\nto
      collaborate with in the future, in one capacity or another, then it's\\nimportant
      to find people who share your values and who you get along\\nwith: in other
      words, friends. So, rather than worrying about if it'll\\nbe better to know
      a renewable energy consultant or a paralegal for a\\nmedical device company,
      you can just see who you like spending time with\\nand go from there.\\n\\nIf
      we think of networking as synonymous to making friends, then it also\\nbecomes
      more obvious when and how one should network. Anything\\nexplicitly framed as
      an opportunity for networking is a bad choice:\\nthese events tend to attract
      people who are self-centered, and mostly\\nend up revolving around LinkedIn
      (the Tinder of networking?). Instead,\\nlook for places where you'll find people
      you could be friends with. For\\nme, this ends up mostly being church and church-adjacent
      spaces like\\nBible studies; I'm not sure what the analogous space for non-religious\\npeople
      is.\\n\\nThe strategies I've discussed above are framed in terms of \\\"demand-side\\nnetworking,\\\"
      or how you can find ways to acquire human capital when you\\nhave a demand for

      the spirit of Dale Carnegie and post-rat [etiquette\\nguides](https://sympatheticopposition.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-be-ladylike-for-women))*\\n\\nScientists,
      engineers, and other technical people often make fun of\\nnetworking. Until
      a few years ago, I did this too: I thought networking\\nwas some dumb activity
      done by business students who didn't have actual\\nwork to do, or something
      exploitative focused on pure self-advancement.\\nBut over the past year or so,
      I've learned why networking is important,\\nand have found a way to network
      that doesn't make me feel uncomfortable\\nor selfish. I want to share my current
      thoughts here, in case they help\\nanyone else.\\n\\nThe first thing to recognize
      is that networking matters because we live\\nin a world of relationships. Technical
      people often struggle with this\\npoint: to some, relying on relationships feels
      imprecise or even\\nnepotistic. But we're human beings, not stateless automata
      communicating\\nvia some protocol, and it's inevitable (and appropriate) for
      us to form\\nrelationships and care about them.\\n\\nHaving the right relationships
      can make a big difference. We trust\\npeople we know much more than we trust
      strangers. It's weird for someone\\nwhom you've never met to email you asking
      for a favor, but very normal\\nfor a friend or acquaintance to reach out and
      ask for something. And\\nmost ambitious projects (academia, startups, etc) are
      limited not by\\nmoney but by human capital: there are only so many talented
      people out\\nthere, and if you can't get access to them, what you're doing will\\nsuffer.
      (On a macro level, this explains why management consulting has\\nbecome so important.)\\n\\nSo
      it's worth intentionally building relationships before you have an\\nimmediate
      need. There are a lot of people,^\\\\[citation needed\\\\]^ so how\\nmight one
      go about this? One obvious strategy might be to build\\nrelationships with people
      you think could be useful to you. But this\\ndoesn't work very well. It's not
      always obvious what will or won't be\\nuseful in the future, and far too easy
      to let status quo bias reign\\nsupreme. (Most graduate students struggle to
      imagine how knowing someone\\nfrom another subfield could ever be useful, let
      alone someone who isn't\\na scientist, which makes it tough when they want to
      do [something\\noutside academia.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24459155))\\n\\nAnother
      downside to this strategy is that you have to partition people\\ninto \\\"useful\\\"
      or \\\"not useful\\\" upon meeting them. This is self-defeating:\\nmost people
      can figure out when you're treating them only as a means to\\nan end, so walking
      around evaluating everyone's utility tends to poison\\nyour interactions. Plus,
      it's a very Machiavellian way to view the\\nworld, and ought to make you feel
      a little gross.\\n\\nInstead, a better strategy is to accept that you won't
      be able to\\npredict *a priori* who will be useful and instead just try and
      meet\\npeople. If the end goal of networking is to find people you'll be able\\nto
      collaborate with in the future, in one capacity or another, then it's\\nimportant
      to find people who share your values and who you get along\\nwith: in other
      words, friends. So, rather than worrying about if it'll\\nbe better to know
      a renewable energy consultant or a paralegal for a\\nmedical device company,
      you can just see who you like spending time with\\nand go from there.\\n\\nIf
      we think of networking as synonymous to making friends, then it also\\nbecomes
      more obvious when and how one should network. Anything\\nexplicitly framed as
      an opportunity for networking is a bad choice:\\nthese events tend to attract
      people who are self-centered, and mostly\\nend up revolving around LinkedIn
      (the Tinder of networking?). Instead,\\nlook for places where you'll find people
      you could be friends with. For\\nme, this ends up mostly being church and church-adjacent
      spaces like\\nBible studies; I'm not sure what the analogous space for non-religious\\npeople
      is.\\n\\nThe strategies I've discussed above are framed in terms of \\\"demand-side\\nnetworking,\\\"
      or how you can find ways to acquire human capital when you\\nhave a demand for
      it. But the same considerations apply to \\\"supply-side\\nnetworking,\\\" or
      marketing oneself to potential people. The beauty of\\ntreating networking simply
      as making friends is that you're not\\ncommitting to any particular outcome:
      maybe you'll benefit from it,\\nmaybe the other person will benefit from it,
      or maybe both of you will\\n(or neither). The expected value of building new
      relationships should\\nalways be positive, which means that networking isn't
      a zero-sum game:\\nit's good for all involved.\\n\\nThe conclusion I want to
      leave you with is this: networking, rightly\\nunderstood, just means living
      in a way that recognizes our dependence on\\nother people. To live life as a
      \\\"networker\\\" means putting yourself in\\nplaces where you might make new
      friends, looking for common ground in\\nall your interactions, and trying to
      recognize others' talents and\\nabilities. Networking isn't some Randian pursuit
      focused on extracting\\nvalue from those around us. It should be done with humility,
      accepting\\nthat we need other people to thrive and being open to whatever\\nrelationships
      come our way.\\n\\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen for editing drafts of this post.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"138008381\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      chemistry, like all attempts to simulate reality, is\ndefined by tradeoffs.
      Reality is far too complex to simulate perfectly,\nand so scientists have developed
      a plethora of approximations, each of\nwhich reduces both the cost (i.e. time)
      and the accuracy of the\nsimulation. The responsibility of the practitioner
      is to choose an\nappropriate method for the task at hand, one which best balances
      speed\nand accuracy (or to admit that no suitable combination exists).\n\nThis
      situation can naturally be framed in terms of [Pareto\noptimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency):
      there''s\nsome \"frontier\" of speed/accuracy combinations which are at the
      limit of\nwhat''s possible, and then there are suboptimal combinations which
      are\ninefficient. Here''s a nice plot illustrating exactly that, from Dakota\nFolmsbee

      this figure, the top left corner is the goal---perfect accuracy in no\ntime
      at all---and the bottom right corner is the opposite. The diagonal\nline represents
      the Pareto frontier, and we can see that different\nlevels of theory put you
      at different places along the frontier. *Ab\ninitio* methods (DFT, MP2, coupled
      cluster) are slow but accurate, while\nforce fields are fast but inaccurate,
      and semiempirical methods and ML\nmethods are somewhere in the middle. (It''s
      interesting to observe that\nsome ML methods are quite far from the optimal
      frontier, but I suppose\nthat''s only to be expected from such a new field.)\n\nAn
      important takeaway from this graph is that some regions of the Pareto\nfrontier
      are easier to access than others. Within e.g. DFT, it''s\nrelatively facile
      to tune the accuracy of the method employed, but it''s\nmuch harder to find
      a method intermediate between DFT and semiempirical\nmethods. (For a variety
      of reasons that I''ll write about later, this\nregion of the frontier seems
      particularly interesting to me, so it''s not\njust an intellectual question.)

      defines a composite method? The term hasn''t been precisely defined\nin the
      literature (as far as I''m aware), but the basic idea is to strip\ndown existing
      *ab initio* electronic structure methods as much as\npossible, particularly
      the basis sets, and employ a few additional\ncorrections to fix whatever inaccuracies
      this introduces. Thus,\ncomposite methods still have the essential form of DFT
      or Hartree--Fock,\nbut rely heavily on cancellation of error to give them better
      accuracy\nthan one might expect. (This is in contrast to semiempirical methods\nlike
      *xtb*, which start with a more approximate level of theory and\nlayer on a ton
      of corrections.)\n\nGrimme and coworkers are quick to acknowledge that their
      ideas aren''t\nentirely original. To quote from their first composite paper
      (on HF-3c):\n\n> Several years ago Pople noted that HF/STO-3G optimized geometries
      for\n> small molecules are excellent, better than HF is inherently capable of\n>
      yielding. Similar observations were made by Ko\u0142os already in 1979, who\n>
      obtained good interaction energies for a HF/minimal-basis method\n> together
      with a counterpoise-correction as well as a correction to\n> account for the
      London dispersion energy. It seems that part of this\n> valuable knowledge has
      been forgotten during the recent \"triumphal\n> procession\" of DFT in chemistry.
      The true consequences of these\n> intriguing observations could not be explored
      fully at that time due\n> to missing computational resources but are the main
      topic of this\n> work.\n\nAnd it''s not as though minimal basis sets have been
      forgotten:\n[MIDIX](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01127507) still
      sees\nuse (I used it during my PhD), and Todd Martinez has been exploring\n[these
      ideas](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp307741u) for a while.\nNevertheless,
      composite methods seem to have attracted attention in a\nway that the above
      work hasn''t. I''ll discuss why this might be at the\nend of the post---but
      first, let''s discuss what the composite methods\nactually are.\n\n## **HF-3c
      (2013)**\n\n[HF-3c](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.23317)
      is a\nlightweight Hartree--Fock method, using a minimal basis set derived from\nHuzinaga''s
      MINIS basis set. To ameliorate the issues that Hartree--Fock\nand a tiny basis
      set cause, the authors layer in three corrections: the\nD3 dispersion correction
      (with Becke--Johnson damping), their recent\n[\"gCP\"](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/136/15/154101/941628/A-geometrical-correction-for-the-inter-and-intra?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\ngeometric
      counterpoise correction for basis set incompleteness error,\nand an \"SRB\"
      short-range basis correction for electronegative elements.\n\nHF-3c is surprisingly
      good at geometry optimization and noncovalent\ninteraction energies (MAE of
      0.39 kcal/mol on the S66 benchmark set),\nworks okay for [dipole\nmoments](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10144)
      and\nvibrational frequencies, but seems bad for anything involving bond\nbreaking.
      Thus the authors recommend it for optimization of ground-state\ncomplexes, and
      not so much for finding an entire potential energy\nsurface.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e75366f-5163-45f0-8a38-e9ed08da91f6_1184x1078.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      complaint about all of these papers: the basis set optimization\nisn''t described
      in much detail, and we basically have to take the\nauthors'' word that what
      they came up with is actually the best.)\n\n## **HF-3c(v) (2014)**\n\n[HF-3c(v)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz5021313)
      is pretty much\nthe same as HF-3c, but it uses a \"large-core\" effective core
      potential\nto describe all of the core electrons, making it valence-only. This\nmakes
      it 2--4 times faster, but also seems to make it much worse than\nHF-3c: I''m
      not sure the speed is worth the loss in accuracy.\n\nThe authors only use it
      to explore noncovalent interactions; I''m not\nsure if others have used it since.\n\n##
      **PBEh-3c (2015)**\n\n[PBEh-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/143/5/054107/194086/Consistent-structures-and-interactions-by-density?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\nis
      the next \"3c\" method, and the first composite DFT method. As opposed\nto the
      minimal basis set employed in HF-3c, Grimme et al here elect to\nuse a polarized
      double-zeta basis set, which \"significantly improves the\nenergetic description
      without sacrificing the computational efficiency\ntoo much.\" They settle on
      a variant of def2-SV(P) with an effective core\npotential and a few other modifications,
      which they call \"def-mSVP.\"\n\nAs before, they also add the D3 and gCP corrections
      (both slightly\nmodified), but they leave out the SRB correction. The biggest
      change is\nthat they also reparameterize the PBE functional, which introduces
      an\nadditional four parameters: three in PBE, and one to tune the percentage\nof
      Fock exchange. The authors note that increasing the Fock exchange\nfrom 25%
      to 42% offsets the error introduced by basis set\nincompleteness.\n\nAs before,
      the focus of the evaluation is on geometry optimization, and\nPBEh-3c seems
      to do very well (although not better than HF-3c on e.g.\nS66, which is surprising---the
      authors also don''t compare directly to\nHF-3c in the paper at all). PBEh-3c
      also does pretty well on the broad\nGMTKN30 database, which includes thermochemistry
      and barrier heights,\nfaring just a bit worse than M06-2x/def2-SV(P).\n\n##
      **HSE-3c (2016)**\n\n[HSE-3c](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/CP/C6CP01697A)\nis
      basically the same as PBEh-3c, but now using a screened exchange\nvariant to
      make it more robust and faster for large systems or systems\nwith small band
      gaps. The authors recommend using PBEh-3c for small\nmolecules or large band-gap
      systems, which is my focus here, so I won''t\ndiscuss HSE-3c further.\n\n##
      **B97-3c (2018)**\n\n[B97-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/148/6/064104/196461/B97-3c-A-revised-low-cost-variant-of-the-B97-D?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\nis
      another DFT composite method, but it''s a bit different than PBEh-3c.\nPBE is
      a pretty simple functional with only three tunable parameters,\nwhile B97 is
      significantly more complex with ten tunable parameters.\nCrucially, B97 is a
      pure functional, meaning that no Fock exchange is\ninvolved, which comes with
      benefits and tradeoffs. The authors write:\n\n> The main aim here is to complete
      our hierarchy of \"3c\" methods by\n> approaching the accuracy of large basis
      set DFT with a physically\n> sound and numerically well-behaved approach.\n\nFor
      a basis set, the authors use a modified form of def2-TZVP called\n\"mTZVP\",
      arguing that \"as the basis set is increased to triple-\u03b6\nquality, we can
      profit from a more flexible exchange correlation\nfunctional.\" This time, the
      D3 and SRB corrections are employed, but the\ngCP correction is omitted.\n\nThe
      authors do a bunch of benchmarking: in general, B97-3c seems to be\nsubstantially
      better than either PBEh-3c or HF-3c at every task, which\nisn''t surprising
      given the larger basis set. B97-3c is also often better\nthan e.g. B3LYP-D3
      with a quadruple-zeta basis set, meaning that it can\nprobably be used as a

      **B3LYP-3c (2020)**\n\n[B3LYP-3c](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00877)
      is a\nvariant of PBEh-3c where you just remove the PBEh functional and replace\nit
      with B3LYP (without reparameterizing B3LYP at all). This is done to\nimprove
      the accuracy for vibrational frequencies, since B3LYP performs\nquite well for
      frequencies. I''ve only seen this in one paper, so I''m not\nsure this will
      catch on (although it does seem to work).\n\n## **r^2^ SCAN-3c (2021)**\n\nContinuing
      our journey through the \"Jacob''s ladder\" of composite\nfunctionals, we arrive
      at [r^2^\nSCAN-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/154/6/064103/199831/r2SCAN-3c-A-Swiss-army-knife-composite-electronic?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\nbased
      on the meta-GGA r^2^ SCAN functional. No reparameterization of the\nbase functional
      is performed, but the D4 and gCP corrections are added,\nand yet another basis
      set is developed: mTZVPP, a variant of the mTZVP\nbasis set developed for B97-3c,
      which was already a variant of\ndef2-TZVP.\n\nThe authors describe the performance
      of r^2^ SCAN-3c in rather\nbreathless terms:\n\n> ...we argue that r^2^ SCAN
      is the first mGGA functional that truly\n> climbs up to the third rung of the
      Jacobs ladder without significant\n> side effects (e.g., numerical instabilities
      or an overfitting behavior\n> that leads to a bad performance for the mindless
      benchmark set).  \n>   \n> ...the new and thoroughly tested composite method
      r^2^ SCAN-3c\n> provides benchmark-accuracy for key properties at a fraction
      of the\n> cost of previously required hybrid/QZ approaches and is more robust\n>
      than any other method of comparable cost. This drastically shifts the\n> aforementioned
      balance between the computational efficiency and\n> accuracy, enabling much
      larger and/or more thorough screenings and\n> property calculations. In fact,
      the robustness and broad applicability\n> of r^2^ SCAN-3c caused us to rethink
      the very structure of screening\n> approaches.\n\nThe amount of benchmarking
      performed is a little overwhelming. Here''s a\nnice figure that summarizes r^2^
      SCAN-3c on the GMTKN55 database, and\nalso compares it to B97-3c:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ce3c34-7ff0-4c78-81c7-e1f17a9c036f_882x908.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      **\u03c9B97X-3c (2022)**\n\nFinally, we come to\n[\u03c9B97X-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/158/1/014103/2867476/B97X-3c-A-composite-range-separated-hybrid-DFT?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\na
      composite range-separated hybrid functional derived from Mardirossian\nand Head-Gordon''s\n[\u03c9B97X-V](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/cp/c3cp54374a)\nfunctional
      (which seems to me to be one of the best DFT methods,\nperiod). \u03c9B97X-3c
      reintroduces Fock exchange, so it''s significantly more\nexpensive than r^2^
      SCAN-3c or B97-3c, but with this expense comes\nincreased accuracy.\n\nInterestingly,
      neither of the \"weird\" corrections (gCP or SRB) are\nemployed for \u03c9B97X-3c:
      it''s just an off-the-shelf unmodified functional,\nthe now-standard D4 dispersion
      correction, and a specialized basis set.\nThe authors acknowledge this:\n\n>
      Although \u03c9B97X-3c is designed mostly in the spirit of the other \"3c\"\n>
      methods, the meaning and definition of the applied \"three corrections\"\n>
      have changed over the years. As before, the acronym stands for the\n> dispersion
      correction and for the specially developed AO basis set,\n> but here for the
      compilation of ECPs, which are essential for\n> efficiency, as a third modification.\n\n(But
      weren''t there ECPs before? Doesn''t even HF-3c have ECPs? Aren''t\nECPs just
      part of the basis set? Just admit that this is a \"2c\" method,\nfolks.)\n\nThe
      authors devote a lot of effort to basis-set optimization, because\nrange-separated
      hybrids are so expensive that using a triple-zeta basis\nset like they did for
      B97-3c or r^2^ SCAN-3c would ruin the speed of the\nmethod. This time, they
      do go into more details, and emphasize that the\nbasis set (\"vDZP\") was optimized
      on molecules and not just on single\natoms:\n\n> Molecule-optimized basis sets
      are rarely used in quantum chemistry. We\n> are aware of the MOLOPT sets in
      the CP2K code and the polarization\n> consistent (pc-n) basis sets by Jensen.
      In the latter, only the\n> polarization functions are optimized with respect
      to molecular\n> energies. A significant advantage of molecular basis set optimizations\n>
      is that, contrary to atomic optimizations, all angular momentum\n> functions
      (i.e., polarization functions not occupied in the atomic\n> ground state) can
      be determined consistently, as already noted by\n> VandeVondele and Hutter.\n\nThey
      also put together a new set of effective core potentials, which\nalso helps
      to minimize the number of basis functions. Even so, \u03c9B97X-3c\nis by far
      the slowest of the composite methods, as shown in this figure:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30098e45-af17-4609-9691-2306defc421f_1166x938.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      easy tasks like geometry\noptimization r^2^ SCAN-3c is still probably a better
      choice, but for\nalmost anything else it seems that \u03c9B97X-3c is an excellent
      choice.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747eced3-a623-4f45-9bf0-cb9a65509a3b_1122x990.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      is that \u03c9B97X-3c is not just Pareto-optimal,\nbut close to optimal in an
      absolute sense. I initially framed the goal\nof composite methods as finding
      new ways to increase speed while\ndecreasing accuracy: but here it seems that
      we can gain a ton of speed\nwithout losing much accuracy at all! This should
      be somewhat surprising,\nand the implications will be discussed later.\n\n##
      **Overall Summary**\n\nExcluding some of the more specific composite methods,
      there seem to be\nthree tiers here:\n\n1.  HF-3c, which is very fast but only
      reliable for geometry\n    optimizations and pretty easy property calculations
      (e.g. dipole\n    moment, rough frequencies). But also, geometry optimizations
      are\n    ubiquitous, so this is still very important.\n\n2.  PBEh-3c, B97-3c,
      and r^2^ SCAN-3c, which are all roughly the same\n    speed despite substantial
      differences. Of these, PBEh-3c seems like\n    the slowest and least accurate,
      and I''d be tempted to use either of\n    the others first, especially r^2^
      SCAN-3c. (I''m curious about the\n    tradeoffs that a mGGA functional has versus
      a GGA functional like\n    B97-3c---are there pathological integration grid
      behaviors that\n    B97-3c avoids? See Figure 6\n    [here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/157/17/174114/2842017/Many-recent-density-functionals-are-numerically).)\n\n3.  \u03c9B97X-3c,
      which seems to be in a class of its own, and better than\n    almost everything
      else (not just other composites). That being said,\n    it''s still new, and
      no one loves a method better than its own\n    authors. We''ll have to see some
      real-world tests to make sure things\n    are as promising as they seem.\n\n##
      **Conclusions**\n\nAfter decades of theorists mocking people for using small
      basis sets,\nit''s ironic that intentionally embracing cancellation of error
      is trendy\nagain. I''m glad to see actual theorists turn their attention to
      this\nproblem: people have never stopped using \"inadequate\" basis sets like\n6-31G(d),
      simply because nothing larger is practical for many systems of\ninterest!\n\nThe
      results from this body of work suggest that current basis sets are\nfar from
      optimal, too. The only piece of \u03c9B97X-3c that''s new is the\nbasis set,
      and yet that seems to make a huge difference relative to\nstate-of-the-art.
      What happens if vDZP is used for other methods, like\nB97? The authors suggest
      that it might be generally effective, but more\nwork is needed to study this
      further.\n\nBasis-set optimization seems like a\n[\"schlep\"](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html)
      that people have\navoided because of how annoying it is, or something which
      is practically\nuseful but not very scientifically interesting or publishable.
      Perhaps\nthe success of composite methods will push more people towards studying\nbasis
      sets; I think that would be a good outcome of this research. It\nseems unlikely
      to me that vDZP cannot be optimized further; if the\nresults above are any indication,
      the Pareto frontier of basis sets can\nbe advanced much more.\n\nI''m also curious
      if Grimme and friends would change HF-3c and the other\nearly methods, knowing
      what they know now. Do better basis sets\nalleviate the need for gCP and SRB,
      or is that not possible with a\nminimal basis set? What about D3 versus D4 (which
      wasn''t available at\nthe time)? Hopefully someone finds the time to go back
      and do this,\nbecause to my knowledge HF-3c sees a good amount of use.\n\nPerhaps
      my favorite part of this work, though, is the ways in which\ncomposite methods
      reduce the degrees of freedom available to end users.\n\"Classic\" DFT has a
      ton of tunable parameters (functional, basis set,\ncorrections, solvent models,
      thresholds, and so forth), and people\nfrequently make inefficient or nonsensical
      choices when faced with this\ncomplexity. In contrast, composite methods make
      principled and\nopinionated choices for many of these variables, thus giving
      scientists\na well-defined menu of options.\n\nThis also makes it easier for
      outsiders to understand what''s going on. I\nwrote about this [over a year\nago](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html):\n\n>
      While a seasoned expert can quickly assess the relative merits of\n> BYLP/MIDI!
      and DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVP, to the layperson it''s tough to\n> guess which might
      be superior... The manifold diversity of parameters\n> employed today is a sign
      of \\[computational chemistry\\]''s\n> immaturity---in truly mature fields,
      there''s an accepted right way to\n> do things.\n\nThe simplicity of composite
      methods cuts down on the amount of things\nthat you have to memorize in order
      to understand computational\nchemistry. You only have to remember \"HF-3c is
      fast and sloppy,\" rather\nthan trying to recall how many basis functions pcseg-1
      has or which\nMinnesota functional is good for main-group geometries.\n\nSo,
      I''m really optimistic about this whole area of research, and I''m\nexcited
      that other labs are now working on similar things (I didn''t have\nspace to
      cover everyone''s contributions, but here''s [counterpoise work\nfrom\nHead-Gordon](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/146/23/234105/195242/Effective-empirical-corrections-for-basis-set)\nand
      [atom-centered potentials from\nDiLabio](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01158)).
      The next\nchallenge will be to get these methods into the hands of actual\npractitioners...\n",

      situation can naturally be framed in terms of [Pareto\\noptimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency):
      there's\\nsome \\\"frontier\\\" of speed/accuracy combinations which are at
      the limit of\\nwhat's possible, and then there are suboptimal combinations which
      are\\ninefficient. Here's a nice plot illustrating exactly that, from Dakota\\nFolmsbee

      this figure, the top left corner is the goal---perfect accuracy in no\\ntime
      at all---and the bottom right corner is the opposite. The diagonal\\nline represents
      the Pareto frontier, and we can see that different\\nlevels of theory put you
      at different places along the frontier. *Ab\\ninitio* methods (DFT, MP2, coupled
      cluster) are slow but accurate, while\\nforce fields are fast but inaccurate,
      and semiempirical methods and ML\\nmethods are somewhere in the middle. (It's
      interesting to observe that\\nsome ML methods are quite far from the optimal
      frontier, but I suppose\\nthat's only to be expected from such a new field.)\\n\\nAn
      important takeaway from this graph is that some regions of the Pareto\\nfrontier
      are easier to access than others. Within e.g. DFT, it's\\nrelatively facile
      to tune the accuracy of the method employed, but it's\\nmuch harder to find
      a method intermediate between DFT and semiempirical\\nmethods. (For a variety
      of reasons that I'll write about later, this\\nregion of the frontier seems
      particularly interesting to me, so it's not\\njust an intellectual question.)
      This lacuna is what Stefan Grimme's\\n\\\"composite\\\" methods, the subject

      structure methods as much as\\npossible, particularly the basis sets, and employ
      a few additional\\ncorrections to fix whatever inaccuracies this introduces.
      Thus,\\ncomposite methods still have the essential form of DFT or Hartree--Fock,\\nbut
      rely heavily on cancellation of error to give them better accuracy\\nthan one
      might expect. (This is in contrast to semiempirical methods\\nlike *xtb*, which
      start with a more approximate level of theory and\\nlayer on a ton of corrections.)\\n\\nGrimme
      and coworkers are quick to acknowledge that their ideas aren't\\nentirely original.
      To quote from their first composite paper (on HF-3c):\\n\\n> Several years ago
      Pople noted that HF/STO-3G optimized geometries for\\n> small molecules are
      excellent, better than HF is inherently capable of\\n> yielding. Similar observations
      were made by Ko\u0142os already in 1979, who\\n> obtained good interaction energies
      for a HF/minimal-basis method\\n> together with a counterpoise-correction as
      well as a correction to\\n> account for the London dispersion energy. It seems
      that part of this\\n> valuable knowledge has been forgotten during the recent
      \\\"triumphal\\n> procession\\\" of DFT in chemistry. The true consequences
      of these\\n> intriguing observations could not be explored fully at that time
      due\\n> to missing computational resources but are the main topic of this\\n>
      work.\\n\\nAnd it's not as though minimal basis sets have been forgotten:\\n[MIDIX](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01127507)
      still sees\\nuse (I used it during my PhD), and Todd Martinez has been exploring\\n[these
      ideas](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp307741u) for a while.\\nNevertheless,
      composite methods seem to have attracted attention in a\\nway that the above
      work hasn't. I'll discuss why this might be at the\\nend of the post---but first,
      let's discuss what the composite methods\\nactually are.\\n\\n## **HF-3c (2013)**\\n\\n[HF-3c](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.23317)
      is a\\nlightweight Hartree--Fock method, using a minimal basis set derived from\\nHuzinaga's
      MINIS basis set. To ameliorate the issues that Hartree--Fock\\nand a tiny basis
      set cause, the authors layer in three corrections: the\\nD3 dispersion correction
      (with Becke--Johnson damping), their recent\\n[\\\"gCP\\\"](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/136/15/154101/941628/A-geometrical-correction-for-the-inter-and-intra?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\\ngeometric
      counterpoise correction for basis set incompleteness error,\\nand an \\\"SRB\\\"
      short-range basis correction for electronegative elements.\\n\\nHF-3c is surprisingly
      good at geometry optimization and noncovalent\\ninteraction energies (MAE of
      0.39 kcal/mol on the S66 benchmark set),\\nworks okay for [dipole\\nmoments](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10144)
      and\\nvibrational frequencies, but seems bad for anything involving bond\\nbreaking.
      Thus the authors recommend it for optimization of ground-state\\ncomplexes,
      and not so much for finding an entire potential energy\\nsurface.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e75366f-5163-45f0-8a38-e9ed08da91f6_1184x1078.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      complaint about all of these papers: the basis set optimization\\nisn't described
      in much detail, and we basically have to take the\\nauthors' word that what
      they came up with is actually the best.)\\n\\n## **HF-3c(v) (2014)**\\n\\n[HF-3c(v)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz5021313)
      is pretty much\\nthe same as HF-3c, but it uses a \\\"large-core\\\" effective
      core potential\\nto describe all of the core electrons, making it valence-only.
      This\\nmakes it 2--4 times faster, but also seems to make it much worse than\\nHF-3c:
      I'm not sure the speed is worth the loss in accuracy.\\n\\nThe authors only
      use it to explore noncovalent interactions; I'm not\\nsure if others have used
      it since.\\n\\n## **PBEh-3c (2015)**\\n\\n[PBEh-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/143/5/054107/194086/Consistent-structures-and-interactions-by-density?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\\nis
      the next \\\"3c\\\" method, and the first composite DFT method. As opposed\\nto
      the minimal basis set employed in HF-3c, Grimme et al here elect to\\nuse a
      polarized double-zeta basis set, which \\\"significantly improves the\\nenergetic
      description without sacrificing the computational efficiency\\ntoo much.\\\"
      They settle on a variant of def2-SV(P) with an effective core\\npotential and
      a few other modifications, which they call \\\"def-mSVP.\\\"\\n\\nAs before,
      they also add the D3 and gCP corrections (both slightly\\nmodified), but they
      leave out the SRB correction. The biggest change is\\nthat they also reparameterize
      the PBE functional, which introduces an\\nadditional four parameters: three
      in PBE, and one to tune the percentage\\nof Fock exchange. The authors note
      that increasing the Fock exchange\\nfrom 25% to 42% offsets the error introduced
      by basis set\\nincompleteness.\\n\\nAs before, the focus of the evaluation is
      on geometry optimization, and\\nPBEh-3c seems to do very well (although not
      better than HF-3c on e.g.\\nS66, which is surprising---the authors also don't
      compare directly to\\nHF-3c in the paper at all). PBEh-3c also does pretty well
      on the broad\\nGMTKN30 database, which includes thermochemistry and barrier
      heights,\\nfaring just a bit worse than M06-2x/def2-SV(P).\\n\\n## **HSE-3c
      (2016)**\\n\\n[HSE-3c](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/CP/C6CP01697A)\\nis
      basically the same as PBEh-3c, but now using a screened exchange\\nvariant to
      make it more robust and faster for large systems or systems\\nwith small band
      gaps. The authors recommend using PBEh-3c for small\\nmolecules or large band-gap
      systems, which is my focus here, so I won't\\ndiscuss HSE-3c further.\\n\\n##
      **B97-3c (2018)**\\n\\n[B97-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/148/6/064104/196461/B97-3c-A-revised-low-cost-variant-of-the-B97-D?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\\nis
      another DFT composite method, but it's a bit different than PBEh-3c.\\nPBE is
      a pretty simple functional with only three tunable parameters,\\nwhile B97 is
      significantly more complex with ten tunable parameters.\\nCrucially, B97 is
      a pure functional, meaning that no Fock exchange is\\ninvolved, which comes
      with benefits and tradeoffs. The authors write:\\n\\n> The main aim here is
      to complete our hierarchy of \\\"3c\\\" methods by\\n> approaching the accuracy
      of large basis set DFT with a physically\\n> sound and numerically well-behaved
      approach.\\n\\nFor a basis set, the authors use a modified form of def2-TZVP
      called\\n\\\"mTZVP\\\", arguing that \\\"as the basis set is increased to triple-\u03B6\\nquality,
      we can profit from a more flexible exchange correlation\\nfunctional.\\\" This
      time, the D3 and SRB corrections are employed, but the\\ngCP correction is omitted.\\n\\nThe
      authors do a bunch of benchmarking: in general, B97-3c seems to be\\nsubstantially
      better than either PBEh-3c or HF-3c at every task, which\\nisn't surprising
      given the larger basis set. B97-3c is also often better\\nthan e.g. B3LYP-D3

      **B3LYP-3c (2020)**\\n\\n[B3LYP-3c](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00877)
      is a\\nvariant of PBEh-3c where you just remove the PBEh functional and replace\\nit
      with B3LYP (without reparameterizing B3LYP at all). This is done to\\nimprove
      the accuracy for vibrational frequencies, since B3LYP performs\\nquite well
      for frequencies. I've only seen this in one paper, so I'm not\\nsure this will
      catch on (although it does seem to work).\\n\\n## **r^2^ SCAN-3c (2021)**\\n\\nContinuing
      our journey through the \\\"Jacob's ladder\\\" of composite\\nfunctionals, we
      arrive at [r^2^\\nSCAN-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/154/6/064103/199831/r2SCAN-3c-A-Swiss-army-knife-composite-electronic?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\\nbased
      on the meta-GGA r^2^ SCAN functional. No reparameterization of the\\nbase functional
      is performed, but the D4 and gCP corrections are added,\\nand yet another basis
      set is developed: mTZVPP, a variant of the mTZVP\\nbasis set developed for B97-3c,
      which was already a variant of\\ndef2-TZVP.\\n\\nThe authors describe the performance
      of r^2^ SCAN-3c in rather\\nbreathless terms:\\n\\n> ...we argue that r^2^ SCAN
      is the first mGGA functional that truly\\n> climbs up to the third rung of the
      Jacobs ladder without significant\\n> side effects (e.g., numerical instabilities
      or an overfitting behavior\\n> that leads to a bad performance for the mindless
      benchmark set).  \\n>   \\n> ...the new and thoroughly tested composite method
      r^2^ SCAN-3c\\n> provides benchmark-accuracy for key properties at a fraction
      of the\\n> cost of previously required hybrid/QZ approaches and is more robust\\n>
      than any other method of comparable cost. This drastically shifts the\\n> aforementioned
      balance between the computational efficiency and\\n> accuracy, enabling much
      larger and/or more thorough screenings and\\n> property calculations. In fact,
      the robustness and broad applicability\\n> of r^2^ SCAN-3c caused us to rethink
      the very structure of screening\\n> approaches.\\n\\nThe amount of benchmarking
      performed is a little overwhelming. Here's a\\nnice figure that summarizes r^2^
      SCAN-3c on the GMTKN55 database, and\\nalso compares it to B97-3c:\\n\\n:::

      **\u03C9B97X-3c (2022)**\\n\\nFinally, we come to\\n[\u03C9B97X-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/158/1/014103/2867476/B97X-3c-A-composite-range-separated-hybrid-DFT?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\\na
      composite range-separated hybrid functional derived from Mardirossian\\nand
      Head-Gordon's\\n[\u03C9B97X-V](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/cp/c3cp54374a)\\nfunctional
      (which seems to me to be one of the best DFT methods,\\nperiod). \u03C9B97X-3c
      reintroduces Fock exchange, so it's significantly more\\nexpensive than r^2^
      SCAN-3c or B97-3c, but with this expense comes\\nincreased accuracy.\\n\\nInterestingly,
      neither of the \\\"weird\\\" corrections (gCP or SRB) are\\nemployed for \u03C9B97X-3c:
      it's just an off-the-shelf unmodified functional,\\nthe now-standard D4 dispersion
      correction, and a specialized basis set.\\nThe authors acknowledge this:\\n\\n>
      Although \u03C9B97X-3c is designed mostly in the spirit of the other \\\"3c\\\"\\n>
      methods, the meaning and definition of the applied \\\"three corrections\\\"\\n>
      have changed over the years. As before, the acronym stands for the\\n> dispersion
      correction and for the specially developed AO basis set,\\n> but here for the
      compilation of ECPs, which are essential for\\n> efficiency, as a third modification.\\n\\n(But
      weren't there ECPs before? Doesn't even HF-3c have ECPs? Aren't\\nECPs just
      part of the basis set? Just admit that this is a \\\"2c\\\" method,\\nfolks.)\\n\\nThe
      authors devote a lot of effort to basis-set optimization, because\\nrange-separated
      hybrids are so expensive that using a triple-zeta basis\\nset like they did
      for B97-3c or r^2^ SCAN-3c would ruin the speed of the\\nmethod. This time,
      they do go into more details, and emphasize that the\\nbasis set (\\\"vDZP\\\")
      was optimized on molecules and not just on single\\natoms:\\n\\n> Molecule-optimized
      basis sets are rarely used in quantum chemistry. We\\n> are aware of the MOLOPT
      sets in the CP2K code and the polarization\\n> consistent (pc-n) basis sets
      by Jensen. In the latter, only the\\n> polarization functions are optimized
      with respect to molecular\\n> energies. A significant advantage of molecular
      basis set optimizations\\n> is that, contrary to atomic optimizations, all angular
      momentum\\n> functions (i.e., polarization functions not occupied in the atomic\\n>
      ground state) can be determined consistently, as already noted by\\n> VandeVondele
      and Hutter.\\n\\nThey also put together a new set of effective core potentials,
      which\\nalso helps to minimize the number of basis functions. Even so, \u03C9B97X-3c\\nis
      by far the slowest of the composite methods, as shown in this figure:\\n\\n:::

      observation is that \u03C9B97X-3c is not just Pareto-optimal,\\nbut close to
      optimal in an absolute sense. I initially framed the goal\\nof composite methods
      as finding new ways to increase speed while\\ndecreasing accuracy: but here
      it seems that we can gain a ton of speed\\nwithout losing much accuracy at all!
      This should be somewhat surprising,\\nand the implications will be discussed
      later.\\n\\n## **Overall Summary**\\n\\nExcluding some of the more specific
      composite methods, there seem to be\\nthree tiers here:\\n\\n1.  HF-3c, which
      is very fast but only reliable for geometry\\n    optimizations and pretty easy
      property calculations (e.g. dipole\\n    moment, rough frequencies). But also,
      geometry optimizations are\\n    ubiquitous, so this is still very important.\\n\\n2.
      \ PBEh-3c, B97-3c, and r^2^ SCAN-3c, which are all roughly the same\\n    speed
      despite substantial differences. Of these, PBEh-3c seems like\\n    the slowest
      and least accurate, and I'd be tempted to use either of\\n    the others first,
      especially r^2^ SCAN-3c. (I'm curious about the\\n    tradeoffs that a mGGA
      functional has versus a GGA functional like\\n    B97-3c---are there pathological
      integration grid behaviors that\\n    B97-3c avoids? See Figure 6\\n    [here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/157/17/174114/2842017/Many-recent-density-functionals-are-numerically).)\\n\\n3.
      \ \u03C9B97X-3c, which seems to be in a class of its own, and better than\\n
      \   almost everything else (not just other composites). That being said,\\n
      \   it's still new, and no one loves a method better than its own\\n    authors.
      We'll have to see some real-world tests to make sure things\\n    are as promising
      as they seem.\\n\\n## **Conclusions**\\n\\nAfter decades of theorists mocking
      people for using small basis sets,\\nit's ironic that intentionally embracing
      cancellation of error is trendy\\nagain. I'm glad to see actual theorists turn
      their attention to this\\nproblem: people have never stopped using \\\"inadequate\\\"
      basis sets like\\n6-31G(d), simply because nothing larger is practical for many
      systems of\\ninterest!\\n\\nThe results from this body of work suggest that
      current basis sets are\\nfar from optimal, too. The only piece of \u03C9B97X-3c
      that's new is the\\nbasis set, and yet that seems to make a huge difference
      relative to\\nstate-of-the-art. What happens if vDZP is used for other methods,
      like\\nB97? The authors suggest that it might be generally effective, but more\\nwork
      is needed to study this further.\\n\\nBasis-set optimization seems like a\\n[\\\"schlep\\\"](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html)
      that people have\\navoided because of how annoying it is, or something which
      is practically\\nuseful but not very scientifically interesting or publishable.
      Perhaps\\nthe success of composite methods will push more people towards studying\\nbasis
      sets; I think that would be a good outcome of this research. It\\nseems unlikely
      to me that vDZP cannot be optimized further; if the\\nresults above are any
      indication, the Pareto frontier of basis sets can\\nbe advanced much more.\\n\\nI'm
      also curious if Grimme and friends would change HF-3c and the other\\nearly
      methods, knowing what they know now. Do better basis sets\\nalleviate the need
      for gCP and SRB, or is that not possible with a\\nminimal basis set? What about
      D3 versus D4 (which wasn't available at\\nthe time)? Hopefully someone finds
      the time to go back and do this,\\nbecause to my knowledge HF-3c sees a good
      amount of use.\\n\\nPerhaps my favorite part of this work, though, is the ways
      in which\\ncomposite methods reduce the degrees of freedom available to end
      users.\\n\\\"Classic\\\" DFT has a ton of tunable parameters (functional, basis
      set,\\ncorrections, solvent models, thresholds, and so forth), and people\\nfrequently
      make inefficient or nonsensical choices when faced with this\\ncomplexity. In
      contrast, composite methods make principled and\\nopinionated choices for many
      of these variables, thus giving scientists\\na well-defined menu of options.\\n\\nThis
      also makes it easier for outsiders to understand what's going on. I\\nwrote
      about this [over a year\\nago](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html):\\n\\n>
      While a seasoned expert can quickly assess the relative merits of\\n> BYLP/MIDI!
      and DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVP, to the layperson it's tough to\\n> guess which might
      be superior... The manifold diversity of parameters\\n> employed today is a
      sign of \\\\[computational chemistry\\\\]'s\\n> immaturity---in truly mature
      fields, there's an accepted right way to\\n> do things.\\n\\nThe simplicity
      of composite methods cuts down on the amount of things\\nthat you have to memorize
      in order to understand computational\\nchemistry. You only have to remember
      \\\"HF-3c is fast and sloppy,\\\" rather\\nthan trying to recall how many basis
      functions pcseg-1 has or which\\nMinnesota functional is good for main-group
      geometries.\\n\\nSo, I'm really optimistic about this whole area of research,
      and I'm\\nexcited that other labs are now working on similar things (I didn't
      have\\nspace to cover everyone's contributions, but here's [counterpoise work\\nfrom\\nHead-Gordon](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/146/23/234105/195242/Effective-empirical-corrections-for-basis-set)\\nand
      [atom-centered potentials from\\nDiLabio](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01158)).
      The next\\nchallenge will be to get these methods into the hands of actual\\npractitioners...\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"137303096\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      chemistry, like all attempts to simulate reality, is\\ndefined by tradeoffs.
      Reality is far too complex to simulate perfectly,\\nand so scientists have developed
      a plethora of approximations, each of\\nwhich reduces both the cost (i.e. time)
      and the accuracy of the\\nsimulation. The responsibility of the practitioner
      is to choose an\\nappropriate method for the task at hand, one which best balances
      speed\\nand accuracy (or to admit that no suitable combination exists).\\n\\nThis
      situation can naturally be framed in terms of [Pareto\\noptimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency):
      there's\\nsome \\\"frontier\\\" of speed/accuracy combinations which are at
      the limit of\\nwhat's possible, and then there are suboptimal combinations which
      are\\ninefficient. Here's a nice plot illustrating exactly that, from Dakota\\nFolmsbee
      and Geoff Hutchinson\\n([ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qua.26381)):\\n\\n:::

      this figure, the top left corner is the goal---perfect accuracy in no\\ntime
      at all---and the bottom right corner is the opposite. The diagonal\\nline represents
      the Pareto frontier, and we can see that different\\nlevels of theory put you
      at different places along the frontier. *Ab\\ninitio* methods (DFT, MP2, coupled
      cluster) are slow but accurate, while\\nforce fields are fast but inaccurate,
      and semiempirical methods and ML\\nmethods are somewhere in the middle. (It's
      interesting to observe that\\nsome ML methods are quite far from the optimal
      frontier, but I suppose\\nthat's only to be expected from such a new field.)\\n\\nAn
      important takeaway from this graph is that some regions of the Pareto\\nfrontier
      are easier to access than others. Within e.g. DFT, it's\\nrelatively facile
      to tune the accuracy of the method employed, but it's\\nmuch harder to find
      a method intermediate between DFT and semiempirical\\nmethods. (For a variety
      of reasons that I'll write about later, this\\nregion of the frontier seems
      particularly interesting to me, so it's not\\njust an intellectual question.)
      This lacuna is what Stefan Grimme's\\n\\\"composite\\\" methods, the subject

      structure methods as much as\\npossible, particularly the basis sets, and employ
      a few additional\\ncorrections to fix whatever inaccuracies this introduces.
      Thus,\\ncomposite methods still have the essential form of DFT or Hartree--Fock,\\nbut
      rely heavily on cancellation of error to give them better accuracy\\nthan one
      might expect. (This is in contrast to semiempirical methods\\nlike *xtb*, which
      start with a more approximate level of theory and\\nlayer on a ton of corrections.)\\n\\nGrimme
      and coworkers are quick to acknowledge that their ideas aren't\\nentirely original.
      To quote from their first composite paper (on HF-3c):\\n\\n> Several years ago
      Pople noted that HF/STO-3G optimized geometries for\\n> small molecules are
      excellent, better than HF is inherently capable of\\n> yielding. Similar observations
      were made by Ko\u0142os already in 1979, who\\n> obtained good interaction energies
      for a HF/minimal-basis method\\n> together with a counterpoise-correction as
      well as a correction to\\n> account for the London dispersion energy. It seems
      that part of this\\n> valuable knowledge has been forgotten during the recent
      \\\"triumphal\\n> procession\\\" of DFT in chemistry. The true consequences
      of these\\n> intriguing observations could not be explored fully at that time
      due\\n> to missing computational resources but are the main topic of this\\n>
      work.\\n\\nAnd it's not as though minimal basis sets have been forgotten:\\n[MIDIX](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01127507)
      still sees\\nuse (I used it during my PhD), and Todd Martinez has been exploring\\n[these
      ideas](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp307741u) for a while.\\nNevertheless,
      composite methods seem to have attracted attention in a\\nway that the above
      work hasn't. I'll discuss why this might be at the\\nend of the post---but first,
      let's discuss what the composite methods\\nactually are.\\n\\n## **HF-3c (2013)**\\n\\n[HF-3c](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.23317)
      is a\\nlightweight Hartree--Fock method, using a minimal basis set derived from\\nHuzinaga's
      MINIS basis set. To ameliorate the issues that Hartree--Fock\\nand a tiny basis
      set cause, the authors layer in three corrections: the\\nD3 dispersion correction
      (with Becke--Johnson damping), their recent\\n[\\\"gCP\\\"](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/136/15/154101/941628/A-geometrical-correction-for-the-inter-and-intra?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\\ngeometric
      counterpoise correction for basis set incompleteness error,\\nand an \\\"SRB\\\"
      short-range basis correction for electronegative elements.\\n\\nHF-3c is surprisingly
      good at geometry optimization and noncovalent\\ninteraction energies (MAE of
      0.39 kcal/mol on the S66 benchmark set),\\nworks okay for [dipole\\nmoments](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10144)
      and\\nvibrational frequencies, but seems bad for anything involving bond\\nbreaking.
      Thus the authors recommend it for optimization of ground-state\\ncomplexes,
      and not so much for finding an entire potential energy\\nsurface.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e75366f-5163-45f0-8a38-e9ed08da91f6_1184x1078.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      complaint about all of these papers: the basis set optimization\\nisn't described
      in much detail, and we basically have to take the\\nauthors' word that what
      they came up with is actually the best.)\\n\\n## **HF-3c(v) (2014)**\\n\\n[HF-3c(v)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz5021313)
      is pretty much\\nthe same as HF-3c, but it uses a \\\"large-core\\\" effective
      core potential\\nto describe all of the core electrons, making it valence-only.
      This\\nmakes it 2--4 times faster, but also seems to make it much worse than\\nHF-3c:
      I'm not sure the speed is worth the loss in accuracy.\\n\\nThe authors only
      use it to explore noncovalent interactions; I'm not\\nsure if others have used
      it since.\\n\\n## **PBEh-3c (2015)**\\n\\n[PBEh-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/143/5/054107/194086/Consistent-structures-and-interactions-by-density?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\\nis
      the next \\\"3c\\\" method, and the first composite DFT method. As opposed\\nto
      the minimal basis set employed in HF-3c, Grimme et al here elect to\\nuse a
      polarized double-zeta basis set, which \\\"significantly improves the\\nenergetic
      description without sacrificing the computational efficiency\\ntoo much.\\\"
      They settle on a variant of def2-SV(P) with an effective core\\npotential and
      a few other modifications, which they call \\\"def-mSVP.\\\"\\n\\nAs before,
      they also add the D3 and gCP corrections (both slightly\\nmodified), but they
      leave out the SRB correction. The biggest change is\\nthat they also reparameterize
      the PBE functional, which introduces an\\nadditional four parameters: three
      in PBE, and one to tune the percentage\\nof Fock exchange. The authors note
      that increasing the Fock exchange\\nfrom 25% to 42% offsets the error introduced
      by basis set\\nincompleteness.\\n\\nAs before, the focus of the evaluation is
      on geometry optimization, and\\nPBEh-3c seems to do very well (although not
      better than HF-3c on e.g.\\nS66, which is surprising---the authors also don't
      compare directly to\\nHF-3c in the paper at all). PBEh-3c also does pretty well
      on the broad\\nGMTKN30 database, which includes thermochemistry and barrier
      heights,\\nfaring just a bit worse than M06-2x/def2-SV(P).\\n\\n## **HSE-3c

      gaps. The authors recommend using PBEh-3c for small\\nmolecules or large band-gap
      systems, which is my focus here, so I won't\\ndiscuss HSE-3c further.\\n\\n##

      another DFT composite method, but it's a bit different than PBEh-3c.\\nPBE is
      a pretty simple functional with only three tunable parameters,\\nwhile B97 is
      significantly more complex with ten tunable parameters.\\nCrucially, B97 is
      a pure functional, meaning that no Fock exchange is\\ninvolved, which comes
      with benefits and tradeoffs. The authors write:\\n\\n> The main aim here is
      to complete our hierarchy of \\\"3c\\\" methods by\\n> approaching the accuracy
      of large basis set DFT with a physically\\n> sound and numerically well-behaved
      approach.\\n\\nFor a basis set, the authors use a modified form of def2-TZVP
      called\\n\\\"mTZVP\\\", arguing that \\\"as the basis set is increased to triple-\u03B6\\nquality,
      we can profit from a more flexible exchange correlation\\nfunctional.\\\" This
      time, the D3 and SRB corrections are employed, but the\\ngCP correction is omitted.\\n\\nThe
      authors do a bunch of benchmarking: in general, B97-3c seems to be\\nsubstantially
      better than either PBEh-3c or HF-3c at every task, which\\nisn't surprising
      given the larger basis set. B97-3c is also often better\\nthan e.g. B3LYP-D3
      with a quadruple-zeta basis set, meaning that it can\\nprobably be used as a
      drop-in replacement for most routine tasks.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108aee98-4ac9-4d54-92e4-529cca8e2ee0_1000x874.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      **B3LYP-3c (2020)**\\n\\n[B3LYP-3c](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00877)
      is a\\nvariant of PBEh-3c where you just remove the PBEh functional and replace\\nit
      with B3LYP (without reparameterizing B3LYP at all). This is done to\\nimprove
      the accuracy for vibrational frequencies, since B3LYP performs\\nquite well
      for frequencies. I've only seen this in one paper, so I'm not\\nsure this will
      catch on (although it does seem to work).\\n\\n## **r^2^ SCAN-3c (2021)**\\n\\nContinuing
      our journey through the \\\"Jacob's ladder\\\" of composite\\nfunctionals, we
      arrive at [r^2^\\nSCAN-3c](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/154/6/064103/199831/r2SCAN-3c-A-Swiss-army-knife-composite-electronic?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\\nbased
      on the meta-GGA r^2^ SCAN functional. No reparameterization of the\\nbase functional
      is performed, but the D4 and gCP corrections are added,\\nand yet another basis
      set is developed: mTZVPP, a variant of the mTZVP\\nbasis set developed for B97-3c,
      which was already a variant of\\ndef2-TZVP.\\n\\nThe authors describe the performance
      of r^2^ SCAN-3c in rather\\nbreathless terms:\\n\\n> ...we argue that r^2^ SCAN
      is the first mGGA functional that truly\\n> climbs up to the third rung of the
      Jacobs ladder without significant\\n> side effects (e.g., numerical instabilities
      or an overfitting behavior\\n> that leads to a bad performance for the mindless
      benchmark set).  \\n>   \\n> ...the new and thoroughly tested composite method
      r^2^ SCAN-3c\\n> provides benchmark-accuracy for key properties at a fraction
      of the\\n> cost of previously required hybrid/QZ approaches and is more robust\\n>
      than any other method of comparable cost. This drastically shifts the\\n> aforementioned
      balance between the computational efficiency and\\n> accuracy, enabling much
      larger and/or more thorough screenings and\\n> property calculations. In fact,
      the robustness and broad applicability\\n> of r^2^ SCAN-3c caused us to rethink
      the very structure of screening\\n> approaches.\\n\\nThe amount of benchmarking
      performed is a little overwhelming. Here's a\\nnice figure that summarizes r^2^
      SCAN-3c on the GMTKN55 database, and\\nalso compares it to B97-3c:\\n\\n:::

      Head-Gordon's\\n[\u03C9B97X-V](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/cp/c3cp54374a)\\nfunctional
      (which seems to me to be one of the best DFT methods,\\nperiod). \u03C9B97X-3c
      reintroduces Fock exchange, so it's significantly more\\nexpensive than r^2^
      SCAN-3c or B97-3c, but with this expense comes\\nincreased accuracy.\\n\\nInterestingly,
      neither of the \\\"weird\\\" corrections (gCP or SRB) are\\nemployed for \u03C9B97X-3c:
      it's just an off-the-shelf unmodified functional,\\nthe now-standard D4 dispersion
      correction, and a specialized basis set.\\nThe authors acknowledge this:\\n\\n>
      Although \u03C9B97X-3c is designed mostly in the spirit of the other \\\"3c\\\"\\n>
      methods, the meaning and definition of the applied \\\"three corrections\\\"\\n>
      have changed over the years. As before, the acronym stands for the\\n> dispersion
      correction and for the specially developed AO basis set,\\n> but here for the
      compilation of ECPs, which are essential for\\n> efficiency, as a third modification.\\n\\n(But
      weren't there ECPs before? Doesn't even HF-3c have ECPs? Aren't\\nECPs just
      part of the basis set? Just admit that this is a \\\"2c\\\" method,\\nfolks.)\\n\\nThe
      authors devote a lot of effort to basis-set optimization, because\\nrange-separated
      hybrids are so expensive that using a triple-zeta basis\\nset like they did
      for B97-3c or r^2^ SCAN-3c would ruin the speed of the\\nmethod. This time,
      they do go into more details, and emphasize that the\\nbasis set (\\\"vDZP\\\")
      was optimized on molecules and not just on single\\natoms:\\n\\n> Molecule-optimized
      basis sets are rarely used in quantum chemistry. We\\n> are aware of the MOLOPT
      sets in the CP2K code and the polarization\\n> consistent (pc-n) basis sets
      by Jensen. In the latter, only the\\n> polarization functions are optimized
      with respect to molecular\\n> energies. A significant advantage of molecular
      basis set optimizations\\n> is that, contrary to atomic optimizations, all angular
      momentum\\n> functions (i.e., polarization functions not occupied in the atomic\\n>
      ground state) can be determined consistently, as already noted by\\n> VandeVondele
      and Hutter.\\n\\nThey also put together a new set of effective core potentials,
      which\\nalso helps to minimize the number of basis functions. Even so, \u03C9B97X-3c\\nis
      by far the slowest of the composite methods, as shown in this figure:\\n\\n:::

      lucide-maximize2\\\" />\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nAn interesting
      observation is that \u03C9B97X-3c is not just Pareto-optimal,\\nbut close to
      optimal in an absolute sense. I initially framed the goal\\nof composite methods
      as finding new ways to increase speed while\\ndecreasing accuracy: but here
      it seems that we can gain a ton of speed\\nwithout losing much accuracy at all!
      This should be somewhat surprising,\\nand the implications will be discussed
      later.\\n\\n## **Overall Summary**\\n\\nExcluding some of the more specific
      composite methods, there seem to be\\nthree tiers here:\\n\\n1.  HF-3c, which
      is very fast but only reliable for geometry\\n    optimizations and pretty easy
      property calculations (e.g. dipole\\n    moment, rough frequencies). But also,
      geometry optimizations are\\n    ubiquitous, so this is still very important.\\n\\n2.
      \ PBEh-3c, B97-3c, and r^2^ SCAN-3c, which are all roughly the same\\n    speed
      despite substantial differences. Of these, PBEh-3c seems like\\n    the slowest
      and least accurate, and I'd be tempted to use either of\\n    the others first,
      especially r^2^ SCAN-3c. (I'm curious about the\\n    tradeoffs that a mGGA
      functional has versus a GGA functional like\\n    B97-3c---are there pathological
      integration grid behaviors that\\n    B97-3c avoids? See Figure 6\\n    [here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/157/17/174114/2842017/Many-recent-density-functionals-are-numerically).)\\n\\n3.
      \ \u03C9B97X-3c, which seems to be in a class of its own, and better than\\n
      \   almost everything else (not just other composites). That being said,\\n
      \   it's still new, and no one loves a method better than its own\\n    authors.
      We'll have to see some real-world tests to make sure things\\n    are as promising
      as they seem.\\n\\n## **Conclusions**\\n\\nAfter decades of theorists mocking
      people for using small basis sets,\\nit's ironic that intentionally embracing
      cancellation of error is trendy\\nagain. I'm glad to see actual theorists turn
      their attention to this\\nproblem: people have never stopped using \\\"inadequate\\\"
      basis sets like\\n6-31G(d), simply because nothing larger is practical for many
      systems of\\ninterest!\\n\\nThe results from this body of work suggest that
      current basis sets are\\nfar from optimal, too. The only piece of \u03C9B97X-3c
      that's new is the\\nbasis set, and yet that seems to make a huge difference
      relative to\\nstate-of-the-art. What happens if vDZP is used for other methods,
      like\\nB97? The authors suggest that it might be generally effective, but more\\nwork
      is needed to study this further.\\n\\nBasis-set optimization seems like a\\n[\\\"schlep\\\"](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html)
      that people have\\navoided because of how annoying it is, or something which
      is practically\\nuseful but not very scientifically interesting or publishable.
      Perhaps\\nthe success of composite methods will push more people towards studying\\nbasis
      sets; I think that would be a good outcome of this research. It\\nseems unlikely
      to me that vDZP cannot be optimized further; if the\\nresults above are any
      indication, the Pareto frontier of basis sets can\\nbe advanced much more.\\n\\nI'm
      also curious if Grimme and friends would change HF-3c and the other\\nearly
      methods, knowing what they know now. Do better basis sets\\nalleviate the need
      for gCP and SRB, or is that not possible with a\\nminimal basis set? What about
      D3 versus D4 (which wasn't available at\\nthe time)? Hopefully someone finds
      the time to go back and do this,\\nbecause to my knowledge HF-3c sees a good
      amount of use.\\n\\nPerhaps my favorite part of this work, though, is the ways
      in which\\ncomposite methods reduce the degrees of freedom available to end
      users.\\n\\\"Classic\\\" DFT has a ton of tunable parameters (functional, basis
      set,\\ncorrections, solvent models, thresholds, and so forth), and people\\nfrequently
      make inefficient or nonsensical choices when faced with this\\ncomplexity. In
      contrast, composite methods make principled and\\nopinionated choices for many
      of these variables, thus giving scientists\\na well-defined menu of options.\\n\\nThis
      also makes it easier for outsiders to understand what's going on. I\\nwrote
      about this [over a year\\nago](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html):\\n\\n>
      While a seasoned expert can quickly assess the relative merits of\\n> BYLP/MIDI!
      and DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVP, to the layperson it's tough to\\n> guess which might
      be superior... The manifold diversity of parameters\\n> employed today is a
      sign of \\\\[computational chemistry\\\\]'s\\n> immaturity---in truly mature
      fields, there's an accepted right way to\\n> do things.\\n\\nThe simplicity
      of composite methods cuts down on the amount of things\\nthat you have to memorize
      in order to understand computational\\nchemistry. You only have to remember
      \\\"HF-3c is fast and sloppy,\\\" rather\\nthan trying to recall how many basis
      functions pcseg-1 has or which\\nMinnesota functional is good for main-group
      geometries.\\n\\nSo, I'm really optimistic about this whole area of research,
      and I'm\\nexcited that other labs are now working on similar things (I didn't
      have\\nspace to cover everyone's contributions, but here's [counterpoise work\\nfrom\\nHead-Gordon](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/146/23/234105/195242/Effective-empirical-corrections-for-basis-set)\\nand
      [atom-centered potentials from\\nDiLabio](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01158)).
      The next\\nchallenge will be to get these methods into the hands of actual\\npractitioners...\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"137303096\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      Ari and I announced our new company,\n[Rowan](https://www.rowansci.com/)! We
      wrote an article about what\nwe\\''re hoping to build, which you can read\n[here](https://rowansci.substack.com/p/why-were-building-rowan).
      Also,\nthis blog is now listed on [The Rogue\nScholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/),
      meaning that posts have DOIs and\ncan be easily cited.*\n\nConventional quantum
      chemical computations operate on a collection of\natoms and create a single
      wavefunction for the entire system, with an\nassociated energy and possibly
      other properties. This is great, but\nsometimes we want to understand things
      in more detail. For instance, if\nwe have a host **A** and two guests **B**~good~
      and **B**~bad~, a normal\ncalculation would just tell us that E(**A**\u2022**B**~good~)
      is lower than\nE(**A**\u2022**B**~bad~), without giving any clue as to why.\n\nEnter
      EDA. EDA, or \"energy decomposition analysis,\" is a family of\ntechniques used
      to dissect interactions in a system with multiple\nmolecules. In this case,
      an EDA calculation on the **AB** system would\nbreak down the interaction between
      **A** and **B** into various\ncomponents, which could be used to help scientists
      understand the origin\nof the difference, and perhaps used for continued molecular
      design.\n\nUnfortunately, EDA has always seemed like a pretty troubled technique
      to\nme. Wavefunctions are inherently not localized to individual fragments\nof
      a multimolecular system---you can''t just slice apart the molecular\norbitals
      or the density matrix and end up with anything that''s\nphysically sane. So
      you have to do some computational gymnastics to get\nenergetic terms which are
      at all meaningful. Many such gymnastic\nworkflows have been proposed, leading
      to a veritable alphabet soup of\ndifferent EDA methods.\n\n(It''s worth skimming
      [this\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.26003) on\ndifferent
      EDA methods to get a sense for some of the questions the field\nfaces, and also
      to laugh at how Alston Misquitta & Krzysztof Szalewicz\nuse the review as a
      chance to relentlessly advertise SAPT and denigrate\nany and all competing methods.)\n\nI''ll
      briefly outline how the EDA-NCOV method works for a system **AB**\n(following
      [this\nreview](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wcms.1345)),\nto
      give a sense for the flavor of the field:\n\n1.  Optimized ground-state fragments
      **A**^0^ and **B**^0^ are distorted\n    to the geometries and electronic states
      (**A** & **B**) which they\n    possess in **AB**, and the energy required for
      this\n    distortion/excitation is termed *E*~prep~. (The difference between\n    *E*(**AB**)
      and *E*(**A**) + *E*(**B**) is called *E*~int~, and the\n    total binding energy
      is equal to *E*~int~ + *E*~prep~.)\n\n2.  The distorted fragments **A** and
      **B** are brought together (with\n    frozen charge densities) to form the \"promolecule\"
      **AB**^0^, and\n    the change in energy is termed *E*~elstat~, the quasiclassical\n    Coulomb
      interaction energy (typically attractive). The wavefunction\n    for **AB**^0^
      is \u03a8^A^\u03a8^B^.\n\n3.  The product wavefunction \u03a8^A^\u03a8^B^ is
      antisymmetrized and\n    renormalized to give an \"intermediate state\" \u03a8^0^
      with energy\n    *E*^0^, and the change in energy is termed *E*~Pauli~, originating\n    from
      Pauli repulsion. This component is always repulsive.\n\n4.  \u03a8^0^ is relaxed
      to yield the final wavefunction \u03a8^AB^. The change in\n    energy is termed
      *E*~orb~, because it arises from orbital\n    interactions, and is always attractive.\n\nThus,
      *E*~int~ = *E*~elstat~ + *E*~Pauli~ + *E*~orb~. (Dispersion can\nalso be added
      if an exogenous dispersion correction is employed---that''s\npretty trivial.)\n\nThe
      critical reader might observe that the steps taken to obtain these\nnumbers
      are pretty odd, and that the components of the interaction\nenergy arise from
      differences in energy between bizarre nonphysical\nstates. Thus, the interpretation
      of terms like *E*~elstat~ in terms of\nactual physical interactions might not
      be as easy as it seems. The\nauthors of the above review agree:\n\n> It is important
      to realize that the identification of the three major\n> terms \u0394*E*~elstat~,
      \u0394*E*~Pauli~, and \u0394*E*~orb~ with specific\n> interactions is conceptually
      attractive but must not be taken as\n> genuine expression of the physical forces.\n\nUnfortunately,
      it seems that imprecise concepts familiar to experimental\nchemists like \"steric
      repulsion\" and \"electrostatic attraction\" have to\nbe discarded in favor
      of precise terms like *E*~Pauli~. Too bad they''re\nvirtually uninterpretable!\n\nAnd
      what''s worse is that different EDA-type schemes don''t even give the\nsame
      results. [A paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c08196)\nout today
      in *JACS* from Zare/Shaik discusses the use of EDA and related\nschemes in studying
      the origin of the hydrogen bond (a pretty\nfundamental question), motivated
      by the substantial disagreement between\nvarious techniques:\n\n> It is important
      to realize that different methods (e.g., BOVB,\n> ALMO-EDA, NEDA, and BLW) do
      not fully agree with one another about\n> whether the dominant stabilizing term
      is \u0394*E*~POL~ or \u0394*E*~CT~ in a\n> particular HB.\n\nWhile the authors
      make a good case that the sum of these two terms is\nrelatively conserved across
      methods, and that it''s this term that we\nshould care about for hydrogen bonds,
      the conclusions for EDA broadly\nare not encouraging. (Note, too, that *E*~POL~
      and *E*~CT~ don''t even\nappear in the EDA-NCOV method summarized above---another

      from the AI discourse</a>.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nAnd even if
      the theorists eventually put their heads together and\ndevelop a version of
      EDA that doesn''t have these pitfalls, it''s still\nnot clear that any form
      of EDA will give the answers that experimental\nchemists are looking for. Chemistry
      is complicated, and ground- or\ntransition-state structures arise from a delicate
      equilibrium between\nopposing factors: steric repulsion, electrostatic attraction,
      bond\ndistances, torsional strain, dispersion, &c.\n\nAs a result, one can see
      large changes in the contribution of individual\nfactors even while the overall
      structure''s stability is minimally\nperturbed ([enthalpy--entropy\ncompensation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/md/c4md00057a)\nis
      a classic example, as is Fig. 2 in [this\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201701486)\non
      distortion--interaction analysis). Looking only at changes in\nindividual factors
      isn''t always a useful way to gain insight from\ncomputation.\n\nFor example,
      imagine a nucleophile adding to two faces of an\noxocarbenium, a bulky face
      and an unhindered face. Based on this\ndescription, we might expect to see that
      TS~bulky~ has higher steric\nrepulsion than TS~unhindered~ (if we''re lucky
      enough to find a way to\nextract *E*~steric~ out of our EDA method). But it''s
      also likely that\nthe nucleophile might take a less favorable trajectory towards
      the\noxocarbenium in TS~bulky~ to avoid steric repulsion, thus weakening key\norbital
      interactions. These changes might even end up being larger in\nmagnitude than
      the destabilization induced by steric repulsion. Is the\ncorrect answer, then,
      that TS~bulky~ is higher in energy because of\ndecreased *E*~orb~, not increased
      *E*~steric~?\n\nThe solution is to recognize that causation is not unique (cf.\n[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)),
      and so there''s\nno one right answer here. Within the constraints of the EDA
      framework,\nthe theorist wouldn''t be incorrect in saying that *E*~orb~ is the\ndriving
      factor---but the experimental chemist might reasonably expect\n\"the bulky TS
      is destabilized by steric repulsion\" as their answer,\nsince this is the root
      cause of the changes between the two structures.\n(I side with the experimentalists
      here.)\n\nAnd the precisely defined concepts favored by theorists are often
      hard\nfor experimental scientists to work with. Even if the correct answer in\nthe
      above scenario were \"*TS*~bulky~ is destabilized by decreased\norbital overlap\"---what''s
      an experimentalist supposed to do with this\ninformation, add more orbitals?
      (This is how I feel about Trevor\nHamlin''s work on Pauli repulsion.) The steric
      explanation at least\nsuggests an intuitive solution (make the bulky group or
      the nucleophile\nsmaller). If the purpose of EDA is to help people to understand\nintermolecular
      interactions better on a conceptual level, I''m not sure\nit''s succeeding in
      most cases.\n\n(The only use of EDA that led to an actual experimental advance
      which\nI''m aware of is Buchwald/Peng Liu''s body of work on ligand--substrate\ndispersion
      in hydrocupration:\n[study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07373),
      [new\nligand](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b09565), [ligand from\nHartwig](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c08746).
      I don''t think\nit''s a coincidence that these papers focus on dispersion, one
      of the\neasiest pieces of EDA to decouple and understand.)\n\nI don''t mean
      to be too critical here. The ability to break\nintermolecular interactions down
      into different components is certainly\nuseful, and it seems likely that some
      version of EDA will eventually\nachieve consensus and emerge as a useful tool.
      But I think the utility\nof EDA even in the best case is pretty limited. Quantum
      chemistry is\ncomplicated, and if we think we can break it down into easy-to-digest\ncomponents
      and eliminate the full nonlocal majesty of the Schrodinger\nequation, we''re
      lying to ourselves (or our experimental collaborators).\nCompute with caution!\n",

      Also,\\nthis blog is now listed on [The Rogue\\nScholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/),
      meaning that posts have DOIs and\\ncan be easily cited.*\\n\\nConventional quantum
      chemical computations operate on a collection of\\natoms and create a single
      wavefunction for the entire system, with an\\nassociated energy and possibly
      other properties. This is great, but\\nsometimes we want to understand things
      in more detail. For instance, if\\nwe have a host **A** and two guests **B**~good~
      and **B**~bad~, a normal\\ncalculation would just tell us that E(**A**\u2022**B**~good~)
      is lower than\\nE(**A**\u2022**B**~bad~), without giving any clue as to why.\\n\\nEnter
      EDA. EDA, or \\\"energy decomposition analysis,\\\" is a family of\\ntechniques
      used to dissect interactions in a system with multiple\\nmolecules. In this
      case, an EDA calculation on the **AB** system would\\nbreak down the interaction
      between **A** and **B** into various\\ncomponents, which could be used to help
      scientists understand the origin\\nof the difference, and perhaps used for continued
      molecular design.\\n\\nUnfortunately, EDA has always seemed like a pretty troubled
      technique to\\nme. Wavefunctions are inherently not localized to individual
      fragments\\nof a multimolecular system---you can't just slice apart the molecular\\norbitals
      or the density matrix and end up with anything that's\\nphysically sane. So
      you have to do some computational gymnastics to get\\nenergetic terms which
      are at all meaningful. Many such gymnastic\\nworkflows have been proposed, leading
      to a veritable alphabet soup of\\ndifferent EDA methods.\\n\\n(It's worth skimming
      [this\\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.26003) on\\ndifferent
      EDA methods to get a sense for some of the questions the field\\nfaces, and
      also to laugh at how Alston Misquitta & Krzysztof Szalewicz\\nuse the review
      as a chance to relentlessly advertise SAPT and denigrate\\nany and all competing
      methods.)\\n\\nI'll briefly outline how the EDA-NCOV method works for a system
      **AB**\\n(following [this\\nreview](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wcms.1345)),\\nto
      give a sense for the flavor of the field:\\n\\n1.  Optimized ground-state fragments
      **A**^0^ and **B**^0^ are distorted\\n    to the geometries and electronic states
      (**A** & **B**) which they\\n    possess in **AB**, and the energy required
      for this\\n    distortion/excitation is termed *E*~prep~. (The difference between\\n
      \   *E*(**AB**) and *E*(**A**) + *E*(**B**) is called *E*~int~, and the\\n    total
      binding energy is equal to *E*~int~ + *E*~prep~.)\\n\\n2.  The distorted fragments
      **A** and **B** are brought together (with\\n    frozen charge densities) to
      form the \\\"promolecule\\\" **AB**^0^, and\\n    the change in energy is termed
      *E*~elstat~, the quasiclassical\\n    Coulomb interaction energy (typically
      attractive). The wavefunction\\n    for **AB**^0^ is \u03A8^A^\u03A8^B^.\\n\\n3.
      \ The product wavefunction \u03A8^A^\u03A8^B^ is antisymmetrized and\\n    renormalized
      to give an \\\"intermediate state\\\" \u03A8^0^ with energy\\n    *E*^0^, and
      the change in energy is termed *E*~Pauli~, originating\\n    from Pauli repulsion.
      This component is always repulsive.\\n\\n4.  \u03A8^0^ is relaxed to yield the
      final wavefunction \u03A8^AB^. The change in\\n    energy is termed *E*~orb~,
      because it arises from orbital\\n    interactions, and is always attractive.\\n\\nThus,
      *E*~int~ = *E*~elstat~ + *E*~Pauli~ + *E*~orb~. (Dispersion can\\nalso be added
      if an exogenous dispersion correction is employed---that's\\npretty trivial.)\\n\\nThe
      critical reader might observe that the steps taken to obtain these\\nnumbers
      are pretty odd, and that the components of the interaction\\nenergy arise from
      differences in energy between bizarre nonphysical\\nstates. Thus, the interpretation
      of terms like *E*~elstat~ in terms of\\nactual physical interactions might not
      be as easy as it seems. The\\nauthors of the above review agree:\\n\\n> It is
      important to realize that the identification of the three major\\n> terms \u0394*E*~elstat~,
      \u0394*E*~Pauli~, and \u0394*E*~orb~ with specific\\n> interactions is conceptually
      attractive but must not be taken as\\n> genuine expression of the physical forces.\\n\\nUnfortunately,
      it seems that imprecise concepts familiar to experimental\\nchemists like \\\"steric
      repulsion\\\" and \\\"electrostatic attraction\\\" have to\\nbe discarded in
      favor of precise terms like *E*~Pauli~. Too bad they're\\nvirtually uninterpretable!\\n\\nAnd
      what's worse is that different EDA-type schemes don't even give the\\nsame results.
      [A paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c08196)\\nout today in *JACS*
      from Zare/Shaik discusses the use of EDA and related\\nschemes in studying the
      origin of the hydrogen bond (a pretty\\nfundamental question), motivated by
      the substantial disagreement between\\nvarious techniques:\\n\\n> It is important
      to realize that different methods (e.g., BOVB,\\n> ALMO-EDA, NEDA, and BLW)
      do not fully agree with one another about\\n> whether the dominant stabilizing
      term is \u0394*E*~POL~ or \u0394*E*~CT~ in a\\n> particular HB.\\n\\nWhile the
      authors make a good case that the sum of these two terms is\\nrelatively conserved
      across methods, and that it's this term that we\\nshould care about for hydrogen

      from the AI discourse</a>.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nAnd even
      if the theorists eventually put their heads together and\\ndevelop a version
      of EDA that doesn't have these pitfalls, it's still\\nnot clear that any form
      of EDA will give the answers that experimental\\nchemists are looking for. Chemistry
      is complicated, and ground- or\\ntransition-state structures arise from a delicate
      equilibrium between\\nopposing factors: steric repulsion, electrostatic attraction,
      bond\\ndistances, torsional strain, dispersion, &c.\\n\\nAs a result, one can
      see large changes in the contribution of individual\\nfactors even while the
      overall structure's stability is minimally\\nperturbed ([enthalpy--entropy\\ncompensation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/md/c4md00057a)\\nis
      a classic example, as is Fig. 2 in [this\\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201701486)\\non
      distortion--interaction analysis). Looking only at changes in\\nindividual factors
      isn't always a useful way to gain insight from\\ncomputation.\\n\\nFor example,
      imagine a nucleophile adding to two faces of an\\noxocarbenium, a bulky face
      and an unhindered face. Based on this\\ndescription, we might expect to see
      that TS~bulky~ has higher steric\\nrepulsion than TS~unhindered~ (if we're lucky
      enough to find a way to\\nextract *E*~steric~ out of our EDA method). But it's
      also likely that\\nthe nucleophile might take a less favorable trajectory towards
      the\\noxocarbenium in TS~bulky~ to avoid steric repulsion, thus weakening key\\norbital
      interactions. These changes might even end up being larger in\\nmagnitude than
      the destabilization induced by steric repulsion. Is the\\ncorrect answer, then,
      that TS~bulky~ is higher in energy because of\\ndecreased *E*~orb~, not increased
      *E*~steric~?\\n\\nThe solution is to recognize that causation is not unique
      (cf.\\n[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)), and so there's\\nno
      one right answer here. Within the constraints of the EDA framework,\\nthe theorist
      wouldn't be incorrect in saying that *E*~orb~ is the\\ndriving factor---but
      the experimental chemist might reasonably expect\\n\\\"the bulky TS is destabilized
      by steric repulsion\\\" as their answer,\\nsince this is the root cause of the
      changes between the two structures.\\n(I side with the experimentalists here.)\\n\\nAnd
      the precisely defined concepts favored by theorists are often hard\\nfor experimental
      scientists to work with. Even if the correct answer in\\nthe above scenario
      were \\\"*TS*~bulky~ is destabilized by decreased\\norbital overlap\\\"---what's
      an experimentalist supposed to do with this\\ninformation, add more orbitals?
      (This is how I feel about Trevor\\nHamlin's work on Pauli repulsion.) The steric
      explanation at least\\nsuggests an intuitive solution (make the bulky group
      or the nucleophile\\nsmaller). If the purpose of EDA is to help people to understand\\nintermolecular
      interactions better on a conceptual level, I'm not sure\\nit's succeeding in
      most cases.\\n\\n(The only use of EDA that led to an actual experimental advance
      which\\nI'm aware of is Buchwald/Peng Liu's body of work on ligand--substrate\\ndispersion
      in hydrocupration:\\n[study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07373),
      [new\\nligand](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b09565), [ligand from\\nHartwig](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c08746).
      I don't think\\nit's a coincidence that these papers focus on dispersion, one
      of the\\neasiest pieces of EDA to decouple and understand.)\\n\\nI don't mean
      to be too critical here. The ability to break\\nintermolecular interactions
      down into different components is certainly\\nuseful, and it seems likely that
      some version of EDA will eventually\\nachieve consensus and emerge as a useful
      tool. But I think the utility\\nof EDA even in the best case is pretty limited.
      Quantum chemistry is\\ncomplicated, and if we think we can break it down into
      easy-to-digest\\ncomponents and eliminate the full nonlocal majesty of the Schrodinger\\nequation,
      we're lying to ourselves (or our experimental collaborators).\\nCompute with
      caution!\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"136721543\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      EDA. EDA, or \\\"energy decomposition analysis,\\\" is a family of\\ntechniques
      used to dissect interactions in a system with multiple\\nmolecules. In this
      case, an EDA calculation on the **AB** system would\\nbreak down the interaction
      between **A** and **B** into various\\ncomponents, which could be used to help
      scientists understand the origin\\nof the difference, and perhaps used for continued
      molecular design.\\n\\nUnfortunately, EDA has always seemed like a pretty troubled
      technique to\\nme. Wavefunctions are inherently not localized to individual
      fragments\\nof a multimolecular system---you can't just slice apart the molecular\\norbitals
      or the density matrix and end up with anything that's\\nphysically sane. So
      you have to do some computational gymnastics to get\\nenergetic terms which
      are at all meaningful. Many such gymnastic\\nworkflows have been proposed, leading
      to a veritable alphabet soup of\\ndifferent EDA methods.\\n\\n(It's worth skimming
      [this\\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.26003) on\\ndifferent
      EDA methods to get a sense for some of the questions the field\\nfaces, and
      also to laugh at how Alston Misquitta & Krzysztof Szalewicz\\nuse the review
      as a chance to relentlessly advertise SAPT and denigrate\\nany and all competing
      methods.)\\n\\nI'll briefly outline how the EDA-NCOV method works for a system
      **AB**\\n(following [this\\nreview](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wcms.1345)),\\nto
      give a sense for the flavor of the field:\\n\\n1.  Optimized ground-state fragments
      **A**^0^ and **B**^0^ are distorted\\n    to the geometries and electronic states
      (**A** & **B**) which they\\n    possess in **AB**, and the energy required
      for this\\n    distortion/excitation is termed *E*~prep~. (The difference between\\n
      \   *E*(**AB**) and *E*(**A**) + *E*(**B**) is called *E*~int~, and the\\n    total
      binding energy is equal to *E*~int~ + *E*~prep~.)\\n\\n2.  The distorted fragments
      **A** and **B** are brought together (with\\n    frozen charge densities) to
      form the \\\"promolecule\\\" **AB**^0^, and\\n    the change in energy is termed
      *E*~elstat~, the quasiclassical\\n    Coulomb interaction energy (typically
      attractive). The wavefunction\\n    for **AB**^0^ is \u03A8^A^\u03A8^B^.\\n\\n3.
      \ The product wavefunction \u03A8^A^\u03A8^B^ is antisymmetrized and\\n    renormalized
      to give an \\\"intermediate state\\\" \u03A8^0^ with energy\\n    *E*^0^, and
      the change in energy is termed *E*~Pauli~, originating\\n    from Pauli repulsion.
      This component is always repulsive.\\n\\n4.  \u03A8^0^ is relaxed to yield the
      final wavefunction \u03A8^AB^. The change in\\n    energy is termed *E*~orb~,
      because it arises from orbital\\n    interactions, and is always attractive.\\n\\nThus,
      *E*~int~ = *E*~elstat~ + *E*~Pauli~ + *E*~orb~. (Dispersion can\\nalso be added
      if an exogenous dispersion correction is employed---that's\\npretty trivial.)\\n\\nThe
      critical reader might observe that the steps taken to obtain these\\nnumbers
      are pretty odd, and that the components of the interaction\\nenergy arise from
      differences in energy between bizarre nonphysical\\nstates. Thus, the interpretation
      of terms like *E*~elstat~ in terms of\\nactual physical interactions might not
      be as easy as it seems. The\\nauthors of the above review agree:\\n\\n> It is
      important to realize that the identification of the three major\\n> terms \u0394*E*~elstat~,
      \u0394*E*~Pauli~, and \u0394*E*~orb~ with specific\\n> interactions is conceptually
      attractive but must not be taken as\\n> genuine expression of the physical forces.\\n\\nUnfortunately,
      it seems that imprecise concepts familiar to experimental\\nchemists like \\\"steric
      repulsion\\\" and \\\"electrostatic attraction\\\" have to\\nbe discarded in
      favor of precise terms like *E*~Pauli~. Too bad they're\\nvirtually uninterpretable!\\n\\nAnd
      what's worse is that different EDA-type schemes don't even give the\\nsame results.
      [A paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c08196)\\nout today in *JACS*
      from Zare/Shaik discusses the use of EDA and related\\nschemes in studying the
      origin of the hydrogen bond (a pretty\\nfundamental question), motivated by
      the substantial disagreement between\\nvarious techniques:\\n\\n> It is important
      to realize that different methods (e.g., BOVB,\\n> ALMO-EDA, NEDA, and BLW)
      do not fully agree with one another about\\n> whether the dominant stabilizing
      term is \u0394*E*~POL~ or \u0394*E*~CT~ in a\\n> particular HB.\\n\\nWhile the
      authors make a good case that the sum of these two terms is\\nrelatively conserved
      across methods, and that it's this term that we\\nshould care about for hydrogen
      bonds, the conclusions for EDA broadly\\nare not encouraging. (Note, too, that
      *E*~POL~ and *E*~CT~ don't even\\nappear in the EDA-NCOV method summarized above---another
      reason that EDA\\nis a frustrating field!)\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf3daf3c-1ab5-42a7-95be-7de00b352335_1762x946.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      if the theorists eventually put their heads together and\\ndevelop a version
      of EDA that doesn't have these pitfalls, it's still\\nnot clear that any form
      of EDA will give the answers that experimental\\nchemists are looking for. Chemistry
      is complicated, and ground- or\\ntransition-state structures arise from a delicate
      equilibrium between\\nopposing factors: steric repulsion, electrostatic attraction,
      bond\\ndistances, torsional strain, dispersion, &c.\\n\\nAs a result, one can
      see large changes in the contribution of individual\\nfactors even while the
      overall structure's stability is minimally\\nperturbed ([enthalpy--entropy\\ncompensation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/md/c4md00057a)\\nis
      a classic example, as is Fig. 2 in [this\\nreview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201701486)\\non
      distortion--interaction analysis). Looking only at changes in\\nindividual factors
      isn't always a useful way to gain insight from\\ncomputation.\\n\\nFor example,
      imagine a nucleophile adding to two faces of an\\noxocarbenium, a bulky face
      and an unhindered face. Based on this\\ndescription, we might expect to see
      that TS~bulky~ has higher steric\\nrepulsion than TS~unhindered~ (if we're lucky
      enough to find a way to\\nextract *E*~steric~ out of our EDA method). But it's
      also likely that\\nthe nucleophile might take a less favorable trajectory towards
      the\\noxocarbenium in TS~bulky~ to avoid steric repulsion, thus weakening key\\norbital
      interactions. These changes might even end up being larger in\\nmagnitude than
      the destabilization induced by steric repulsion. Is the\\ncorrect answer, then,
      that TS~bulky~ is higher in energy because of\\ndecreased *E*~orb~, not increased
      *E*~steric~?\\n\\nThe solution is to recognize that causation is not unique
      (cf.\\n[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)), and so there's\\nno
      one right answer here. Within the constraints of the EDA framework,\\nthe theorist
      wouldn't be incorrect in saying that *E*~orb~ is the\\ndriving factor---but
      the experimental chemist might reasonably expect\\n\\\"the bulky TS is destabilized
      by steric repulsion\\\" as their answer,\\nsince this is the root cause of the
      changes between the two structures.\\n(I side with the experimentalists here.)\\n\\nAnd
      the precisely defined concepts favored by theorists are often hard\\nfor experimental
      scientists to work with. Even if the correct answer in\\nthe above scenario
      were \\\"*TS*~bulky~ is destabilized by decreased\\norbital overlap\\\"---what's
      an experimentalist supposed to do with this\\ninformation, add more orbitals?
      (This is how I feel about Trevor\\nHamlin's work on Pauli repulsion.) The steric
      explanation at least\\nsuggests an intuitive solution (make the bulky group
      or the nucleophile\\nsmaller). If the purpose of EDA is to help people to understand\\nintermolecular
      interactions better on a conceptual level, I'm not sure\\nit's succeeding in
      most cases.\\n\\n(The only use of EDA that led to an actual experimental advance
      which\\nI'm aware of is Buchwald/Peng Liu's body of work on ligand--substrate\\ndispersion
      in hydrocupration:\\n[study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07373),
      [new\\nligand](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b09565), [ligand from\\nHartwig](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c08746).
      I don't think\\nit's a coincidence that these papers focus on dispersion, one
      of the\\neasiest pieces of EDA to decouple and understand.)\\n\\nI don't mean
      to be too critical here. The ability to break\\nintermolecular interactions
      down into different components is certainly\\nuseful, and it seems likely that
      some version of EDA will eventually\\nachieve consensus and emerge as a useful
      tool. But I think the utility\\nof EDA even in the best case is pretty limited.
      Quantum chemistry is\\ncomplicated, and if we think we can break it down into
      easy-to-digest\\ncomponents and eliminate the full nonlocal majesty of the Schrodinger\\nequation,
      we're lying to ourselves (or our experimental collaborators).\\nCompute with

      model for enzymatic catalysis states that enzymes are\n\"antibodies for the
      transition state\"---in other words, they\npreferentially bind to the transition
      state of a given reaction, rather\nthan the reactants or products. This binding
      interaction stabilizes the\nTS, thus lowering its energy and accelerating the
      reaction.\n\nThis is a pretty intuitive model, and one which is often employed
      when\nthinking about organocatalysis, particularly noncovalent\norganocatalysis.
      (It''s a bit harder to use this model when the mechanism\nchanges in a fundamental
      way, as with many organometallic reactions.)\nMany transition states have distinctive
      features, and it''s fun to think\nabout what interactions could be engineered
      to recognize and stabilize\nonly these features and nothing else in the reaction
      mixture.\n\n(For instance, chymotrypsin contains a dual hydrogen-bond motif
      called\nthe \"[oxyanion hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion_hole)\"
      which\nstabilizes developing negative charge in the Burgi--Dunitz TS for\nalcoholysis
      of amides. The negative charge is unique to the tetrahedral\nintermediate and
      the high-energy TSs to either side, so reactant/product\ninhibition isn''t a
      big issue. This motif can be mimicked by dual\nhydrogen-bond donor organocatalysts
      like the one my PhD lab specialized\nin.)\n\nThe downside of this approach to
      catalyst design is that each new sort\nof reaction mechanism requires a different
      sort of catalyst. One TS\nfeatures increasing negative charge at one place,
      while another features\nincreasing positive charge at another, and a third is
      practically\ncharge-neutral the whole way through. What if there were some feature\nthat
      was common to all transition states?\n\nA recent\n[preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64def1de694bf1540c8b1e3c?s=03)\nfrom
      Diptarka Hait and Martin Head-Gordon suggests an interesting answer\nto this
      question: polarizability. (Diptarka, despite just finishing his\nPhD, is a\n[prolific](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R2WrGKMAAAAJ&hl=en)\nscientist
      with a ton of different interests, and definitely someone to\nkeep an eye on.)
      The authors tackle the question of when precisely a\nstretching bond can be
      considered \"broken.\" An intuitive answer might be\n\"the transition state,\"
      but as the paper points out, plenty of\nbond-breaking potential energy surfaces
      lack clear transition states\n(e.g. H~2~, pictured below in red).\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44855db1-5d3c-4aa0-bead-2994e1daae7f_970x738.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      various polarizability\ncomponents shown in blue.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nInstead,
      the authors propose that polarizability is a good way to study\nthis question.
      As seen in the following graph, polarizability\n(particularly \u03b1~\\|\\|~,
      the component parallel to the bond axis) first\nincreases as a bond is stretched,
      and then decreases, with a sharp and\neasily identifiable maximum about where
      a bond might be considered to be\nbroken. This metric tracks with the conventional
      PES metric in cases\nwhere the PES is well-defined (see Fig. 5), which is comforting.
      Why\ndoes this occur?\n\n> The evolution of \u03b1 \\[polarizability\\] can
      be rationalized in the\n> following manner. Upon initially stretching H2 from
      equilibrium, the\n> bonding electrons fill up the additional accessible volume,
      resulting\n> in a more diffuse (and thus more polarizable) electron density.
      Post\n> bond cleavage however, the electrons start localizing on individual\n>
      atoms, leading to a decrease in polarizability.\n\nIn other words, electrons
      that are \"caught in the act\" of reorganizing\nbetween different atoms are
      more polarizable, whereas electrons which\nhave settled into their new atomic
      residences are less polarizable\nagain.\n\nThis is cool, but how can we apply
      this to catalysis? As it happens,\nthere are already a few publications\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y),\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y))
      from Dennis\nDougherty and coworkers dealing with exactly this question. They
      show\nthat cyclophanes are potent catalysts for S~N~2-type reactions that both\ncreate
      and destroy cations, and argue that polarizability, rather than\nany charge-recognition
      effect, undergirds the observed catalysis:\n\n> Since transition states have
      long, weak bonds, they are expected to be\n> more polarizable than ground-state
      substrates or products. The role of\n> the host is to surround the transition
      state with an\n> electron-rich-system that is polarizable and in a relatively
      fixed\n> orientation, so that induced dipoles in both the host and the\n> transition
      state are suitably aligned... Note that in this model, it\n> is not sufficient
      that polarizability contributes to binding.\n> Polarizability must be more important
      for binding transition states\n> than for binding ground states. Only in this
      way can it enhance\n> catalysis.\n\nTo defend this argument, the authors prepare
      a series of variously\nsubstituted cyclophanes, and show that while Hammett-type
      electronic\ntuning of the aryl rings has relatively small effects, adding more
      heavy\natoms always increases the rate, with the biggest effect observed with\nbromine
      (the heaviest element attempted). Heavier atoms are more\npolarizable, so this
      supports the argument that polarizability, rather\nthan any specific electrostatic
      effect, is responsible for catalysis.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e5c31e9-9208-4e3f-8592-626de6bb497d_1138x520.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      Pauling model for enzymatic catalysis states that enzymes are\\n\\\"antibodies
      for the transition state\\\"---in other words, they\\npreferentially bind to
      the transition state of a given reaction, rather\\nthan the reactants or products.
      This binding interaction stabilizes the\\nTS, thus lowering its energy and accelerating
      the reaction.\\n\\nThis is a pretty intuitive model, and one which is often
      employed when\\nthinking about organocatalysis, particularly noncovalent\\norganocatalysis.
      (It's a bit harder to use this model when the mechanism\\nchanges in a fundamental
      way, as with many organometallic reactions.)\\nMany transition states have distinctive
      features, and it's fun to think\\nabout what interactions could be engineered
      to recognize and stabilize\\nonly these features and nothing else in the reaction
      mixture.\\n\\n(For instance, chymotrypsin contains a dual hydrogen-bond motif
      called\\nthe \\\"[oxyanion hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion_hole)\\\"
      which\\nstabilizes developing negative charge in the Burgi--Dunitz TS for\\nalcoholysis
      of amides. The negative charge is unique to the tetrahedral\\nintermediate and
      the high-energy TSs to either side, so reactant/product\\ninhibition isn't a
      big issue. This motif can be mimicked by dual\\nhydrogen-bond donor organocatalysts
      like the one my PhD lab specialized\\nin.)\\n\\nThe downside of this approach
      to catalyst design is that each new sort\\nof reaction mechanism requires a
      different sort of catalyst. One TS\\nfeatures increasing negative charge at
      one place, while another features\\nincreasing positive charge at another, and
      a third is practically\\ncharge-neutral the whole way through. What if there
      were some feature\\nthat was common to all transition states?\\n\\nA recent\\n[preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64def1de694bf1540c8b1e3c?s=03)\\nfrom
      Diptarka Hait and Martin Head-Gordon suggests an interesting answer\\nto this
      question: polarizability. (Diptarka, despite just finishing his\\nPhD, is a\\n[prolific](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R2WrGKMAAAAJ&hl=en)\\nscientist
      with a ton of different interests, and definitely someone to\\nkeep an eye on.)
      The authors tackle the question of when precisely a\\nstretching bond can be
      considered \\\"broken.\\\" An intuitive answer might be\\n\\\"the transition
      state,\\\" but as the paper points out, plenty of\\nbond-breaking potential
      energy surfaces lack clear transition states\\n(e.g. H~2~, pictured below in
      red).\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44855db1-5d3c-4aa0-bead-2994e1daae7f_970x738.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      As seen in the following graph, polarizability\\n(particularly \u03B1~\\\\|\\\\|~,
      the component parallel to the bond axis) first\\nincreases as a bond is stretched,
      and then decreases, with a sharp and\\neasily identifiable maximum about where
      a bond might be considered to be\\nbroken. This metric tracks with the conventional
      PES metric in cases\\nwhere the PES is well-defined (see Fig. 5), which is comforting.

      from equilibrium, the\\n> bonding electrons fill up the additional accessible
      volume, resulting\\n> in a more diffuse (and thus more polarizable) electron
      density. Post\\n> bond cleavage however, the electrons start localizing on individual\\n>
      atoms, leading to a decrease in polarizability.\\n\\nIn other words, electrons
      that are \\\"caught in the act\\\" of reorganizing\\nbetween different atoms
      are more polarizable, whereas electrons which\\nhave settled into their new
      atomic residences are less polarizable\\nagain.\\n\\nThis is cool, but how can
      we apply this to catalysis? As it happens,\\nthere are already a few publications\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y))
      from Dennis\\nDougherty and coworkers dealing with exactly this question. They
      show\\nthat cyclophanes are potent catalysts for S~N~2-type reactions that both\\ncreate
      and destroy cations, and argue that polarizability, rather than\\nany charge-recognition
      effect, undergirds the observed catalysis:\\n\\n> Since transition states have
      long, weak bonds, they are expected to be\\n> more polarizable than ground-state
      substrates or products. The role of\\n> the host is to surround the transition
      state with an\\n> electron-rich-system that is polarizable and in a relatively
      fixed\\n> orientation, so that induced dipoles in both the host and the\\n>
      transition state are suitably aligned... Note that in this model, it\\n> is
      not sufficient that polarizability contributes to binding.\\n> Polarizability
      must be more important for binding transition states\\n> than for binding ground
      states. Only in this way can it enhance\\n> catalysis.\\n\\nTo defend this argument,
      the authors prepare a series of variously\\nsubstituted cyclophanes, and show
      that while Hammett-type electronic\\ntuning of the aryl rings has relatively
      small effects, adding more heavy\\natoms always increases the rate, with the
      biggest effect observed with\\nbromine (the heaviest element attempted). Heavier
      atoms are more\\npolarizable, so this supports the argument that polarizability,
      rather\\nthan any specific electrostatic effect, is responsible for catalysis.\\n\\n:::

      (It's a bit harder to use this model when the mechanism\\nchanges in a fundamental
      way, as with many organometallic reactions.)\\nMany transition states have distinctive
      features, and it's fun to think\\nabout what interactions could be engineered
      to recognize and stabilize\\nonly these features and nothing else in the reaction

      which\\nstabilizes developing negative charge in the Burgi--Dunitz TS for\\nalcoholysis
      of amides. The negative charge is unique to the tetrahedral\\nintermediate and

      big issue. This motif can be mimicked by dual\\nhydrogen-bond donor organocatalysts
      like the one my PhD lab specialized\\nin.)\\n\\nThe downside of this approach
      to catalyst design is that each new sort\\nof reaction mechanism requires a
      different sort of catalyst. One TS\\nfeatures increasing negative charge at
      one place, while another features\\nincreasing positive charge at another, and
      a third is practically\\ncharge-neutral the whole way through. What if there
      were some feature\\nthat was common to all transition states?\\n\\nA recent\\n[preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64def1de694bf1540c8b1e3c?s=03)\\nfrom
      Diptarka Hait and Martin Head-Gordon suggests an interesting answer\\nto this

      with a ton of different interests, and definitely someone to\\nkeep an eye on.)
      The authors tackle the question of when precisely a\\nstretching bond can be
      considered \\\"broken.\\\" An intuitive answer might be\\n\\\"the transition

      with various polarizability\\ncomponents shown in blue.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nInstead,
      the authors propose that polarizability is a good way to study\\nthis question.
      As seen in the following graph, polarizability\\n(particularly \u03B1~\\\\|\\\\|~,
      the component parallel to the bond axis) first\\nincreases as a bond is stretched,
      and then decreases, with a sharp and\\neasily identifiable maximum about where
      a bond might be considered to be\\nbroken. This metric tracks with the conventional
      PES metric in cases\\nwhere the PES is well-defined (see Fig. 5), which is comforting.
      Why\\ndoes this occur?\\n\\n> The evolution of \u03B1 \\\\[polarizability\\\\]
      can be rationalized in the\\n> following manner. Upon initially stretching H2
      from equilibrium, the\\n> bonding electrons fill up the additional accessible
      volume, resulting\\n> in a more diffuse (and thus more polarizable) electron
      density. Post\\n> bond cleavage however, the electrons start localizing on individual\\n>
      atoms, leading to a decrease in polarizability.\\n\\nIn other words, electrons
      that are \\\"caught in the act\\\" of reorganizing\\nbetween different atoms
      are more polarizable, whereas electrons which\\nhave settled into their new
      atomic residences are less polarizable\\nagain.\\n\\nThis is cool, but how can
      we apply this to catalysis? As it happens,\\nthere are already a few publications\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo960521y))
      from Dennis\\nDougherty and coworkers dealing with exactly this question. They
      show\\nthat cyclophanes are potent catalysts for S~N~2-type reactions that both\\ncreate
      and destroy cations, and argue that polarizability, rather than\\nany charge-recognition
      effect, undergirds the observed catalysis:\\n\\n> Since transition states have
      long, weak bonds, they are expected to be\\n> more polarizable than ground-state
      substrates or products. The role of\\n> the host is to surround the transition
      state with an\\n> electron-rich-system that is polarizable and in a relatively
      fixed\\n> orientation, so that induced dipoles in both the host and the\\n>
      transition state are suitably aligned... Note that in this model, it\\n> is
      not sufficient that polarizability contributes to binding.\\n> Polarizability
      must be more important for binding transition states\\n> than for binding ground
      states. Only in this way can it enhance\\n> catalysis.\\n\\nTo defend this argument,
      the authors prepare a series of variously\\nsubstituted cyclophanes, and show
      that while Hammett-type electronic\\ntuning of the aryl rings has relatively
      small effects, adding more heavy\\natoms always increases the rate, with the
      biggest effect observed with\\nbromine (the heaviest element attempted). Heavier
      atoms are more\\npolarizable, so this supports the argument that polarizability,
      rather\\nthan any specific electrostatic effect, is responsible for catalysis.\\n\\n:::

      ostensible purpose of organic methodology is to develop\nreactions that are
      useful in the real world, the utility of a method is\nin large part dictated
      by the accessibility of the starting materials.\nIf a compound is difficult
      to synthesize or hazardous to work with, then\nit''s difficult to convince people
      to use it in a reaction (e.g. most\ndiazoalkanes). Organic chemists are pragmatic,
      and would usually prefer\nto run a reaction that starts from a commercial and
      bench-stable\nstarting material.\n\nFor instance, this explains the immense
      popularity of the Suzuki\nreaction: although the Neigishi reaction (using organozinc
      nucleophiles)\nusually works better for the same substrates, you can buy lots
      of the\norganoboron nucleophiles needed to run a Suzuki and leave them lying\naround
      without taking any precautions. In contrast, organozinc compounds\nusually have
      to be made from the corresponding organolithium/Grignard\nreagent and used freshly,
      which is considerably more annoying.\n\nThe ideal starting material, then, is
      one which is commercially\navailable and cheap. In recent years, it''s become
      popular to advertise\nnew synthetic methods by showing that they work on exceptionally
      cheap\nand common functional groups, and in particular to compare the abundance\nof
      different functional groups to demonstrate that one starting material\nis more
      common than another. To pick just one of many examples, Dave\nMacMillan used
      this plot to show why cross-coupling reactions of\nalcohols were important\n([ref](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/Zhe.pdf)):\n\n:::

      well.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhen I saw MacMillan''s talk at MIT
      last year, I was curious what it\nwould take to make additional graphics like
      this. The \"number of\nreactions\" plot can be made pretty easily from Reaxys,
      but I''ve always\nbeen uncertain how the \"number of commercial sources\" plots
      are made: I\nhaven''t seen references listed for these numbers, nor is anything\nusually
      found in the Supporting Information.\n\nI decided to take a swing at getting
      this data myself by analyzing the\n[Mcule](https://mcule.com/database/) \\\"building
      blocks\\\" database, which\ncontains about 3.5 million compounds. Although Mcule
      doesn\\''t define\nwhat a building block is (at least, not that I can find),
      it''s likely\nthat their definition is similar to that of ZINC, which defines
      building\nblocks as \"those catalogs of compounds available in preparative\nquantities,
      typically 250 mg or more\"\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559)).
      This\nseems like a reasonable proxy for the sorts of compounds synthetic\nchemists
      might use in reactions. I defined patterns to match a bunch of\nfunctional groups
      using SMARTS/SMILES, and then used RDKit to find\nmatches in the Mcule building
      blocks database. The code can be found on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule),\nalong
      with the patterns I used.\n\nThe results are shown below. As expected, ethers,
      amines, amides, and\nalcohols are quite common. Surprisingly, aryl chlorides
      aren\\''t that\nmuch more common than aryl bromides---and, except for aliphatic\nfluorides,
      all aliphatic halides are quite rare. Allenes, carbodiimides,\nand SF5 groups
      are virtually unheard of (\\<100 examples).\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ccf67ab-d6f5-44ad-a90d-5e0d262ed445_630x1272.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      it''s an image, because Substack doesn''t do tables\nevidently---see\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230804_abundance.html)\nfor
      copyable numbers)*\n\n(Fair warning: I''ve spotchecked a number of the SMILES
      files generated\n(also on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule/output)),\nbut
      I haven''t looked through every molecule, so it''s possible that there\nare
      some faulty matches. I wouldn''t consider these publication-quality\nnumbers
      yet.)\n\nAn obvious caveat: there are lots of commercially \"rare\" functional\ngroups
      which are easily accessible from more abundant functional groups.\nFor instance,
      acid chlorides seem uncommon in the above table, but can\nusually be made from
      ubiquitous carboxylic acids with e.g. SOCl2. So\nthese data shouldn''t be taken
      as a proxy for a more holistic measure of\nsynthetic accessibility---they measure
      commercial availability, that''s\nall.\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from
      this?\n\n- The most common functional groups are the milquetoast ones: alcohols,\n  amines,
      esters, etc. Perhaps this explains [where all the new\n  reactions have\n  gone](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409):\n  unless
      your new method works on alcohols or amines, it will struggle\n  to get traction
      in most of chemical space relative to e.g. Williamson\n  ether synthesis or
      reductive amination. (Kudos to MacMillan for\n  identifying this; *vide supra*.)\n\n-
      Ureas are much more common than you''d expect from academic methods\n  papers.
      This I think speaks to the difference between what\n  methodologists want and
      what medicinal chemists want. Ureas are a bit\n  annoying to work with: they''re
      pretty polar by the standards of\n  academia, they''re not always soluble in
      organic solvents, and they\n  have a tendency to stick to transition metal catalysts
      or get\n  deprotonated by strong bases. But they''re easy to make in libraries,\n  since
      the isocyanate/amine disconnection is so robust, and they''re\n  excellent hydrogen-bond
      donors and acceptors. **CORRECTION: There\\''s a\n  SMARTS error, so the match
      for \\\"ureas\\\" actually matches\n  amides---disregard this section. Thanks
      to\n  [@wmdhn](https://twitter.com/wmdhn) for catching this.**\n\n- Uncommon
      functional groups, like SF~5~ and allenes, are very uncommon.\n  If you want
      to introduce an SF~5~ group, you are in for a rough time:\n  there aren''t great
      ways to add it to molecules (although there have\n  been some steps forward
      [in recent\n  years](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.202201491)),\n  and
      there are only 18 commercial examples. So people can write as many\n  [papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728329/)
      as\n  they want about how cool SF~5~ groups are: I still doubt we''ll see\n  them
      used very much in the near future.\n\n- But also, the abundance of a given functional
      group is very elastic in\n  the long run. Trifluoromethyl groups used to be
      extremely\n  rare---they''re not found in nature!---but now 1 in 8 molecules
      has a\n  CF~3~ group. CF~3~ just turns out to be a very good handle for a lot\n  of
      molecular design tasks, and so people found ways to introduce it\n  all over
      the place, and now it''s not hard to get molecules that have\n  trifluoromethyl
      groups. Synthetic chemists should feel good about\n  this.\n\nThe functional-group-specific
      SMILES files are in the previously\nmentioned Github repo, so anyone who wants
      to e.g. look through all the\ncommercially available alkenes and perform further
      cheminformatics\nanalyses can do so. I hope the attached code and data helps
      other\nchemists perform similar, and better, studies, and that this sort of\nthinking
      can be useful for those who are currently engaged in reaction\ndiscovery.\n\n*Thanks
      to Eric Jacobsen for helpful conversations about these data.*\n", "images":

      the ostensible purpose of organic methodology is to develop\nreactions that
      are useful in the real world, the utility of a method is\nin large part dictated
      by the accessibility of the starting materials.\nIf a compound is difficult
      to synthesize or hazardous to work with, then\nit''s difficult to convince people
      to use it in a reaction (e.g. most\ndiazoalkanes). Organic chemists are pragmatic,
      and would usually prefer\nto run a reaction that starts from a commercial and
      bench-stable\nstarting material.\n\nFor instance, this explains the immense
      popularity of the Suzuki\nreaction: although the Neigishi reaction (using organozinc
      nucleophiles)\nusually works better for the same substrates, you can buy lots
      of the\norganoboron nucleophiles needed to run a Suzuki and leave them lying\naround
      without taking any precautions. In contrast, organozinc compounds\nusually have
      to be made from the corresponding organolithium/Grignard\nreagent and used freshly,
      which is considerably more annoying.\n\nThe ideal starting material, then, is
      one which is commercially\navailable and cheap. In recent years, it''s become
      popular to advertise\nnew synthetic methods by showing that they work on exceptionally
      cheap\nand common functional groups, and in particular to compare the abundance\nof
      different functional groups to demonstrate that one starting material\nis more
      common than another. To pick just one of many examples, Dave\nMacMillan used
      this plot to show why cross-coupling reactions of\nalcohols were important\n([ref](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/Zhe.pdf)):\n\n:::

      well.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhen I saw MacMillan''s talk at MIT
      last year, I was curious what it\nwould take to make additional graphics like
      this. The \"number of\nreactions\" plot can be made pretty easily from Reaxys,
      but I''ve always\nbeen uncertain how the \"number of commercial sources\" plots
      are made: I\nhaven''t seen references listed for these numbers, nor is anything\nusually
      found in the Supporting Information.\n\nI decided to take a swing at getting
      this data myself by analyzing the\n[Mcule](https://mcule.com/database/) \\\"building
      blocks\\\" database, which\ncontains about 3.5 million compounds. Although Mcule
      doesn\\''t define\nwhat a building block is (at least, not that I can find),
      it''s likely\nthat their definition is similar to that of ZINC, which defines
      building\nblocks as \"those catalogs of compounds available in preparative\nquantities,
      typically 250 mg or more\"\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559)).
      This\nseems like a reasonable proxy for the sorts of compounds synthetic\nchemists
      might use in reactions. I defined patterns to match a bunch of\nfunctional groups
      using SMARTS/SMILES, and then used RDKit to find\nmatches in the Mcule building
      blocks database. The code can be found on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule),\nalong
      with the patterns I used.\n\nThe results are shown below. As expected, ethers,
      amines, amides, and\nalcohols are quite common. Surprisingly, aryl chlorides
      aren\\''t that\nmuch more common than aryl bromides---and, except for aliphatic\nfluorides,
      all aliphatic halides are quite rare. Allenes, carbodiimides,\nand SF5 groups
      are virtually unheard of (\\<100 examples).\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ccf67ab-d6f5-44ad-a90d-5e0d262ed445_630x1272.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      it''s an image, because Substack doesn''t do tables\nevidently---see\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230804_abundance.html)\nfor
      copyable numbers)*\n\n(Fair warning: I''ve spotchecked a number of the SMILES
      files generated\n(also on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule/output)),\nbut
      I haven''t looked through every molecule, so it''s possible that there\nare
      some faulty matches. I wouldn''t consider these publication-quality\nnumbers
      yet.)\n\nAn obvious caveat: there are lots of commercially \"rare\" functional\ngroups
      which are easily accessible from more abundant functional groups.\nFor instance,
      acid chlorides seem uncommon in the above table, but can\nusually be made from
      ubiquitous carboxylic acids with e.g. SOCl2. So\nthese data shouldn''t be taken
      as a proxy for a more holistic measure of\nsynthetic accessibility---they measure
      commercial availability, that''s\nall.\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from
      this?\n\n- The most common functional groups are the milquetoast ones: alcohols,\n  amines,
      esters, etc. Perhaps this explains [where all the new\n  reactions have\n  gone](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409):\n  unless
      your new method works on alcohols or amines, it will struggle\n  to get traction
      in most of chemical space relative to e.g. Williamson\n  ether synthesis or
      reductive amination. (Kudos to MacMillan for\n  identifying this; *vide supra*.)\n\n-
      Ureas are much more common than you''d expect from academic methods\n  papers.
      This I think speaks to the difference between what\n  methodologists want and
      what medicinal chemists want. Ureas are a bit\n  annoying to work with: they''re
      pretty polar by the standards of\n  academia, they''re not always soluble in
      organic solvents, and they\n  have a tendency to stick to transition metal catalysts
      or get\n  deprotonated by strong bases. But they''re easy to make in libraries,\n  since
      the isocyanate/amine disconnection is so robust, and they''re\n  excellent hydrogen-bond
      donors and acceptors. **CORRECTION: There\\''s a\n  SMARTS error, so the match
      for \\\"ureas\\\" actually matches\n  amides---disregard this section. Thanks
      to\n  [@wmdhn](https://twitter.com/wmdhn) for catching this.**\n\n- Uncommon
      functional groups, like SF~5~ and allenes, are very uncommon.\n  If you want
      to introduce an SF~5~ group, you are in for a rough time:\n  there aren''t great
      ways to add it to molecules (although there have\n  been some steps forward
      [in recent\n  years](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.202201491)),\n  and
      there are only 18 commercial examples. So people can write as many\n  [papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728329/)
      as\n  they want about how cool SF~5~ groups are: I still doubt we''ll see\n  them
      used very much in the near future.\n\n- But also, the abundance of a given functional
      group is very elastic in\n  the long run. Trifluoromethyl groups used to be
      extremely\n  rare---they''re not found in nature!---but now 1 in 8 molecules
      has a\n  CF~3~ group. CF~3~ just turns out to be a very good handle for a lot\n  of
      molecular design tasks, and so people found ways to introduce it\n  all over
      the place, and now it''s not hard to get molecules that have\n  trifluoromethyl
      groups. Synthetic chemists should feel good about\n  this.\n\nThe functional-group-specific
      SMILES files are in the previously\nmentioned Github repo, so anyone who wants
      to e.g. look through all the\ncommercially available alkenes and perform further
      cheminformatics\nanalyses can do so. I hope the attached code and data helps
      other\nchemists perform similar, and better, studies, and that this sort of\nthinking
      can be useful for those who are currently engaged in reaction\ndiscovery.\n\n*Thanks
      to Eric Jacobsen for helpful conversations about these data.*\n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"135711308","updated":false,"category":"chemicalSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      the ostensible purpose of organic methodology is to develop\nreactions that
      are useful in the real world, the utility of a method is\nin large part dictated
      by the accessibility of the starting materials.\nIf a compound is difficult
      to synthesize or hazardous to work with, then\nit''s difficult to convince people
      to use it in a reaction (e.g. most\ndiazoalkanes). Organic chemists are pragmatic,
      and would usually prefer\nto run a reaction that starts from a commercial and
      bench-stable\nstarting material.\n\nFor instance, this explains the immense
      popularity of the Suzuki\nreaction: although the Neigishi reaction (using organozinc
      nucleophiles)\nusually works better for the same substrates, you can buy lots
      of the\norganoboron nucleophiles needed to run a Suzuki and leave them lying\naround
      without taking any precautions. In contrast, organozinc compounds\nusually have
      to be made from the corresponding organolithium/Grignard\nreagent and used freshly,
      which is considerably more annoying.\n\nThe ideal starting material, then, is
      one which is commercially\navailable and cheap. In recent years, it''s become
      popular to advertise\nnew synthetic methods by showing that they work on exceptionally
      cheap\nand common functional groups, and in particular to compare the abundance\nof
      different functional groups to demonstrate that one starting material\nis more
      common than another. To pick just one of many examples, Dave\nMacMillan used
      this plot to show why cross-coupling reactions of\nalcohols were important\n([ref](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/Zhe.pdf)):\n\n:::

      well.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhen I saw MacMillan''s talk at MIT
      last year, I was curious what it\nwould take to make additional graphics like
      this. The \"number of\nreactions\" plot can be made pretty easily from Reaxys,
      but I''ve always\nbeen uncertain how the \"number of commercial sources\" plots
      are made: I\nhaven''t seen references listed for these numbers, nor is anything\nusually
      found in the Supporting Information.\n\nI decided to take a swing at getting
      this data myself by analyzing the\n[Mcule](https://mcule.com/database/) \\\"building
      blocks\\\" database, which\ncontains about 3.5 million compounds. Although Mcule
      doesn\\''t define\nwhat a building block is (at least, not that I can find),
      it''s likely\nthat their definition is similar to that of ZINC, which defines
      building\nblocks as \"those catalogs of compounds available in preparative\nquantities,
      typically 250 mg or more\"\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559)).
      This\nseems like a reasonable proxy for the sorts of compounds synthetic\nchemists
      might use in reactions. I defined patterns to match a bunch of\nfunctional groups
      using SMARTS/SMILES, and then used RDKit to find\nmatches in the Mcule building
      blocks database. The code can be found on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule),\nalong
      with the patterns I used.\n\nThe results are shown below. As expected, ethers,
      amines, amides, and\nalcohols are quite common. Surprisingly, aryl chlorides
      aren\\''t that\nmuch more common than aryl bromides---and, except for aliphatic\nfluorides,
      all aliphatic halides are quite rare. Allenes, carbodiimides,\nand SF5 groups
      are virtually unheard of (\\<100 examples).\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ccf67ab-d6f5-44ad-a90d-5e0d262ed445_630x1272.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      it''s an image, because Substack doesn''t do tables\nevidently---see\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230804_abundance.html)\nfor
      copyable numbers)*\n\n(Fair warning: I''ve spotchecked a number of the SMILES
      files generated\n(also on\n[Github](https://github.com/corinwagen/scratchpad/tree/master/mcule/output)),\nbut
      I haven''t looked through every molecule, so it''s possible that there\nare
      some faulty matches. I wouldn''t consider these publication-quality\nnumbers
      yet.)\n\nAn obvious caveat: there are lots of commercially \"rare\" functional\ngroups
      which are easily accessible from more abundant functional groups.\nFor instance,
      acid chlorides seem uncommon in the above table, but can\nusually be made from
      ubiquitous carboxylic acids with e.g. SOCl2. So\nthese data shouldn''t be taken
      as a proxy for a more holistic measure of\nsynthetic accessibility---they measure
      commercial availability, that''s\nall.\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw from
      this?\n\n- The most common functional groups are the milquetoast ones: alcohols,\n  amines,
      esters, etc. Perhaps this explains [where all the new\n  reactions have\n  gone](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409):\n  unless
      your new method works on alcohols or amines, it will struggle\n  to get traction
      in most of chemical space relative to e.g. Williamson\n  ether synthesis or
      reductive amination. (Kudos to MacMillan for\n  identifying this; *vide supra*.)\n\n-
      Ureas are much more common than you''d expect from academic methods\n  papers.
      This I think speaks to the difference between what\n  methodologists want and
      what medicinal chemists want. Ureas are a bit\n  annoying to work with: they''re
      pretty polar by the standards of\n  academia, they''re not always soluble in
      organic solvents, and they\n  have a tendency to stick to transition metal catalysts
      or get\n  deprotonated by strong bases. But they''re easy to make in libraries,\n  since
      the isocyanate/amine disconnection is so robust, and they''re\n  excellent hydrogen-bond
      donors and acceptors. **CORRECTION: There\\''s a\n  SMARTS error, so the match
      for \\\"ureas\\\" actually matches\n  amides---disregard this section. Thanks
      to\n  [@wmdhn](https://twitter.com/wmdhn) for catching this.**\n\n- Uncommon
      functional groups, like SF~5~ and allenes, are very uncommon.\n  If you want
      to introduce an SF~5~ group, you are in for a rough time:\n  there aren''t great
      ways to add it to molecules (although there have\n  been some steps forward
      [in recent\n  years](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.202201491)),\n  and
      there are only 18 commercial examples. So people can write as many\n  [papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728329/)
      as\n  they want about how cool SF~5~ groups are: I still doubt we''ll see\n  them
      used very much in the near future.\n\n- But also, the abundance of a given functional
      group is very elastic in\n  the long run. Trifluoromethyl groups used to be
      extremely\n  rare---they''re not found in nature!---but now 1 in 8 molecules
      has a\n  CF~3~ group. CF~3~ just turns out to be a very good handle for a lot\n  of
      molecular design tasks, and so people found ways to introduce it\n  all over
      the place, and now it''s not hard to get molecules that have\n  trifluoromethyl
      groups. Synthetic chemists should feel good about\n  this.\n\nThe functional-group-specific
      SMILES files are in the previously\nmentioned Github repo, so anyone who wants
      to e.g. look through all the\ncommercially available alkenes and perform further
      cheminformatics\nanalyses can do so. I hope the attached code and data helps
      other\nchemists perform similar, and better, studies, and that this sort of\nthinking
      can be useful for those who are currently engaged in reaction\ndiscovery.\n\n*Thanks

      about molecular dynamics.*\n\nIn his fantastic essay \"[The Two\nCultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures),\"
      C. P. Snow\nobserved that there was (in 1950s England) a growing divide between
      the\nacademic cultures of science and the humanities:\n\n> Literary intellectuals
      at one pole---at the other scientists, and as\n> the most representative, the
      physical scientists. Between the two a\n> gulf of mutual incomprehension---sometimes
      (particularly among the\n> young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack
      of understanding.\n> They have a curious distorted image of each other. Their
      attitudes are\n> so different that, even on the level of emotion, they can\\''t
      find much\n> common ground.\n\nHe reflects on the origins of this phenomenon,
      which he contends is new\nto the 20th century, and argues that it ought to be
      opposed:\n\n> This polarisation is sheer loss to us all. To us as people, and
      to our\n> society. It is at the same time practical and intellectual and\n>
      creative loss, and I repeat that it is false to imagine that those\n> three
      considerations are clearly separable. But for a moment I want to\n> concentrate
      on the intellectual loss.\n\nSnow''s essay is wonderful: his portrait of a vanishing
      cultural\nintellectual unity should inspire us all, scientists and otherwise,
      to\nimprove ourselves, and the elegiac prose reminds the reader that even\nthe
      best cultural institutions are fragile and fleeting things.\n\nI want to make
      an analogous---but much less powerful---observation about\nthe two cultures
      present in atomistic simulation. I''ll call these the\n\"QM tribe\" and the
      \"MD tribe\" for convenience: crudely, \"people who use\nGaussian/ORCA/Psi4
      for their research\" and \"people who use\nSchrodinger/AMBER/OpenMM/LAMMPS for
      their research,\" respectively.\nAlthough this dichotomy is crude, I contend
      there are real differences\nbetween these two groups, and that their disunity
      hurts scientific\nprogress.\n\n## **The Nature of Energy Surfaces**\n\nThe most
      fundamental disagreement between these two cultures is in how\nthey think about
      energy surfaces, I think. Most QM-tribe people think in\nterms of optimizing
      to discrete critical points on the potential energy\nsurface: one can perform
      some sort of gradient-informed optimization to\na ground state, or follow negative
      eigenvalues to a transition state.\n\nImplicit to this assumption is that there
      exist well-defined critical\npoints on the PES, and that finding such critical
      points is meaningful\nand productive. Conformers exist, and many people now
      compute properties\nas Boltzmann-weighted averages over conformational ensembles,
      but this\nis usually done for 10--100 conformers, not thousands or millions.\nEntropy
      and solvation, if they''re considered at all, are viewed as\ncorrections, not
      key factors: since QM is so frequently used to study\nhigh-barrier bond-breaking
      processes where enthalpic factors dominate,\none can often get reasonable results
      with cartoonish treatments of\nentropy.\n\nIn contrast, MD-tribe scientists
      generally don''t think about transition\nstates as specific configurations of
      atoms---rather, a transition state\ncan emerge from some sort of simulation
      involving biased sampling, but\nit''s just a position along some abstract reaction
      coordinate, rather\nthan a structure which can be visualized in CYLView. Any
      information\ngleaned is statistical, rather than concretely visual (e.g. \"what
      is the\nmean number of hydrogen bonds to this oxygen near this transition\nstate\").\n\nUnlike
      the QM tribe, MD-tribe scientists generally cannot study\nbond-breaking processes,
      and so focus on conformational processes\n(protein folding, aggregation, nucleation,
      transport) where entropy and\nsolvation are of critical importance: as such,
      free energy is almost\nalways taken into consideration by MD-tribe scientists,
      and the\nunderlying PES itself is rarely (to my knowledge) viewed as a worthy\ntopic
      of study in and of itself.\n\n## **Molecular Representations**\n\nThis divide
      also affects how the two cultures view the task of molecular\nrepresentation.
      QM-tribe scientists generally view a list of coordinates\nand atomic numbers
      as the most logical representation of a molecule\n(perhaps with charge and multiplicity
      information). To the QM tribe, a\nminimum on the PES represents a structure,
      and different minima\nnaturally ought to have different representations. Bonding
      and bond\norder are not specified, because QM methods can figure that out without\nassistance
      (and it''s not uncommon for bonds to change in a QM simulation\nanyway).\n\nIn
      contrast, people in the MD tribe generally want a molecular\nrepresentation
      that''s independent of conformation, since many different\nconformations will
      intrinsically be considered. (See Connor Coley''s\n[presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMZ8GHvvJv_jhy8t6fH73wv4e9ZjHwUN/view)\nfrom
      a recent MolSSI workshop for a discussion of this.) Thus, it''s\ncommon to represent
      molecules through their topology, where connectivity\nand bond order are explicitly
      specified. This allows for some pretty\nwild [simulations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00241a001)
      of\nspecies that would be reactive in a QM simulation, but also means that\ne.g.
      tautomers can be a massive problem in MD\n([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9920-5)),\nsince
      protons can''t equilibrate freely.\n\nFor property prediction, an uneasy compromise
      can be reached wherein one\ntakes a SMILES string, performs a conformational
      search, and then\nBoltzmann-averages properties over all different conformers,
      to return a\nset of values which are associated only with the SMILES string
      and not\nany individual conformation. (Matt Sigman does this, as does Bobby
      Paton\n[for NMR prediction.](https://nova.chem.colostate.edu/cascade/predict/))\nThis
      is a lot of work, though.\n\n## **\"A Gulf Of Mutual Incomprehension\"**\n\nThese
      differences also become apparent when comparing the software\npackages that
      different tribes use. Take, for instance, the task of\npredicting partial charges
      for a given small molecule. A QM-tribe\nscientist would expect these charges
      to be a function of the geometry,\nwhereas an MD-tribe scientist would want
      the results to be explicitly\ngeometry-independent\n([e.g.](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(22)01326-1))\nso
      that they can be used for subsequent MD simulations.\n\nThe assumptions implicit
      to these worldviews mean that it''s often quite\ndifficult to go from QM-tribe
      software packages to MD-tribe software\npackages or vice versa. I''ve been\n[stymied](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/611)\nbefore
      by trying to get OpenMM and openforcefield to work on organic\nmolecules for
      which I had a list of coordinates and not e.g. a SMILES\nstring---although obviously
      coordinates will at some point be needed in\nthe MD simulation, most workflows
      expect you to start from a topology\nand not an xyz file.\n\nSimilarly, it''s
      [very\ndifficult](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview/issues/589#issuecomment-468339971)\nto
      get the graphics package NGLView to illustrate the process of bonds\nbreaking
      and forming---NGLView is typically used for MD, and expects\nthat the system''s
      topology will be defined at the start of the\nsimulation and never changed.
      (There are kludgy workarounds, like\ndefining a new object for every frame,
      but it''s nevertheless true that\nNGLView is not made for QM-tribe people.)\n\n(I''m
      sure that MD-tribe people are very frustrated by QM software as\nwell, but I
      don''t have as much experience going in this direction. In\ngeneral, MD tooling
      seems quite a bit more advanced than QM-tribe\ntooling; most MD people I''ve
      talked to seem to interact with QM software\nas little as possible, and I can''t
      say I blame them.)\n\n## **\"A Curious Distorted Image of Each Other\"**\n\nThere
      are also cultural factors to consider here. The questions that\nQM-tribe scientists
      think about are different than those that MD-tribe\nscientists think about:
      a somewhat famous QM expert once told me that\nthey were \"stuck on an ivory
      tower where people hold their nose when it\ncomes to DFT, forget anything more
      approximate,\" whereas MD-tribe\nscientists often seem alarmingly unconcerned
      about forcefield error but\nare obsessed with proper sampling and simulation
      convergence.\n\nIt seems that most people have only a vague sense of what their\ncongeners
      in the other tribe actually work on. I don''t think most\nQM-tribe scientists
      I know have ever run or analyzed a regular molecular\ndynamics simulation using
      e.g. AMBER or OpenMM, nor do I expect that\nmost MD-tribe scientists have tried
      to find a transition state in\nGaussian or ORCA. In theory, coursework could
      remedy this, but education\nfor QM alone already seems chaotic and ad hoc---trying
      to cram in MD,\nstatistical mechanics, etc is probably ill-advised at the present.\n\nSocial
      considerations also play a role. There''s limited crosstalk\nbetween the two
      fields, especially at the trainee level. How many QM\npeople even know who Prayush
      Tiwary is, or Michael Shirts, or Jay\nPonder? How many MD graduate students
      have heard of Frank Neese or Troy\nVan Voorhis? As always, generational talent
      manages to transcend narrow\nboundaries---but rank-and-file scientists would
      benefit immensely from\nincreased contact with the other tribe.\n\n## **\"Unite
      Them\"**\n\nI''m not an expert on the history of chemistry, but my understanding
      is\nthat the two fields were not always so different: Martin Karplus, Arieh\nWarshel,
      and Bill Jorgensen, key figures in the development of modern\nMD, were also
      formidable quantum chemists. (If any famous chemists who\nread this blog care
      to share their thoughts on this history, please\nemail me: you know who you
      are!)\n\nAnd as the two fields advance, I think they will come closer together\nonce
      more. As QM becomes capable of tackling larger and larger systems,\nQM-tribe
      scientists will be forced to deal with more and more\ncomplicated conformational
      landscapes: modern enantioselective catalysts\nroutinely have hundreds of ground-state
      complexes to consider\n([ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/sc/d2sc02274e)),\nand
      QSimulate and Amgen recently reported full DFT calculations on\nprotein--ligand
      complexes\n([ref](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/345075772.pdf)).\n\nSimilarly,
      the increase in computing power means that many MD use cases\n(like FEP) are
      now limited not by insufficient sampling but by the poor\nenergetics of the
      forcefields they employ. This is difficult to prove\nunequivocally, but I''ve
      heard this in interviews with industry folks,\nand there are certainly plenty
      of references complaining about poor\nforcefield accuracy\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00801),\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01081)):
      a Psivant\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00564) dryly
      notes\nthat \"historically solvation energy errors on the order of 2--3 kcal/mol\nhave
      been considered to be accurate,\" which is hardly encouraging.\n\nMany QM-tribe
      professors now work on dynamics: Dean Tantillo and Todd\nMartinez (who have
      long been voices \"crying out in the wilderness\" for\ndynamics) perhaps most
      prominently, but also Steven Lopez, Daniel Ess,\nFernanda Duarte, Peng Liu,
      etc. And MD-tribe professors seem more and\nmore interested in using ML mimics
      of QM to replace forcefields\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227959v1)),\nwhich
      will inevitably lead them down the speed--accuracy rabbit hole\nthat is quantum

      and the elegiac prose reminds the reader that even\\nthe best cultural institutions
      are fragile and fleeting things.\\n\\nI want to make an analogous---but much
      less powerful---observation about\\nthe two cultures present in atomistic simulation.
      I'll call these the\\n\\\"QM tribe\\\" and the \\\"MD tribe\\\" for convenience:
      crudely, \\\"people who use\\nGaussian/ORCA/Psi4 for their research\\\" and
      \\\"people who use\\nSchrodinger/AMBER/OpenMM/LAMMPS for their research,\\\"
      respectively.\\nAlthough this dichotomy is crude, I contend there are real differences\\nbetween
      these two groups, and that their disunity hurts scientific\\nprogress.\\n\\n##
      **The Nature of Energy Surfaces**\\n\\nThe most fundamental disagreement between
      these two cultures is in how\\nthey think about energy surfaces, I think. Most
      QM-tribe people think in\\nterms of optimizing to discrete critical points on
      the potential energy\\nsurface: one can perform some sort of gradient-informed
      optimization to\\na ground state, or follow negative eigenvalues to a transition
      state.\\n\\nImplicit to this assumption is that there exist well-defined critical\\npoints
      on the PES, and that finding such critical points is meaningful\\nand productive.
      Conformers exist, and many people now compute properties\\nas Boltzmann-weighted
      averages over conformational ensembles, but this\\nis usually done for 10--100
      conformers, not thousands or millions.\\nEntropy and solvation, if they're considered
      at all, are viewed as\\ncorrections, not key factors: since QM is so frequently
      used to study\\nhigh-barrier bond-breaking processes where enthalpic factors
      dominate,\\none can often get reasonable results with cartoonish treatments
      of\\nentropy.\\n\\nIn contrast, MD-tribe scientists generally don't think about
      transition\\nstates as specific configurations of atoms---rather, a transition
      state\\ncan emerge from some sort of simulation involving biased sampling, but\\nit's
      just a position along some abstract reaction coordinate, rather\\nthan a structure
      which can be visualized in CYLView. Any information\\ngleaned is statistical,
      rather than concretely visual (e.g. \\\"what is the\\nmean number of hydrogen
      bonds to this oxygen near this transition\\nstate\\\").\\n\\nUnlike the QM tribe,
      MD-tribe scientists generally cannot study\\nbond-breaking processes, and so
      focus on conformational processes\\n(protein folding, aggregation, nucleation,
      transport) where entropy and\\nsolvation are of critical importance: as such,
      free energy is almost\\nalways taken into consideration by MD-tribe scientists,
      and the\\nunderlying PES itself is rarely (to my knowledge) viewed as a worthy\\ntopic
      of study in and of itself.\\n\\n## **Molecular Representations**\\n\\nThis divide
      also affects how the two cultures view the task of molecular\\nrepresentation.
      QM-tribe scientists generally view a list of coordinates\\nand atomic numbers
      as the most logical representation of a molecule\\n(perhaps with charge and
      multiplicity information). To the QM tribe, a\\nminimum on the PES represents
      a structure, and different minima\\nnaturally ought to have different representations.
      Bonding and bond\\norder are not specified, because QM methods can figure that
      out without\\nassistance (and it's not uncommon for bonds to change in a QM
      simulation\\nanyway).\\n\\nIn contrast, people in the MD tribe generally want
      a molecular\\nrepresentation that's independent of conformation, since many
      different\\nconformations will intrinsically be considered. (See Connor Coley's\\n[presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMZ8GHvvJv_jhy8t6fH73wv4e9ZjHwUN/view)\\nfrom
      a recent MolSSI workshop for a discussion of this.) Thus, it's\\ncommon to represent
      molecules through their topology, where connectivity\\nand bond order are explicitly
      specified. This allows for some pretty\\nwild [simulations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00241a001)
      of\\nspecies that would be reactive in a QM simulation, but also means that\\ne.g.
      tautomers can be a massive problem in MD\\n([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9920-5)),\\nsince
      protons can't equilibrate freely.\\n\\nFor property prediction, an uneasy compromise
      can be reached wherein one\\ntakes a SMILES string, performs a conformational
      search, and then\\nBoltzmann-averages properties over all different conformers,
      to return a\\nset of values which are associated only with the SMILES string
      and not\\nany individual conformation. (Matt Sigman does this, as does Bobby
      Paton\\n[for NMR prediction.](https://nova.chem.colostate.edu/cascade/predict/))\\nThis
      is a lot of work, though.\\n\\n## **\\\"A Gulf Of Mutual Incomprehension\\\"**\\n\\nThese
      differences also become apparent when comparing the software\\npackages that
      different tribes use. Take, for instance, the task of\\npredicting partial charges
      for a given small molecule. A QM-tribe\\nscientist would expect these charges
      to be a function of the geometry,\\nwhereas an MD-tribe scientist would want
      the results to be explicitly\\ngeometry-independent\\n([e.g.](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(22)01326-1))\\nso
      that they can be used for subsequent MD simulations.\\n\\nThe assumptions implicit
      to these worldviews mean that it's often quite\\ndifficult to go from QM-tribe
      software packages to MD-tribe software\\npackages or vice versa. I've been\\n[stymied](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/611)\\nbefore
      by trying to get OpenMM and openforcefield to work on organic\\nmolecules for
      which I had a list of coordinates and not e.g. a SMILES\\nstring---although
      obviously coordinates will at some point be needed in\\nthe MD simulation, most
      workflows expect you to start from a topology\\nand not an xyz file.\\n\\nSimilarly,
      it's [very\\ndifficult](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview/issues/589#issuecomment-468339971)\\nto
      get the graphics package NGLView to illustrate the process of bonds\\nbreaking
      and forming---NGLView is typically used for MD, and expects\\nthat the system's
      topology will be defined at the start of the\\nsimulation and never changed.
      (There are kludgy workarounds, like\\ndefining a new object for every frame,
      but it's nevertheless true that\\nNGLView is not made for QM-tribe people.)\\n\\n(I'm
      sure that MD-tribe people are very frustrated by QM software as\\nwell, but
      I don't have as much experience going in this direction. In\\ngeneral, MD tooling
      seems quite a bit more advanced than QM-tribe\\ntooling; most MD people I've
      talked to seem to interact with QM software\\nas little as possible, and I can't
      say I blame them.)\\n\\n## **\\\"A Curious Distorted Image of Each Other\\\"**\\n\\nThere
      are also cultural factors to consider here. The questions that\\nQM-tribe scientists
      think about are different than those that MD-tribe\\nscientists think about:
      a somewhat famous QM expert once told me that\\nthey were \\\"stuck on an ivory
      tower where people hold their nose when it\\ncomes to DFT, forget anything more
      approximate,\\\" whereas MD-tribe\\nscientists often seem alarmingly unconcerned
      about forcefield error but\\nare obsessed with proper sampling and simulation
      convergence.\\n\\nIt seems that most people have only a vague sense of what
      their\\ncongeners in the other tribe actually work on. I don't think most\\nQM-tribe
      scientists I know have ever run or analyzed a regular molecular\\ndynamics simulation
      using e.g. AMBER or OpenMM, nor do I expect that\\nmost MD-tribe scientists
      have tried to find a transition state in\\nGaussian or ORCA. In theory, coursework
      could remedy this, but education\\nfor QM alone already seems chaotic and ad
      hoc---trying to cram in MD,\\nstatistical mechanics, etc is probably ill-advised
      at the present.\\n\\nSocial considerations also play a role. There's limited
      crosstalk\\nbetween the two fields, especially at the trainee level. How many
      QM\\npeople even know who Prayush Tiwary is, or Michael Shirts, or Jay\\nPonder?
      How many MD graduate students have heard of Frank Neese or Troy\\nVan Voorhis?
      As always, generational talent manages to transcend narrow\\nboundaries---but
      rank-and-file scientists would benefit immensely from\\nincreased contact with
      the other tribe.\\n\\n## **\\\"Unite Them\\\"**\\n\\nI'm not an expert on the
      history of chemistry, but my understanding is\\nthat the two fields were not
      always so different: Martin Karplus, Arieh\\nWarshel, and Bill Jorgensen, key
      figures in the development of modern\\nMD, were also formidable quantum chemists.
      (If any famous chemists who\\nread this blog care to share their thoughts on
      this history, please\\nemail me: you know who you are!)\\n\\nAnd as the two
      fields advance, I think they will come closer together\\nonce more. As QM becomes
      capable of tackling larger and larger systems,\\nQM-tribe scientists will be
      forced to deal with more and more\\ncomplicated conformational landscapes: modern
      enantioselective catalysts\\nroutinely have hundreds of ground-state complexes
      to consider\\n([ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/sc/d2sc02274e)),\\nand
      QSimulate and Amgen recently reported full DFT calculations on\\nprotein--ligand
      complexes\\n([ref](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/345075772.pdf)).\\n\\nSimilarly,
      the increase in computing power means that many MD use cases\\n(like FEP) are
      now limited not by insufficient sampling but by the poor\\nenergetics of the
      forcefields they employ. This is difficult to prove\\nunequivocally, but I've
      heard this in interviews with industry folks,\\nand there are certainly plenty
      of references complaining about poor\\nforcefield accuracy\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00801),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01081)):
      a Psivant\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00564) dryly
      notes\\nthat \\\"historically solvation energy errors on the order of 2--3 kcal/mol\\nhave
      been considered to be accurate,\\\" which is hardly encouraging.\\n\\nMany QM-tribe
      professors now work on dynamics: Dean Tantillo and Todd\\nMartinez (who have
      long been voices \\\"crying out in the wilderness\\\" for\\ndynamics) perhaps
      most prominently, but also Steven Lopez, Daniel Ess,\\nFernanda Duarte, Peng
      Liu, etc. And MD-tribe professors seem more and\\nmore interested in using ML
      mimics of QM to replace forcefields\\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227959v1)),\\nwhich
      will inevitably lead them down the speed--accuracy rabbit hole\\nthat is quantum
      chemistry. So it seems likely to me that the two fields\\nwill increasingly
      reunite, and that being a good 21st-century\\ncomputational chemist will require
      competency in both areas.\\n\\nIf this is true, the conclusions for individual
      computational chemists\\nare obvious: learn techniques outside your specialty,
      before you get\\nforcibly dragged along by the current of scientific progress!
      There's\\nplenty to learn from the other culture of people that deals with\\nmore-or-less
      the same scientific problems you do, and no reason to wait.\\n\\n*As a denizen
      of quantum chemistry myself, I apologize for any\\nmisrepresentations or harmful

      out without\\nassistance (and it's not uncommon for bonds to change in a QM
      simulation\\nanyway).\\n\\nIn contrast, people in the MD tribe generally want
      a molecular\\nrepresentation that's independent of conformation, since many
      different\\nconformations will intrinsically be considered. (See Connor Coley's\\n[presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMZ8GHvvJv_jhy8t6fH73wv4e9ZjHwUN/view)\\nfrom
      a recent MolSSI workshop for a discussion of this.) Thus, it's\\ncommon to represent
      molecules through their topology, where connectivity\\nand bond order are explicitly
      specified. This allows for some pretty\\nwild [simulations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00241a001)
      of\\nspecies that would be reactive in a QM simulation, but also means that\\ne.g.
      tautomers can be a massive problem in MD\\n([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9920-5)),\\nsince
      protons can't equilibrate freely.\\n\\nFor property prediction, an uneasy compromise
      can be reached wherein one\\ntakes a SMILES string, performs a conformational
      search, and then\\nBoltzmann-averages properties over all different conformers,
      to return a\\nset of values which are associated only with the SMILES string
      and not\\nany individual conformation. (Matt Sigman does this, as does Bobby
      Paton\\n[for NMR prediction.](https://nova.chem.colostate.edu/cascade/predict/))\\nThis
      is a lot of work, though.\\n\\n## **\\\"A Gulf Of Mutual Incomprehension\\\"**\\n\\nThese
      differences also become apparent when comparing the software\\npackages that
      different tribes use. Take, for instance, the task of\\npredicting partial charges
      for a given small molecule. A QM-tribe\\nscientist would expect these charges
      to be a function of the geometry,\\nwhereas an MD-tribe scientist would want
      the results to be explicitly\\ngeometry-independent\\n([e.g.](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(22)01326-1))\\nso
      that they can be used for subsequent MD simulations.\\n\\nThe assumptions implicit
      to these worldviews mean that it's often quite\\ndifficult to go from QM-tribe
      software packages to MD-tribe software\\npackages or vice versa. I've been\\n[stymied](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/611)\\nbefore
      by trying to get OpenMM and openforcefield to work on organic\\nmolecules for
      which I had a list of coordinates and not e.g. a SMILES\\nstring---although
      obviously coordinates will at some point be needed in\\nthe MD simulation, most
      workflows expect you to start from a topology\\nand not an xyz file.\\n\\nSimilarly,
      it's [very\\ndifficult](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview/issues/589#issuecomment-468339971)\\nto
      get the graphics package NGLView to illustrate the process of bonds\\nbreaking
      and forming---NGLView is typically used for MD, and expects\\nthat the system's
      topology will be defined at the start of the\\nsimulation and never changed.
      (There are kludgy workarounds, like\\ndefining a new object for every frame,
      but it's nevertheless true that\\nNGLView is not made for QM-tribe people.)\\n\\n(I'm
      sure that MD-tribe people are very frustrated by QM software as\\nwell, but
      I don't have as much experience going in this direction. In\\ngeneral, MD tooling
      seems quite a bit more advanced than QM-tribe\\ntooling; most MD people I've
      talked to seem to interact with QM software\\nas little as possible, and I can't
      say I blame them.)\\n\\n## **\\\"A Curious Distorted Image of Each Other\\\"**\\n\\nThere
      are also cultural factors to consider here. The questions that\\nQM-tribe scientists
      think about are different than those that MD-tribe\\nscientists think about:
      a somewhat famous QM expert once told me that\\nthey were \\\"stuck on an ivory
      tower where people hold their nose when it\\ncomes to DFT, forget anything more
      approximate,\\\" whereas MD-tribe\\nscientists often seem alarmingly unconcerned
      about forcefield error but\\nare obsessed with proper sampling and simulation
      convergence.\\n\\nIt seems that most people have only a vague sense of what
      their\\ncongeners in the other tribe actually work on. I don't think most\\nQM-tribe
      scientists I know have ever run or analyzed a regular molecular\\ndynamics simulation
      using e.g. AMBER or OpenMM, nor do I expect that\\nmost MD-tribe scientists
      have tried to find a transition state in\\nGaussian or ORCA. In theory, coursework
      could remedy this, but education\\nfor QM alone already seems chaotic and ad
      hoc---trying to cram in MD,\\nstatistical mechanics, etc is probably ill-advised
      at the present.\\n\\nSocial considerations also play a role. There's limited
      crosstalk\\nbetween the two fields, especially at the trainee level. How many
      QM\\npeople even know who Prayush Tiwary is, or Michael Shirts, or Jay\\nPonder?
      How many MD graduate students have heard of Frank Neese or Troy\\nVan Voorhis?
      As always, generational talent manages to transcend narrow\\nboundaries---but
      rank-and-file scientists would benefit immensely from\\nincreased contact with
      the other tribe.\\n\\n## **\\\"Unite Them\\\"**\\n\\nI'm not an expert on the
      history of chemistry, but my understanding is\\nthat the two fields were not
      always so different: Martin Karplus, Arieh\\nWarshel, and Bill Jorgensen, key
      figures in the development of modern\\nMD, were also formidable quantum chemists.
      (If any famous chemists who\\nread this blog care to share their thoughts on
      this history, please\\nemail me: you know who you are!)\\n\\nAnd as the two
      fields advance, I think they will come closer together\\nonce more. As QM becomes
      capable of tackling larger and larger systems,\\nQM-tribe scientists will be
      forced to deal with more and more\\ncomplicated conformational landscapes: modern
      enantioselective catalysts\\nroutinely have hundreds of ground-state complexes
      to consider\\n([ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/sc/d2sc02274e)),\\nand
      QSimulate and Amgen recently reported full DFT calculations on\\nprotein--ligand
      complexes\\n([ref](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/345075772.pdf)).\\n\\nSimilarly,
      the increase in computing power means that many MD use cases\\n(like FEP) are
      now limited not by insufficient sampling but by the poor\\nenergetics of the
      forcefields they employ. This is difficult to prove\\nunequivocally, but I've
      heard this in interviews with industry folks,\\nand there are certainly plenty
      of references complaining about poor\\nforcefield accuracy\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00801),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01081)):
      a Psivant\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00564) dryly
      notes\\nthat \\\"historically solvation energy errors on the order of 2--3 kcal/mol\\nhave
      been considered to be accurate,\\\" which is hardly encouraging.\\n\\nMany QM-tribe
      professors now work on dynamics: Dean Tantillo and Todd\\nMartinez (who have
      long been voices \\\"crying out in the wilderness\\\" for\\ndynamics) perhaps
      most prominently, but also Steven Lopez, Daniel Ess,\\nFernanda Duarte, Peng
      Liu, etc. And MD-tribe professors seem more and\\nmore interested in using ML
      mimics of QM to replace forcefields\\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227959v1)),\\nwhich
      will inevitably lead them down the speed--accuracy rabbit hole\\nthat is quantum
      chemistry. So it seems likely to me that the two fields\\nwill increasingly
      reunite, and that being a good 21st-century\\ncomputational chemist will require
      competency in both areas.\\n\\nIf this is true, the conclusions for individual
      computational chemists\\nare obvious: learn techniques outside your specialty,
      before you get\\nforcibly dragged along by the current of scientific progress!
      There's\\nplenty to learn from the other culture of people that deals with\\nmore-or-less
      the same scientific problems you do, and no reason to wait.\\n\\n*As a denizen
      of quantum chemistry myself, I apologize for any\\nmisrepresentations or harmful
      stereotypes about practitioners of\\nmolecular dynamics, for whom I have only
      love and respect. I would be\\nhappy to hear any corrections over email.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"135528878\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      problem with simulating chemical reactions is that\nreactions generally take
      place in solvent, but most simulations are run\nwithout solvent molecules. This
      is a big deal, since much of the\ninaccuracy associated with simulation actually
      stems from poor treatment\nof solvation: when gas phase experimental data is
      compared to\ncomputations, the results are often quite good.\n\nWhy don''t computational
      chemists include solvent molecules in their\nmodels? It takes a lot of solvent
      molecules to accurately mimic bulk\nsolvent (enough to cover the system with
      a few different layers, usually\n\\~10^3^).^1^ Since most quantum chemical methods
      scale in practice as\n*O*(N^2^)--*O*(N^3^), adding hundreds of additional atoms
      has a\ncatastrophic effect on the speed of the simulation.\n\nTo make matters
      worse, the additional degrees of freedom introduced by\nthe solvent molecules
      are very \"flat\"---solvent molecules don''t usually\nhave well-defined positions
      about the substrate, meaning that the number\nof energetically accessible conformations
      goes to infinity (with\nattendant consequences for entropy). This necessitates
      a fundamental\nchange in how calculations are performed: instead of finding\nwell-defined
      extrema on the electronic potential energy surface (ground\nstates or transition
      states), molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo\nsimulations must be used to
      sample from an underlying distribution of\nstructures and reconstruct the free
      energy surface. Sufficient sampling\nusually requires consideration of 10^4^--10^6^
      individual structures,^2^\nmeaning that each individual computation must be
      very fast (which is\nchallenging for quantum chemical methods).\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5620dfe9-0ccc-4d58-87f5-09edc0c80a5b_2140x826.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      it''s not surprising that most\ncomputational organic chemists try to avoid
      explicit solvent at all\ncosts. The typical workaround is to use \"implicit
      solvent\" models, which\n\"reduce the complexity of individual solvent\u2212solute
      interactions such as\nhydrogen-bond, dipole\u2212dipole, and van der Waals interactions
      into a\nfictitious surface potential\\... scaled to reproduce the experimental\nsolvation
      free energies\"\n([Baik](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00456?src=recsys)).\nThis
      preserves the well-defined potential energy surfaces that organic\nchemists
      are accustomed to, so you can still find transition states by\neigenvector following,
      etc.\n\nImplicit solvent models like PCM, COSMO, or SMD are better than nothing,\nbut
      are known to struggle for charged species. In particular, they don''t\nreally
      describe explicit inner-sphere solvent--solute interactions (like\nhydrogen
      bonding), meaning that they''ll behave poorly when these\ninteractions are important.
      Dan Singleton''s paper on [the\nBaylis--Hillman reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      is\na nice case study of how badly implicit solvent can fail: even\nhigh-level
      quantum chemical methods are useless when solvation free\nenergies are 10 kcal/mol
      off from experiment!\n\nThis issue is well-known. To quote from [Schreiner and\nGrimme](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201709943):\n\n>
      An even more important but still open issue is solvation. In the\n> opinion
      of the authors it is a ''scandal'' that in 2018 no routine free\n> energy solvation
      method is available beyond (moderately successful)\n> continuum theories such
      as COSMO-RS and SMD and classical FF/MD-based\n> explicit treatments.\n\nWhen
      computational studies have been performed in explicit solvent, the\nresults
      have often been promising: Singleton has studied [diene\nhydrochlorination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.0c06295)\nand
      [nitration of\ntoluene](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b07328), and
      Peng Liu\nhas recently conducted a nice [study of chemical\nglycosylation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c12096).\nNevertheless,
      these studies all require heroic levels of effort: quantum\nchemistry is still
      very slow, and so a single free energy surface might\ntake months and months
      to compute.^3^\n\nOne promising workaround is using machine learning to accelerate
      quantum\nchemistry. Since these MD-type studies look at the same exact system\nover
      and over again, we could imagine first training some sort of ML\nmodel based
      on high-level quantum chemistry data, and then employing\nthis model over and
      over again for the actual MD run. As long as (1) the\nML model is faster than
      the QM method used to train it and (2) it takes\nless data to train the ML model
      than it would to run the simulation,\nthis will save time: in most cases, a
      lot of time.\n\n(This is a somewhat different use case than e.g.\n[ANI](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c6sc05720a)-type\nmodels,
      which aim to achieve decent accuracy for any organic molecule.\nHere, we already
      know what system we want to study, and we''re willing to\ndo some training up
      front.)\n\nA lot of people are working in this field right now, but today I
      want to\nhighlight some work that I liked from Fernanda Duarte and co-workers.\nLast
      year, they published a\n[paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d2cp02978b#cit23)\ncomparing
      a few different ML methods for studying quasiclassical\ndynamics (in the gas
      phase), and found that atomic cluster expansion\n(ACE) performed better than
      Gaussian approximation potentials while\ntraining faster than NequIP. They then
      went on to show that ACE models\ncould be trained automatically through active
      learning, and used the\nmodels to successfully predict product ratios for cycloadditions
      with\npost-TS bifurcations.\n\nTheir new\n[paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a8085fba3e99daefab8f89),\nposted
      on ChemRxiv yesterday, applies the same ACE/active learning\napproach to studying
      reactions in explicit solvent, with the reaction of\ncyclopentadiene and methyl
      vinyl ketone chosen as a model system. This\nis more challenging than their
      previous work, because the ML model now\nnot only has to recapitulate the solute
      reactivity but also the\nsolute--solvent and solvent--solvent interactions.
      To try and capture\nall the different interactions efficiently, the authors
      ended up using\nfour different sets of training data: substrates only, substrates
      with 2\nsolvent molecules, substrates with 33 solvent molecules, and clusters
      of\nsolvent only.\n\nPreviously, the authors used an energy-based selector to
      determine if a\nstructure should be added to the training set: they predicted
      the energy\nwith the model, ran a QM calculation, and selected the structure
      if the\ndifference between the two values was big enough. This approach makes
      a\nlot of sense, but has the unfortunate downside that a lot of QM\ncalculations
      are needed, which is exactly what this ML-based approach is\ntrying to avoid.
      Here, the authors found that they could use\nsimilarity-based descriptors to
      select data points to add to the\ntraining set: these descriptors are both more
      efficient (needing fewer\nstructures to converge) and faster to compute, making
      them overall a\nmuch better choice. (This approach is reminiscent of the\nmetadynamics-based
      approach previously\n[reported](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07240) by John Parkhill
      and\nco-workers.)\n\nWith a properly trained model in hand, the authors went
      on to study the\nreaction with biased sampling MD. They find that the reaction
      is indeed\naccelerated in explicit water, and that the free energy surface begins\nto
      look stepwise, as opposed to the concerted mechanism predicted in\nimplicit
      solvent. (Singleton has observed similar behavior\n[before](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja208779k),
      and [I''ve seen\nthis\ntoo.](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6362b49531107263acfa50e6))\nThey
      do some other interesting studies: they look at the difference\nbetween methanol
      and water as solvents, argue that Houk is wrong about\nthe role of water in
      the TS,^4^ and suggest that the hydrophobic effect\ndrives solvent-induced rate

      they find for this particular system are interesting, but\nmore exciting is
      the promise that these techniques may soon become\naccessible to \"regular\"
      computational chemists. Duarte and co-workers\nhave shown that ML can be used
      to solve an age-old problem in chemical\nsimulation; if explicit solvent ML/MD
      simulations of organic reactions\nbecome easy enough for non-experts to run,
      I have no doubt that they\nwill become a valued and essential part of the physical
      organic\nchemistry toolbox. Much work is needed to get to that point---new\nsoftware
      packages, further validation on new systems, new ways to assess\nquality and
      check robustness of simulations, and much more---but the\nvision behind this
      paper is powerful, and I can''t wait until it comes to\nfruition.\n\n*Thanks
      to Croix Laconsay for reading a draft of this post.*\n\n### **Footnotes**\n\n1.  [This
      video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caxpxBT8JsM) from Chris\n    Cramer makes
      the point nicely.\n\n2.  This obviously depends on the system in question, and
      what processes\n    are being studied. But in general insufficient sampling
      is a big\n    issue in molecular dynamics, which I think is underappreciated
      by\n    organic chemists wading into the area. Jeff Grossman has a [nice\n    paper
      on\n    this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00833).\n\n3.  If
      you look carefully, many people who claim to be doing big *ab\n    initio* molecular
      dynamics studies are actually doing semiempirical\n    molecular dynamics. This
      isn''t dishonest per se, but it''s a little\n    underwhelming to a computational
      chemist, especially when it''s only\n    mentioned in the SI. Things get even
      more confusing when plane wave\n    DFT is employed: in theory, plane wave DFT
      can be just as accurate\n    as regular DFT, but in practice there are some
      sneaky approximations\n    that often get introduced.\n\n4.  This argument hinges
      on whether uphill dynamics (starting from\n    reactants, going to transition
      state) or downhill dynamics (starting\n    from transition state, going to reactants)
      are more appropriate. The\n    authors argue that \\\"uphill dynamics allow
      the solvent sufficient\n    time to reorganise \\[*sic*\\] before the trajectory
      passes the free\n    energy barrier, providing a more realistic view of solvent
      behaviour\n    \\[*sic*\\] during the reaction.\\\" I\\''m not fully convinced
      by\n    this---isn\\''t the idea that the system reorganizes to minimize the\n    energy
      of the transition state a basic precept of transition state\n    theory? But
      I\\''m not convinced I understand these issues deeply\n    enough to have an
      opinion; I will leave this to the experts.\n\n5.  This argument hearkens back
      to some old-school computational organic\n    chemistry I love from Bill Jorgensen,
      studying the [hydrophobic\n    effect on conformational preferences of\n    butane](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/77/11/5757/783263/Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-n-butane-in-water?redirectedFrom=fulltext).\n    We
      usually think of the hydrophobic effect as associated with\n    macromolecules
      (ligands binding to proteins, etc), but it can still\n    matter in tiny systems!\n",

      paper makes me so sad, because these\\ntechniques are still ignored by most
      organic chemists.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nGiven the complexity
      this introduces, it's not surprising that most\\ncomputational organic chemists
      try to avoid explicit solvent at all\\ncosts. The typical workaround is to use
      \\\"implicit solvent\\\" models, which\\n\\\"reduce the complexity of individual
      solvent\u2212solute interactions such as\\nhydrogen-bond, dipole\u2212dipole,
      and van der Waals interactions into a\\nfictitious surface potential\\\\...
      scaled to reproduce the experimental\\nsolvation free energies\\\"\\n([Baik](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00456?src=recsys)).\\nThis
      preserves the well-defined potential energy surfaces that organic\\nchemists
      are accustomed to, so you can still find transition states by\\neigenvector
      following, etc.\\n\\nImplicit solvent models like PCM, COSMO, or SMD are better
      than nothing,\\nbut are known to struggle for charged species. In particular,
      they don't\\nreally describe explicit inner-sphere solvent--solute interactions
      (like\\nhydrogen bonding), meaning that they'll behave poorly when these\\ninteractions
      are important. Dan Singleton's paper on [the\\nBaylis--Hillman reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      is\\na nice case study of how badly implicit solvent can fail: even\\nhigh-level
      quantum chemical methods are useless when solvation free\\nenergies are 10 kcal/mol
      off from experiment!\\n\\nThis issue is well-known. To quote from [Schreiner
      and\\nGrimme](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201709943):\\n\\n>
      An even more important but still open issue is solvation. In the\\n> opinion
      of the authors it is a 'scandal' that in 2018 no routine free\\n> energy solvation
      method is available beyond (moderately successful)\\n> continuum theories such
      as COSMO-RS and SMD and classical FF/MD-based\\n> explicit treatments.\\n\\nWhen
      computational studies have been performed in explicit solvent, the\\nresults
      have often been promising: Singleton has studied [diene\\nhydrochlorination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.0c06295)\\nand
      [nitration of\\ntoluene](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b07328), and
      Peng Liu\\nhas recently conducted a nice [study of chemical\\nglycosylation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c12096).\\nNevertheless,
      these studies all require heroic levels of effort: quantum\\nchemistry is still
      very slow, and so a single free energy surface might\\ntake months and months
      to compute.^3^\\n\\nOne promising workaround is using machine learning to accelerate
      quantum\\nchemistry. Since these MD-type studies look at the same exact system\\nover
      and over again, we could imagine first training some sort of ML\\nmodel based
      on high-level quantum chemistry data, and then employing\\nthis model over and
      over again for the actual MD run. As long as (1) the\\nML model is faster than
      the QM method used to train it and (2) it takes\\nless data to train the ML
      model than it would to run the simulation,\\nthis will save time: in most cases,
      a lot of time.\\n\\n(This is a somewhat different use case than e.g.\\n[ANI](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c6sc05720a)-type\\nmodels,
      which aim to achieve decent accuracy for any organic molecule.\\nHere, we already
      know what system we want to study, and we're willing to\\ndo some training up
      front.)\\n\\nA lot of people are working in this field right now, but today
      I want to\\nhighlight some work that I liked from Fernanda Duarte and co-workers.\\nLast
      year, they published a\\n[paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d2cp02978b#cit23)\\ncomparing
      a few different ML methods for studying quasiclassical\\ndynamics (in the gas
      phase), and found that atomic cluster expansion\\n(ACE) performed better than
      Gaussian approximation potentials while\\ntraining faster than NequIP. They
      then went on to show that ACE models\\ncould be trained automatically through
      active learning, and used the\\nmodels to successfully predict product ratios
      for cycloadditions with\\npost-TS bifurcations.\\n\\nTheir new\\n[paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a8085fba3e99daefab8f89),\\nposted
      on ChemRxiv yesterday, applies the same ACE/active learning\\napproach to studying
      reactions in explicit solvent, with the reaction of\\ncyclopentadiene and methyl
      vinyl ketone chosen as a model system. This\\nis more challenging than their
      previous work, because the ML model now\\nnot only has to recapitulate the solute
      reactivity but also the\\nsolute--solvent and solvent--solvent interactions.
      To try and capture\\nall the different interactions efficiently, the authors
      ended up using\\nfour different sets of training data: substrates only, substrates
      with 2\\nsolvent molecules, substrates with 33 solvent molecules, and clusters
      of\\nsolvent only.\\n\\nPreviously, the authors used an energy-based selector
      to determine if a\\nstructure should be added to the training set: they predicted
      the energy\\nwith the model, ran a QM calculation, and selected the structure
      if the\\ndifference between the two values was big enough. This approach makes
      a\\nlot of sense, but has the unfortunate downside that a lot of QM\\ncalculations
      are needed, which is exactly what this ML-based approach is\\ntrying to avoid.
      Here, the authors found that they could use\\nsimilarity-based descriptors to
      select data points to add to the\\ntraining set: these descriptors are both
      more efficient (needing fewer\\nstructures to converge) and faster to compute,
      making them overall a\\nmuch better choice. (This approach is reminiscent of
      the\\nmetadynamics-based approach previously\\n[reported](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07240)
      by John Parkhill and\\nco-workers.)\\n\\nWith a properly trained model in hand,
      the authors went on to study the\\nreaction with biased sampling MD. They find
      that the reaction is indeed\\naccelerated in explicit water, and that the free
      energy surface begins\\nto look stepwise, as opposed to the concerted mechanism
      predicted in\\nimplicit solvent. (Singleton has observed similar behavior\\n[before](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja208779k),
      and [I've seen\\nthis\\ntoo.](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6362b49531107263acfa50e6))\\nThey
      do some other interesting studies: they look at the difference\\nbetween methanol
      and water as solvents, argue that Houk is wrong about\\nthe role of water in
      the TS,^4^ and suggest that the hydrophobic effect\\ndrives solvent-induced
      rate acceleration.^5^\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6975e447-caac-4e1b-a7bd-1d398c0e7954_1086x992.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      \ [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caxpxBT8JsM) from Chris\\n    Cramer
      makes the point nicely.\\n\\n2.  This obviously depends on the system in question,
      and what processes\\n    are being studied. But in general insufficient sampling
      is a big\\n    issue in molecular dynamics, which I think is underappreciated
      by\\n    organic chemists wading into the area. Jeff Grossman has a [nice\\n
      \   paper on\\n    this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00833).\\n\\n3.
      \ If you look carefully, many people who claim to be doing big *ab\\n    initio*
      molecular dynamics studies are actually doing semiempirical\\n    molecular
      dynamics. This isn't dishonest per se, but it's a little\\n    underwhelming
      to a computational chemist, especially when it's only\\n    mentioned in the
      SI. Things get even more confusing when plane wave\\n    DFT is employed: in
      theory, plane wave DFT can be just as accurate\\n    as regular DFT, but in
      practice there are some sneaky approximations\\n    that often get introduced.\\n\\n4.
      \ This argument hinges on whether uphill dynamics (starting from\\n    reactants,
      going to transition state) or downhill dynamics (starting\\n    from transition
      state, going to reactants) are more appropriate. The\\n    authors argue that
      \\\\\\\"uphill dynamics allow the solvent sufficient\\n    time to reorganise
      \\\\[*sic*\\\\] before the trajectory passes the free\\n    energy barrier,
      providing a more realistic view of solvent behaviour\\n    \\\\[*sic*\\\\] during
      the reaction.\\\\\\\" I\\\\'m not fully convinced by\\n    this---isn\\\\'t
      the idea that the system reorganizes to minimize the\\n    energy of the transition
      state a basic precept of transition state\\n    theory? But I\\\\'m not convinced
      I understand these issues deeply\\n    enough to have an opinion; I will leave
      this to the experts.\\n\\n5.  This argument hearkens back to some old-school
      computational organic\\n    chemistry I love from Bill Jorgensen, studying the
      [hydrophobic\\n    effect on conformational preferences of\\n    butane](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/77/11/5757/783263/Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-n-butane-in-water?redirectedFrom=fulltext).\\n
      \   We usually think of the hydrophobic effect as associated with\\n    macromolecules
      (ligands binding to proteins, etc), but it can still\\n    matter in tiny systems!\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"135301533\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      important problem with simulating chemical reactions is that\\nreactions generally
      take place in solvent, but most simulations are run\\nwithout solvent molecules.
      This is a big deal, since much of the\\ninaccuracy associated with simulation
      actually stems from poor treatment\\nof solvation: when gas phase experimental
      data is compared to\\ncomputations, the results are often quite good.\\n\\nWhy
      don't computational chemists include solvent molecules in their\\nmodels? It
      takes a lot of solvent molecules to accurately mimic bulk\\nsolvent (enough
      to cover the system with a few different layers, usually\\n\\\\~10^3^).^1^ Since
      most quantum chemical methods scale in practice as\\n*O*(N^2^)--*O*(N^3^), adding
      hundreds of additional atoms has a\\ncatastrophic effect on the speed of the
      simulation.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the additional degrees of freedom introduced
      by\\nthe solvent molecules are very \\\"flat\\\"---solvent molecules don't usually\\nhave
      well-defined positions about the substrate, meaning that the number\\nof energetically
      accessible conformations goes to infinity (with\\nattendant consequences for
      entropy). This necessitates a fundamental\\nchange in how calculations are performed:
      instead of finding\\nwell-defined extrema on the electronic potential energy
      surface (ground\\nstates or transition states), molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte
      Carlo\\nsimulations must be used to sample from an underlying distribution of\\nstructures
      and reconstruct the free energy surface. Sufficient sampling\\nusually requires
      consideration of 10^4^--10^6^ individual structures,^2^\\nmeaning that each
      individual computation must be very fast (which is\\nchallenging for quantum
      chemical methods).\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5620dfe9-0ccc-4d58-87f5-09edc0c80a5b_2140x826.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      this introduces, it's not surprising that most\\ncomputational organic chemists
      try to avoid explicit solvent at all\\ncosts. The typical workaround is to use
      \\\"implicit solvent\\\" models, which\\n\\\"reduce the complexity of individual
      solvent\u2212solute interactions such as\\nhydrogen-bond, dipole\u2212dipole,
      and van der Waals interactions into a\\nfictitious surface potential\\\\...
      scaled to reproduce the experimental\\nsolvation free energies\\\"\\n([Baik](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00456?src=recsys)).\\nThis
      preserves the well-defined potential energy surfaces that organic\\nchemists
      are accustomed to, so you can still find transition states by\\neigenvector
      following, etc.\\n\\nImplicit solvent models like PCM, COSMO, or SMD are better
      than nothing,\\nbut are known to struggle for charged species. In particular,
      they don't\\nreally describe explicit inner-sphere solvent--solute interactions
      (like\\nhydrogen bonding), meaning that they'll behave poorly when these\\ninteractions
      are important. Dan Singleton's paper on [the\\nBaylis--Hillman reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      is\\na nice case study of how badly implicit solvent can fail: even\\nhigh-level
      quantum chemical methods are useless when solvation free\\nenergies are 10 kcal/mol
      off from experiment!\\n\\nThis issue is well-known. To quote from [Schreiner
      and\\nGrimme](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201709943):\\n\\n>
      An even more important but still open issue is solvation. In the\\n> opinion
      of the authors it is a 'scandal' that in 2018 no routine free\\n> energy solvation
      method is available beyond (moderately successful)\\n> continuum theories such
      as COSMO-RS and SMD and classical FF/MD-based\\n> explicit treatments.\\n\\nWhen
      computational studies have been performed in explicit solvent, the\\nresults
      have often been promising: Singleton has studied [diene\\nhydrochlorination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.0c06295)\\nand
      [nitration of\\ntoluene](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b07328), and
      Peng Liu\\nhas recently conducted a nice [study of chemical\\nglycosylation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c12096).\\nNevertheless,
      these studies all require heroic levels of effort: quantum\\nchemistry is still
      very slow, and so a single free energy surface might\\ntake months and months
      to compute.^3^\\n\\nOne promising workaround is using machine learning to accelerate
      quantum\\nchemistry. Since these MD-type studies look at the same exact system\\nover
      and over again, we could imagine first training some sort of ML\\nmodel based
      on high-level quantum chemistry data, and then employing\\nthis model over and
      over again for the actual MD run. As long as (1) the\\nML model is faster than
      the QM method used to train it and (2) it takes\\nless data to train the ML
      model than it would to run the simulation,\\nthis will save time: in most cases,
      a lot of time.\\n\\n(This is a somewhat different use case than e.g.\\n[ANI](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c6sc05720a)-type\\nmodels,
      which aim to achieve decent accuracy for any organic molecule.\\nHere, we already
      know what system we want to study, and we're willing to\\ndo some training up
      front.)\\n\\nA lot of people are working in this field right now, but today
      I want to\\nhighlight some work that I liked from Fernanda Duarte and co-workers.\\nLast
      year, they published a\\n[paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d2cp02978b#cit23)\\ncomparing
      a few different ML methods for studying quasiclassical\\ndynamics (in the gas
      phase), and found that atomic cluster expansion\\n(ACE) performed better than
      Gaussian approximation potentials while\\ntraining faster than NequIP. They
      then went on to show that ACE models\\ncould be trained automatically through
      active learning, and used the\\nmodels to successfully predict product ratios
      for cycloadditions with\\npost-TS bifurcations.\\n\\nTheir new\\n[paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a8085fba3e99daefab8f89),\\nposted
      on ChemRxiv yesterday, applies the same ACE/active learning\\napproach to studying
      reactions in explicit solvent, with the reaction of\\ncyclopentadiene and methyl
      vinyl ketone chosen as a model system. This\\nis more challenging than their
      previous work, because the ML model now\\nnot only has to recapitulate the solute
      reactivity but also the\\nsolute--solvent and solvent--solvent interactions.
      To try and capture\\nall the different interactions efficiently, the authors
      ended up using\\nfour different sets of training data: substrates only, substrates
      with 2\\nsolvent molecules, substrates with 33 solvent molecules, and clusters
      of\\nsolvent only.\\n\\nPreviously, the authors used an energy-based selector
      to determine if a\\nstructure should be added to the training set: they predicted
      the energy\\nwith the model, ran a QM calculation, and selected the structure
      if the\\ndifference between the two values was big enough. This approach makes
      a\\nlot of sense, but has the unfortunate downside that a lot of QM\\ncalculations
      are needed, which is exactly what this ML-based approach is\\ntrying to avoid.
      Here, the authors found that they could use\\nsimilarity-based descriptors to
      select data points to add to the\\ntraining set: these descriptors are both
      more efficient (needing fewer\\nstructures to converge) and faster to compute,
      making them overall a\\nmuch better choice. (This approach is reminiscent of
      the\\nmetadynamics-based approach previously\\n[reported](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07240)
      by John Parkhill and\\nco-workers.)\\n\\nWith a properly trained model in hand,
      the authors went on to study the\\nreaction with biased sampling MD. They find
      that the reaction is indeed\\naccelerated in explicit water, and that the free
      energy surface begins\\nto look stepwise, as opposed to the concerted mechanism
      predicted in\\nimplicit solvent. (Singleton has observed similar behavior\\n[before](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja208779k),
      and [I've seen\\nthis\\ntoo.](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6362b49531107263acfa50e6))\\nThey
      do some other interesting studies: they look at the difference\\nbetween methanol
      and water as solvents, argue that Houk is wrong about\\nthe role of water in
      the TS,^4^ and suggest that the hydrophobic effect\\ndrives solvent-induced
      rate acceleration.^5^\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6975e447-caac-4e1b-a7bd-1d398c0e7954_1086x992.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      makes the point nicely.\\n\\n2.  This obviously depends on the system in question,
      and what processes\\n    are being studied. But in general insufficient sampling
      is a big\\n    issue in molecular dynamics, which I think is underappreciated
      by\\n    organic chemists wading into the area. Jeff Grossman has a [nice\\n
      \   paper on\\n    this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00833).\\n\\n3.
      \ If you look carefully, many people who claim to be doing big *ab\\n    initio*
      molecular dynamics studies are actually doing semiempirical\\n    molecular
      dynamics. This isn't dishonest per se, but it's a little\\n    underwhelming
      to a computational chemist, especially when it's only\\n    mentioned in the
      SI. Things get even more confusing when plane wave\\n    DFT is employed: in
      theory, plane wave DFT can be just as accurate\\n    as regular DFT, but in
      practice there are some sneaky approximations\\n    that often get introduced.\\n\\n4.
      \ This argument hinges on whether uphill dynamics (starting from\\n    reactants,
      going to transition state) or downhill dynamics (starting\\n    from transition
      state, going to reactants) are more appropriate. The\\n    authors argue that
      \\\\\\\"uphill dynamics allow the solvent sufficient\\n    time to reorganise
      \\\\[*sic*\\\\] before the trajectory passes the free\\n    energy barrier,
      providing a more realistic view of solvent behaviour\\n    \\\\[*sic*\\\\] during
      the reaction.\\\\\\\" I\\\\'m not fully convinced by\\n    this---isn\\\\'t
      the idea that the system reorganizes to minimize the\\n    energy of the transition
      state a basic precept of transition state\\n    theory? But I\\\\'m not convinced
      I understand these issues deeply\\n    enough to have an opinion; I will leave
      this to the experts.\\n\\n5.  This argument hearkens back to some old-school
      computational organic\\n    chemistry I love from Bill Jorgensen, studying the
      [hydrophobic\\n    effect on conformational preferences of\\n    butane](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/77/11/5757/783263/Monte-Carlo-simulation-of-n-butane-in-water?redirectedFrom=fulltext).\\n
      \   We usually think of the hydrophobic effect as associated with\\n    macromolecules
      (ligands binding to proteins, etc), but it can still\\n    matter in tiny systems!\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"135301533\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      most research is done by academic labs funded mainly by the\ngovernment. Many
      articles have been written on the shortcomings with\nacademic research: Sam
      Rodriques recently had a nice\n[post](https://www.sam-rodriques.com/post/academia-is-an-educational-institution)\nabout
      how academia is ultimately an educational institution, and how\nthis limits
      the quality of academic research. (It''s worth a read; I''ve\nwritten about
      these issues from a\n[few](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221026_structural_diversity.html)\n[angles](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230502_startups.html),\nand
      will probably write more at a later date.)\n\nThe major alternative to academic
      research that people put forward is\n[focused research\norganizations](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5)\n(FROs):
      large, non-profit research organizations capable of tackling big\nunsolved problems.
      These organizations, similar in scope and ambition to\ne.g. CERN or LIGO, are
      envisioned to operate with a budget of \\$20--100M\nover five years, making
      them substantially larger and more expensive\nthan a single academic lab. This
      model is still being tested, but it\nseems likely that some version of FROs
      will prove effective for\nappropriately sized problems.\n\nBut FROs have some
      disadvantages, too: they represent a significant\ninvestment on the part of
      funders, and so it''s important to choose\nprojects where there''s a high likelihood
      of impact in the given area.\n(In contrast, it''s expected that most new academic
      labs will focus on\nhigh-risk projects, and pivot if things don''t work out
      in a few years.)\nIn this piece, I propose a new form of scientific organization
      that\ncombines aspects of both FROs and academic labs: for-profit micro\nfocused
      research organizations (FP\u00b5FROs).\n\nThe key insight behind FP\u00b5FROs
      is that existing financial markets could\nbe used to fund scientific research
      when there is a realistic\npossibility for profit as a result of the research.
      This means that\nFP\u00b5FROs need not be funded by the government or philanthropic
      spending,\nbut could instead raise capital from e.g. venture capitalists or
      angel\ninvestors, who have access to substantially more money and are used to\nmaking
      high-risk, high-reward investments.\n\nFP\u00b5FROs would also be smaller and
      more nimble than full-fledged FROs,\nable to tackle high-risk problems just
      like academia. But unlike\nacademic labs, FP\u00b5FROs would be able to spend
      more freely and hire more\naggressively, thus circumventing the human capital
      issues that plague\nacademic research. While most academic labs are staffed
      entirely with\ninexperienced trainees (as Rodriques notes above), FP\u00b5FROs
      could hire\nexperienced scientists, engineers, and programmers, thus accelerating\nthe
      rate of scientific progress.\n\nOne limitation of the FP\u00b5FRO model is that
      research would need to be\nprofitable within a reasonable time frame. But this
      limitation might\nactually be a blessing in disguise: the need for profitability
      means\nthat FP\u00b5FROs would be incentivized to provide real value to firms,
      thus\npreventing useless research through the magic of Adam Smith''s invisible\nhand.\n\nAnother
      disadvantage of FP\u00b5FROs is that they must be able to achieve\nsuccess with
      relatively little funding (probably around \\$10M; big for\nacademia, but small
      compared to a FRO). This means that their projects\nwould have to be modest
      in scope. I think this is probably a blessing in\ndisguise, though. Consider
      the following advice [from Paul\nGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html):\n\n>
      Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with\n> deceptively
      small things.... Maybe it\\''s a bad idea to have really big\n> ambitions initially,
      because the bigger your ambition, the longer\n> it\\''s going to take, and the
      further you project into the future, the\n> more likely you\\''ll get it wrong.\n\nThus,
      the need for FP\u00b5FROs to focus on getting a single \"minimal viable\nproduct\"
      right might be very helpful, and could even lead to more\nimpactful firms later
      on.\n\nIn conclusion, FP\u00b5FROs could combine the best qualities of academic
      labs\nand FROs: they would be agile and risk-tolerant, like academic labs, but\nproperly
      incentivized to produce useful research instead of publishing\npapers, like
      FROs. This novel model should be investigated further as a\nmechanism for generating
      new scientific discoveries at scale with\nimmediate short-term utility.\n\n<div>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n</div>\n\nHopefully
      it''s clear by now that this is a joke: an FP\u00b5FRO is just a\nstartup.\n\nThe
      point of this piece isn''t to criticize FROs or academia: both have\ntheir unique
      advantages relative to startups, and much has been written\nabout the relative
      advantages and disadvantages of different sorts of\nresearch institutions\n([e.g.](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros)).\n\nRather,
      I want to remind people that startups can do really good\nscientific work, something
      that many people seem to forget. It''s true\nthat basic research can be a public
      good, and something that''s difficult\nto monetize within a reasonable timeframe.
      But most research today isn''t\nquite this basic, which leads me to suspect
      that many activities today\nconfined to academic labs could be profitably conducted
      in startups.\n\nAcademics are generally very skeptical of organizations motivated
      by\nprofit. But all incentives are imperfect, and the drive to achieve\nprofitability
      pushes companies to provide value to real customers, which\nis more than many
      academics motivated by publication or prestige ever\nmanage to achieve. It seems
      likely that for organizations focused on\napplied research, profit is the least
      bad incentive.\n\nI''ll close with a quote from Eric Gilliam''s recent\n[essay](https://www.freaktakes.com/p/an-alternative-approach-to-deep-tech)\non
      a new model for \"deep tech\" startups:\n\n> Our corporate R&D labs in most
      industries have taken a step back in\n> how \"basic\" their research is. Meanwhile,
      what universities call\n> ''applied'' research has become much less applied
      than it used to be.\n> This ''middle'' of the deep tech pipeline has been hollowed
      out.\n\nWhat Eric proposes in his piece, and what I''m arguing here, is that\nscientific
      startups can help fill this void: not by replacing FROs and\nacademic research,
      but by complementing them.\n\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen for reading a draft of this

      sarcasm.*\\n\\nToday, most research is done by academic labs funded mainly by
      the\\ngovernment. Many articles have been written on the shortcomings with\\nacademic
      research: Sam Rodriques recently had a nice\\n[post](https://www.sam-rodriques.com/post/academia-is-an-educational-institution)\\nabout
      how academia is ultimately an educational institution, and how\\nthis limits
      the quality of academic research. (It's worth a read; I've\\nwritten about these
      issues from a\\n[few](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221026_structural_diversity.html)\\n[angles](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230502_startups.html),\\nand
      will probably write more at a later date.)\\n\\nThe major alternative to academic
      research that people put forward is\\n[focused research\\norganizations](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5)\\n(FROs):
      large, non-profit research organizations capable of tackling big\\nunsolved
      problems. These organizations, similar in scope and ambition to\\ne.g. CERN
      or LIGO, are envisioned to operate with a budget of \\\\$20--100M\\nover five
      years, making them substantially larger and more expensive\\nthan a single academic
      lab. This model is still being tested, but it\\nseems likely that some version
      of FROs will prove effective for\\nappropriately sized problems.\\n\\nBut FROs
      have some disadvantages, too: they represent a significant\\ninvestment on the
      part of funders, and so it's important to choose\\nprojects where there's a
      high likelihood of impact in the given area.\\n(In contrast, it's expected that
      most new academic labs will focus on\\nhigh-risk projects, and pivot if things
      don't work out in a few years.)\\nIn this piece, I propose a new form of scientific
      organization that\\ncombines aspects of both FROs and academic labs: for-profit
      micro\\nfocused research organizations (FP\xB5FROs).\\n\\nThe key insight behind
      FP\xB5FROs is that existing financial markets could\\nbe used to fund scientific
      research when there is a realistic\\npossibility for profit as a result of the
      research. This means that\\nFP\xB5FROs need not be funded by the government
      or philanthropic spending,\\nbut could instead raise capital from e.g. venture
      capitalists or angel\\ninvestors, who have access to substantially more money
      and are used to\\nmaking high-risk, high-reward investments.\\n\\nFP\xB5FROs
      would also be smaller and more nimble than full-fledged FROs,\\nable to tackle
      high-risk problems just like academia. But unlike\\nacademic labs, FP\xB5FROs
      would be able to spend more freely and hire more\\naggressively, thus circumventing
      the human capital issues that plague\\nacademic research. While most academic
      labs are staffed entirely with\\ninexperienced trainees (as Rodriques notes
      above), FP\xB5FROs could hire\\nexperienced scientists, engineers, and programmers,
      thus accelerating\\nthe rate of scientific progress.\\n\\nOne limitation of
      the FP\xB5FRO model is that research would need to be\\nprofitable within a
      reasonable time frame. But this limitation might\\nactually be a blessing in
      disguise: the need for profitability means\\nthat FP\xB5FROs would be incentivized
      to provide real value to firms, thus\\npreventing useless research through the
      magic of Adam Smith's invisible\\nhand.\\n\\nAnother disadvantage of FP\xB5FROs
      is that they must be able to achieve\\nsuccess with relatively little funding
      (probably around \\\\$10M; big for\\nacademia, but small compared to a FRO).
      This means that their projects\\nwould have to be modest in scope. I think this
      is probably a blessing in\\ndisguise, though. Consider the following advice
      [from Paul\\nGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html):\\n\\n> Empirically,
      the way to do really big things seems to be to start with\\n> deceptively small
      things.... Maybe it\\\\'s a bad idea to have really big\\n> ambitions initially,
      because the bigger your ambition, the longer\\n> it\\\\'s going to take, and
      the further you project into the future, the\\n> more likely you\\\\'ll get
      it wrong.\\n\\nThus, the need for FP\xB5FROs to focus on getting a single \\\"minimal
      viable\\nproduct\\\" right might be very helpful, and could even lead to more\\nimpactful
      firms later on.\\n\\nIn conclusion, FP\xB5FROs could combine the best qualities
      of academic labs\\nand FROs: they would be agile and risk-tolerant, like academic
      labs, but\\nproperly incentivized to produce useful research instead of publishing\\npapers,
      like FROs. This novel model should be investigated further as a\\nmechanism
      for generating new scientific discoveries at scale with\\nimmediate short-term
      utility.\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nHopefully
      it's clear by now that this is a joke: an FP\xB5FRO is just a\\nstartup.\\n\\nThe
      point of this piece isn't to criticize FROs or academia: both have\\ntheir unique
      advantages relative to startups, and much has been written\\nabout the relative
      advantages and disadvantages of different sorts of\\nresearch institutions\\n([e.g.](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros)).\\n\\nRather,
      I want to remind people that startups can do really good\\nscientific work,
      something that many people seem to forget. It's true\\nthat basic research can
      be a public good, and something that's difficult\\nto monetize within a reasonable
      timeframe. But most research today isn't\\nquite this basic, which leads me
      to suspect that many activities today\\nconfined to academic labs could be profitably
      conducted in startups.\\n\\nAcademics are generally very skeptical of organizations
      motivated by\\nprofit. But all incentives are imperfect, and the drive to achieve\\nprofitability
      pushes companies to provide value to real customers, which\\nis more than many
      academics motivated by publication or prestige ever\\nmanage to achieve. It
      seems likely that for organizations focused on\\napplied research, profit is
      the least bad incentive.\\n\\nI'll close with a quote from Eric Gilliam's recent\\n[essay](https://www.freaktakes.com/p/an-alternative-approach-to-deep-tech)\\non
      a new model for \\\"deep tech\\\" startups:\\n\\n> Our corporate R&D labs in
      most industries have taken a step back in\\n> how \\\"basic\\\" their research
      is. Meanwhile, what universities call\\n> 'applied' research has become much
      less applied than it used to be.\\n> This 'middle' of the deep tech pipeline
      has been hollowed out.\\n\\nWhat Eric proposes in his piece, and what I'm arguing
      here, is that\\nscientific startups can help fill this void: not by replacing
      FROs and\\nacademic research, but by complementing them.\\n\\n*Thanks to Ari

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "The concept
      of p*K*~a~ is introduced so early in the organic chemistry\ncurriculum that
      it''s easy to overlook what a remarkable idea it is.\n\n*Briefly, for the non-chemists
      reading this: p*K*~a~ is defined as the\nnegative base-10 logarithm of the acidity
      constant of a given acid\nH--A:*\n\np*K*~a~ := -log~10~(\\[HA\\]/\\[A-\\]\\[H+\\])\n\n*Unlike
      pH, which describes the acidity of a bulk solution, p*K*~a~\ndescribes the intrinsic
      proclivity of a molecule to shed a proton---a\ngiven molecule in a given solvent
      will always have the same p*K*~a~, no\nmatter the pH. This makes p*K*~a~ a very
      useful tool for ranking\nmolecules by their acidity (e.g. [the Evans\np](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[K](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[~a~\ntable](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)).*\n\nThe
      claim implicit in the definition of p*K*~a~ is that a single\nparameter suffices
      to describe the acidity of each molecule.^1^ In\ngeneral, this isn''t true in
      chemistry---there''s no single \"reactivity\"\nparameter which describes how
      reactive a given molecule is. For various\nregions of chemical space a two-parameter
      model can\n[work](https://www.cup.lmu.de/oc/mayr/reaktionsdatenbank/), but in\ngeneral
      we don''t expect to be able to evaluate the efficacy of a given\nreaction by
      looking up the reactivity values of the reactants and seeing\nif they''re close
      enough.\n\nInstead, structure and reactivity interact with each other in complex,\nhigh-dimensional
      ways. A diene will react with an electron-poor alkene\nand not an alcohol, while
      acetyl chloride doesn''t react with alkenes but\nwill readily acetylate alcohols,
      and a free radical might ignore both\nthe alkene and the alcohol and abstract
      a hydrogen from somewhere else.\nMaking sense of this confusing morass of different
      behaviors is, on some\nlevel, what organic chemistry is all about. The fact
      that the reactivity\nof different functional groups depends on reaction conditions
      is key to\nmost forms of synthesis!\n\nBut p*K*~a~ isn''t so complicated. If
      I want to know whether acetic acid\nwill protonate pyridine in a given solvent,
      all I have to do is look up\nthe p*K*~a~ values for acetic acid and pyridinium
      (pyridine''s conjugate\nacid). If pyridinium has a higher p*K*~a~, protonation
      will be favored;\notherwise, it''ll be disfavored. More generally, one can predict
      the\nequilibrium distribution of protons amongst *N* different sites from a\nlist
      of the corresponding p*K*~a~s.\n\nWhy is p*K*~a~ so well-behaved? The key assumption
      underlying the above\ndefinition is that ions are free and do not interact with
      one another.\nThis allows us to neglect any specific ion--ion interactions,
      and makes\nthe scale universal: if the pyridinium cation and the acetate anion\nnever
      interact, then I can learn everything I need to about pyridinium\nacetate just
      by measuring the p*K*~a~s of pyridine and acetic acid in\nisolation.\n\nThis
      assumption is quite good in solvents like water or DMSO, which\nexcel at stabilizing
      charged species, but progressively breaks down as\none travels to the realm
      of nonpolar solvents. As ions start to pair\nwith themselves, specific molecule--molecule
      interactions become\nimportant. The relative size of the anions can matter:
      in a nonpolar\nsolvent, a small anion will be better stabilized by a small cation
      than\nby a large, diffuse cation, meaning that e.g. acetate will appear more\nacidic
      when protonating smaller molecules. Other more quotidian\nintermolecular interactions,
      like hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-stacking, can\nalso play a role.\n\nAnd the
      ions aren''t the only thing that can stick together: aggregation\nof acids is
      often observed in nonpolar solvents. Benzenesulfonic acid\n[forms a\ntrimer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2116/analsci.15.303)
      in\nbenzonitrile solution, which is still pretty polar, and alcohols and\ncarboxylic
      acids are known to aggregate under a variety of conditions as\nwell.^2^ Even
      seemingly innocuous species like tetrabutylammonium\nchloride will aggregate
      at high concentrations\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja9723139),\n[ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1995/c3/c39950002513)).\n\nTo
      reliably extend p*K*~a~ scales to nonpolar solvents, one must thus\ndeliberately
      choose compounds which resist aggregation. As the\ndielectric constant drops,
      so does the number of such compounds. The\nclearest demonstration of this I''ve
      found is a series of papers\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo9713013),\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo0343477))

      while heroic, demonstrates the futility of measuring\np*K*~a~ in nonpolar media
      from the standpoint of the synthetic chemist.\nIf only weird fluoroalkanes engineered
      not to aggregate can have p*K*~a~\nvalues, then the scale may be analytically
      robust, but it''s hardly\nuseful for designing reactions!\n\nThe key point here
      is that the difficulty of measuring p*K*~a~ in\nnonpolar media is not an analytical
      barrier which can be surmounted by\nnew and improved technologies, but rather
      a fundamental breakdown in the\nidea of p*K*~a~ itself. Even the best p*K*~a~
      measurement tool in the\nworld can''t determine the p*K*~a~ of HCl in hexanes,
      because no such\nvalue exists---the concept itself is borderline nonsensical.
      Chloride\nwill ion-pair with everything in hexanes, hydrogen chloride will\naggregate
      with itself, chloride will stick to hydrogen chloride, and so\nforth. Asking
      for a p*K*~a~ in this context just doesn\\''t make much\nsense.^3^\n\nIt''s
      important to remember, however, that just because the p*K*~a~ scale\nno longer
      functions in nonpolar solvents doesn''t mean that acids don''t\nhave different
      acidities. Triflic acid in toluene will still protonate\njust about [everything](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol061174+),\nwhereas
      acetic acid will not. Instead, chemists wishing to think about\nacidity in nonpolar
      media have to accept 1that no one-dimensional scale\nwill be forthcoming. The
      idealized world of p*K*~a~ we''re accustomed to\nmay no longer function in nonpolar
      solvents, but chemistry itself still\nworks just fine.\n\n*Thanks to Ivo Leito

      concept of p*K*~a~ is introduced so early in the organic chemistry\\ncurriculum
      that it's easy to overlook what a remarkable idea it is.\\n\\n*Briefly, for
      the non-chemists reading this: p*K*~a~ is defined as the\\nnegative base-10
      logarithm of the acidity constant of a given acid\\nH--A:*\\n\\np*K*~a~ := -log~10~(\\\\[HA\\\\]/\\\\[A-\\\\]\\\\[H+\\\\])\\n\\n*Unlike
      pH, which describes the acidity of a bulk solution, p*K*~a~\\ndescribes the
      intrinsic proclivity of a molecule to shed a proton---a\\ngiven molecule in
      a given solvent will always have the same p*K*~a~, no\\nmatter the pH. This
      makes p*K*~a~ a very useful tool for ranking\\nmolecules by their acidity (e.g.
      [the Evans\\np](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[K](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[~a~\\ntable](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)).*\\n\\nThe
      claim implicit in the definition of p*K*~a~ is that a single\\nparameter suffices
      to describe the acidity of each molecule.^1^ In\\ngeneral, this isn't true in
      chemistry---there's no single \\\"reactivity\\\"\\nparameter which describes
      how reactive a given molecule is. For various\\nregions of chemical space a
      two-parameter model can\\n[work](https://www.cup.lmu.de/oc/mayr/reaktionsdatenbank/),
      but in\\ngeneral we don't expect to be able to evaluate the efficacy of a given\\nreaction
      by looking up the reactivity values of the reactants and seeing\\nif they're
      close enough.\\n\\nInstead, structure and reactivity interact with each other
      in complex,\\nhigh-dimensional ways. A diene will react with an electron-poor
      alkene\\nand not an alcohol, while acetyl chloride doesn't react with alkenes
      but\\nwill readily acetylate alcohols, and a free radical might ignore both\\nthe
      alkene and the alcohol and abstract a hydrogen from somewhere else.\\nMaking
      sense of this confusing morass of different behaviors is, on some\\nlevel, what
      organic chemistry is all about. The fact that the reactivity\\nof different
      functional groups depends on reaction conditions is key to\\nmost forms of synthesis!\\n\\nBut
      p*K*~a~ isn't so complicated. If I want to know whether acetic acid\\nwill protonate
      pyridine in a given solvent, all I have to do is look up\\nthe p*K*~a~ values
      for acetic acid and pyridinium (pyridine's conjugate\\nacid). If pyridinium
      has a higher p*K*~a~, protonation will be favored;\\notherwise, it'll be disfavored.
      More generally, one can predict the\\nequilibrium distribution of protons amongst
      *N* different sites from a\\nlist of the corresponding p*K*~a~s.\\n\\nWhy is
      p*K*~a~ so well-behaved? The key assumption underlying the above\\ndefinition
      is that ions are free and do not interact with one another.\\nThis allows us
      to neglect any specific ion--ion interactions, and makes\\nthe scale universal:
      if the pyridinium cation and the acetate anion\\nnever interact, then I can
      learn everything I need to about pyridinium\\nacetate just by measuring the
      p*K*~a~s of pyridine and acetic acid in\\nisolation.\\n\\nThis assumption is
      quite good in solvents like water or DMSO, which\\nexcel at stabilizing charged
      species, but progressively breaks down as\\none travels to the realm of nonpolar
      solvents. As ions start to pair\\nwith themselves, specific molecule--molecule
      interactions become\\nimportant. The relative size of the anions can matter:
      in a nonpolar\\nsolvent, a small anion will be better stabilized by a small
      cation than\\nby a large, diffuse cation, meaning that e.g. acetate will appear
      more\\nacidic when protonating smaller molecules. Other more quotidian\\nintermolecular
      interactions, like hydrogen bonding and \u03C0-stacking, can\\nalso play a role.\\n\\nAnd
      the ions aren't the only thing that can stick together: aggregation\\nof acids
      is often observed in nonpolar solvents. Benzenesulfonic acid\\n[forms a\\ntrimer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2116/analsci.15.303)
      in\\nbenzonitrile solution, which is still pretty polar, and alcohols and\\ncarboxylic
      acids are known to aggregate under a variety of conditions as\\nwell.^2^ Even
      seemingly innocuous species like tetrabutylammonium\\nchloride will aggregate
      at high concentrations\\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja9723139),\\n[ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1995/c3/c39950002513)).\\n\\nTo
      reliably extend p*K*~a~ scales to nonpolar solvents, one must thus\\ndeliberately
      choose compounds which resist aggregation. As the\\ndielectric constant drops,
      so does the number of such compounds. The\\nclearest demonstration of this I've
      found is a series of papers\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo9713013),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo0343477))

      effort, while heroic, demonstrates the futility of measuring\\np*K*~a~ in nonpolar
      media from the standpoint of the synthetic chemist.\\nIf only weird fluoroalkanes
      engineered not to aggregate can have p*K*~a~\\nvalues, then the scale may be
      analytically robust, but it's hardly\\nuseful for designing reactions!\\n\\nThe
      key point here is that the difficulty of measuring p*K*~a~ in\\nnonpolar media
      is not an analytical barrier which can be surmounted by\\nnew and improved technologies,
      but rather a fundamental breakdown in the\\nidea of p*K*~a~ itself. Even the
      best p*K*~a~ measurement tool in the\\nworld can't determine the p*K*~a~ of
      HCl in hexanes, because no such\\nvalue exists---the concept itself is borderline
      nonsensical. Chloride\\nwill ion-pair with everything in hexanes, hydrogen chloride
      will\\naggregate with itself, chloride will stick to hydrogen chloride, and
      so\\nforth. Asking for a p*K*~a~ in this context just doesn\\\\'t make much\\nsense.^3^\\n\\nIt's
      important to remember, however, that just because the p*K*~a~ scale\\nno longer
      functions in nonpolar solvents doesn't mean that acids don't\\nhave different
      acidities. Triflic acid in toluene will still protonate\\njust about [everything](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol061174+),\\nwhereas
      acetic acid will not. Instead, chemists wishing to think about\\nacidity in
      nonpolar media have to accept 1that no one-dimensional scale\\nwill be forthcoming.
      The idealized world of p*K*~a~ we're accustomed to\\nmay no longer function
      in nonpolar solvents, but chemistry itself still\\nworks just fine.\\n\\n*Thanks

      concept of p*K*~a~ is introduced so early in the organic chemistry\\ncurriculum
      that it's easy to overlook what a remarkable idea it is.\\n\\n*Briefly, for
      the non-chemists reading this: p*K*~a~ is defined as the\\nnegative base-10
      logarithm of the acidity constant of a given acid\\nH--A:*\\n\\np*K*~a~ := -log~10~(\\\\[HA\\\\]/\\\\[A-\\\\]\\\\[H+\\\\])\\n\\n*Unlike
      pH, which describes the acidity of a bulk solution, p*K*~a~\\ndescribes the
      intrinsic proclivity of a molecule to shed a proton---a\\ngiven molecule in
      a given solvent will always have the same p*K*~a~, no\\nmatter the pH. This
      makes p*K*~a~ a very useful tool for ranking\\nmolecules by their acidity (e.g.
      [the Evans\\np](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[K](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)*[~a~\\ntable](http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/MechOMs/evans_pKa_table.pdf)).*\\n\\nThe
      claim implicit in the definition of p*K*~a~ is that a single\\nparameter suffices
      to describe the acidity of each molecule.^1^ In\\ngeneral, this isn't true in
      chemistry---there's no single \\\"reactivity\\\"\\nparameter which describes
      how reactive a given molecule is. For various\\nregions of chemical space a
      two-parameter model can\\n[work](https://www.cup.lmu.de/oc/mayr/reaktionsdatenbank/),
      but in\\ngeneral we don't expect to be able to evaluate the efficacy of a given\\nreaction
      by looking up the reactivity values of the reactants and seeing\\nif they're
      close enough.\\n\\nInstead, structure and reactivity interact with each other
      in complex,\\nhigh-dimensional ways. A diene will react with an electron-poor
      alkene\\nand not an alcohol, while acetyl chloride doesn't react with alkenes
      but\\nwill readily acetylate alcohols, and a free radical might ignore both\\nthe
      alkene and the alcohol and abstract a hydrogen from somewhere else.\\nMaking
      sense of this confusing morass of different behaviors is, on some\\nlevel, what
      organic chemistry is all about. The fact that the reactivity\\nof different
      functional groups depends on reaction conditions is key to\\nmost forms of synthesis!\\n\\nBut
      p*K*~a~ isn't so complicated. If I want to know whether acetic acid\\nwill protonate
      pyridine in a given solvent, all I have to do is look up\\nthe p*K*~a~ values
      for acetic acid and pyridinium (pyridine's conjugate\\nacid). If pyridinium
      has a higher p*K*~a~, protonation will be favored;\\notherwise, it'll be disfavored.
      More generally, one can predict the\\nequilibrium distribution of protons amongst
      *N* different sites from a\\nlist of the corresponding p*K*~a~s.\\n\\nWhy is
      p*K*~a~ so well-behaved? The key assumption underlying the above\\ndefinition
      is that ions are free and do not interact with one another.\\nThis allows us
      to neglect any specific ion--ion interactions, and makes\\nthe scale universal:
      if the pyridinium cation and the acetate anion\\nnever interact, then I can
      learn everything I need to about pyridinium\\nacetate just by measuring the
      p*K*~a~s of pyridine and acetic acid in\\nisolation.\\n\\nThis assumption is
      quite good in solvents like water or DMSO, which\\nexcel at stabilizing charged
      species, but progressively breaks down as\\none travels to the realm of nonpolar
      solvents. As ions start to pair\\nwith themselves, specific molecule--molecule
      interactions become\\nimportant. The relative size of the anions can matter:
      in a nonpolar\\nsolvent, a small anion will be better stabilized by a small
      cation than\\nby a large, diffuse cation, meaning that e.g. acetate will appear
      more\\nacidic when protonating smaller molecules. Other more quotidian\\nintermolecular
      interactions, like hydrogen bonding and \u03C0-stacking, can\\nalso play a role.\\n\\nAnd
      the ions aren't the only thing that can stick together: aggregation\\nof acids
      is often observed in nonpolar solvents. Benzenesulfonic acid\\n[forms a\\ntrimer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2116/analsci.15.303)
      in\\nbenzonitrile solution, which is still pretty polar, and alcohols and\\ncarboxylic
      acids are known to aggregate under a variety of conditions as\\nwell.^2^ Even
      seemingly innocuous species like tetrabutylammonium\\nchloride will aggregate
      at high concentrations\\n([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja9723139),\\n[ref](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1995/c3/c39950002513)).\\n\\nTo
      reliably extend p*K*~a~ scales to nonpolar solvents, one must thus\\ndeliberately
      choose compounds which resist aggregation. As the\\ndielectric constant drops,
      so does the number of such compounds. The\\nclearest demonstration of this I've
      found is a series of papers\\n([1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo9713013),\\n[2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo0343477))

      effort, while heroic, demonstrates the futility of measuring\\np*K*~a~ in nonpolar
      media from the standpoint of the synthetic chemist.\\nIf only weird fluoroalkanes
      engineered not to aggregate can have p*K*~a~\\nvalues, then the scale may be
      analytically robust, but it's hardly\\nuseful for designing reactions!\\n\\nThe
      key point here is that the difficulty of measuring p*K*~a~ in\\nnonpolar media
      is not an analytical barrier which can be surmounted by\\nnew and improved technologies,
      but rather a fundamental breakdown in the\\nidea of p*K*~a~ itself. Even the
      best p*K*~a~ measurement tool in the\\nworld can't determine the p*K*~a~ of
      HCl in hexanes, because no such\\nvalue exists---the concept itself is borderline
      nonsensical. Chloride\\nwill ion-pair with everything in hexanes, hydrogen chloride
      will\\naggregate with itself, chloride will stick to hydrogen chloride, and
      so\\nforth. Asking for a p*K*~a~ in this context just doesn\\\\'t make much\\nsense.^3^\\n\\nIt's
      important to remember, however, that just because the p*K*~a~ scale\\nno longer
      functions in nonpolar solvents doesn't mean that acids don't\\nhave different
      acidities. Triflic acid in toluene will still protonate\\njust about [everything](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol061174+),\\nwhereas
      acetic acid will not. Instead, chemists wishing to think about\\nacidity in
      nonpolar media have to accept 1that no one-dimensional scale\\nwill be forthcoming.
      The idealized world of p*K*~a~ we're accustomed to\\nmay no longer function
      in nonpolar solvents, but chemistry itself still\\nworks just fine.\\n\\n*Thanks

      not a lab monkey. You ought not to view your\n    degree as \"six years of hard
      labor in the chemistry mines.\" Always\n    make time to go to interesting seminars,
      talk with other people\n    about their research, and read the literature. Otherwise,
      what''s the\n    point of being a scientist?\n\n2.  Only one person is really
      looking out for your best interests: you.\n    Your advisor, your classmates,
      and your collaborators all have their\n    own distinct incentives and interests,
      which will often roughly\n    align with yours, but will never align perfectly.\n\n3.  Your
      research interests will also not match up perfectly with those\n    of your
      advisor. Your job as a graduate student is to find the\n    intersection between
      what the two of you care about, and work there.\n    Otherwise, one of you will
      be unhappy.\n\n4.  The more non-chemists in your life, the better your mental
      health\n    will be. (h/t [Arthur\n    Brooks](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/04/deep-friendships-aristotle/618529/))\n\n5.  Try
      to maximize the ratio of \"thinking\"/publishable work to mindless\n    SI work.
      Any project will take some grinding, but the thinking work\n    is (ideally)
      what you''ve been recruited for, what you''ll present on,\n    and what''ll
      get you a job. If your advisor views you only as a set\n    of hands... be very
      worried.\n\n6.  Cold emails to scientists work much better than it seems they
      ought\n    to. Most professors spend their entire career trying to get people\n    to
      care about their work---if you''re interested, they''ll usually\n    talk your
      ear off.\n\n7.  Read your PI''s old papers, as many as possible. Too often students\n    are
      totally ignorant of the work that occurred a decade before they\n    joined
      the lab, and end up repeating it or falling into the same\n    pitfalls time
      and time again.\n\n8.  Learn to code; please stop performing curve fits in Excel.
      (cf.\n    [pmarca](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/))\n\n9.  Be
      outcome focused. Each day, ask yourself \"What is the biggest\n    problem I''m
      facing in my research?\" If whatever you''re doing isn''t\n    addressing that
      problem, you''re wasting your time. Sometimes this\n    means stopping all experiments
      and reading papers for a few weeks;\n    sometimes this looks like running reactions;
      sometimes this looks\n    like just sitting at your desk and writing. (h/t Brian
      Liau for\n    giving me this advice when I started graduate school)\n\n10. Be
      outcome focused on the big scale, too. Figure out what success in\n    graduate
      school looks like---what your ideal job is, and what it\n    takes to get that
      sort of job---and then pursue those outcomes\n    relentlessly. Perhaps in an
      ideal world we could all follow our\n    natural curiosity to our heart''s content,
      but that''s not real life,\n    not in science as I''ve known it.\n\n11. Success
      in graduate school may be necessary for your life goals, but\n    it won''t
      be sufficient. At the end of the day, science is just a\n    job, and your molecules
      will never love you. So don''t work so hard\n    that you put the rest of your
      life on hold; don''t make science the\n    highest good in your worldview. (cf.\n    [Augustine](https://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/disordered_love.pdf))\n",

      a scientist, not a lab monkey. You ought not to view your\\n    degree as \\\"six
      years of hard labor in the chemistry mines.\\\" Always\\n    make time to go
      to interesting seminars, talk with other people\\n    about their research,
      and read the literature. Otherwise, what's the\\n    point of being a scientist?\\n\\n2.
      \ Only one person is really looking out for your best interests: you.\\n    Your
      advisor, your classmates, and your collaborators all have their\\n    own distinct
      incentives and interests, which will often roughly\\n    align with yours, but
      will never align perfectly.\\n\\n3.  Your research interests will also not match
      up perfectly with those\\n    of your advisor. Your job as a graduate student
      is to find the\\n    intersection between what the two of you care about, and
      work there.\\n    Otherwise, one of you will be unhappy.\\n\\n4.  The more non-chemists
      in your life, the better your mental health\\n    will be. (h/t [Arthur\\n    Brooks](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/04/deep-friendships-aristotle/618529/))\\n\\n5.
      \ Try to maximize the ratio of \\\"thinking\\\"/publishable work to mindless\\n
      \   SI work. Any project will take some grinding, but the thinking work\\n    is
      (ideally) what you've been recruited for, what you'll present on,\\n    and
      what'll get you a job. If your advisor views you only as a set\\n    of hands...
      be very worried.\\n\\n6.  Cold emails to scientists work much better than it
      seems they ought\\n    to. Most professors spend their entire career trying
      to get people\\n    to care about their work---if you're interested, they'll
      usually\\n    talk your ear off.\\n\\n7.  Read your PI's old papers, as many
      as possible. Too often students\\n    are totally ignorant of the work that
      occurred a decade before they\\n    joined the lab, and end up repeating it
      or falling into the same\\n    pitfalls time and time again.\\n\\n8.  Learn
      to code; please stop performing curve fits in Excel. (cf.\\n    [pmarca](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/))\\n\\n9.
      \ Be outcome focused. Each day, ask yourself \\\"What is the biggest\\n    problem
      I'm facing in my research?\\\" If whatever you're doing isn't\\n    addressing
      that problem, you're wasting your time. Sometimes this\\n    means stopping
      all experiments and reading papers for a few weeks;\\n    sometimes this looks
      like running reactions; sometimes this looks\\n    like just sitting at your
      desk and writing. (h/t Brian Liau for\\n    giving me this advice when I started
      graduate school)\\n\\n10. Be outcome focused on the big scale, too. Figure out
      what success in\\n    graduate school looks like---what your ideal job is, and
      what it\\n    takes to get that sort of job---and then pursue those outcomes\\n
      \   relentlessly. Perhaps in an ideal world we could all follow our\\n    natural
      curiosity to our heart's content, but that's not real life,\\n    not in science
      as I've known it.\\n\\n11. Success in graduate school may be necessary for your
      life goals, but\\n    it won't be sufficient. At the end of the day, science
      is just a\\n    job, and your molecules will never love you. So don't work so
      hard\\n    that you put the rest of your life on hold; don't make science the\\n
      \   highest good in your worldview. (cf.\\n    [Augustine](https://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/disordered_love.pdf))\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"132832298\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      a scientist, not a lab monkey. You ought not to view your\\n    degree as \\\"six
      years of hard labor in the chemistry mines.\\\" Always\\n    make time to go
      to interesting seminars, talk with other people\\n    about their research,
      and read the literature. Otherwise, what's the\\n    point of being a scientist?\\n\\n2.
      \ Only one person is really looking out for your best interests: you.\\n    Your
      advisor, your classmates, and your collaborators all have their\\n    own distinct
      incentives and interests, which will often roughly\\n    align with yours, but
      will never align perfectly.\\n\\n3.  Your research interests will also not match
      up perfectly with those\\n    of your advisor. Your job as a graduate student
      is to find the\\n    intersection between what the two of you care about, and
      work there.\\n    Otherwise, one of you will be unhappy.\\n\\n4.  The more non-chemists
      in your life, the better your mental health\\n    will be. (h/t [Arthur\\n    Brooks](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/04/deep-friendships-aristotle/618529/))\\n\\n5.
      \ Try to maximize the ratio of \\\"thinking\\\"/publishable work to mindless\\n
      \   SI work. Any project will take some grinding, but the thinking work\\n    is
      (ideally) what you've been recruited for, what you'll present on,\\n    and
      what'll get you a job. If your advisor views you only as a set\\n    of hands...
      be very worried.\\n\\n6.  Cold emails to scientists work much better than it
      seems they ought\\n    to. Most professors spend their entire career trying
      to get people\\n    to care about their work---if you're interested, they'll
      usually\\n    talk your ear off.\\n\\n7.  Read your PI's old papers, as many
      as possible. Too often students\\n    are totally ignorant of the work that
      occurred a decade before they\\n    joined the lab, and end up repeating it
      or falling into the same\\n    pitfalls time and time again.\\n\\n8.  Learn
      to code; please stop performing curve fits in Excel. (cf.\\n    [pmarca](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/))\\n\\n9.
      \ Be outcome focused. Each day, ask yourself \\\"What is the biggest\\n    problem
      I'm facing in my research?\\\" If whatever you're doing isn't\\n    addressing
      that problem, you're wasting your time. Sometimes this\\n    means stopping
      all experiments and reading papers for a few weeks;\\n    sometimes this looks
      like running reactions; sometimes this looks\\n    like just sitting at your
      desk and writing. (h/t Brian Liau for\\n    giving me this advice when I started
      graduate school)\\n\\n10. Be outcome focused on the big scale, too. Figure out
      what success in\\n    graduate school looks like---what your ideal job is, and
      what it\\n    takes to get that sort of job---and then pursue those outcomes\\n
      \   relentlessly. Perhaps in an ideal world we could all follow our\\n    natural
      curiosity to our heart's content, but that's not real life,\\n    not in science
      as I've known it.\\n\\n11. Success in graduate school may be necessary for your
      life goals, but\\n    it won't be sufficient. At the end of the day, science
      is just a\\n    job, and your molecules will never love you. So don't work so
      hard\\n    that you put the rest of your life on hold; don't make science the\\n
      \   highest good in your worldview. (cf.\\n    [Augustine](https://www3.dbu.edu/naugle/pdf/disordered_love.pdf))\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"132832298\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      But a few recent experiences remind me of the value that peer\nreview provides:
      in today''s scientific culture, peer review is\nessentially the only time that
      scientists get honest and unbiased\nfeedback on their work.\n\nHow can this
      be true? In experimental science, scientists typically work\nalongside other
      students and postdocs under the supervision of a\nprofessor. This body of people
      forms a lab, also known as a research\ngroup, and it''s to these people that
      you present most frequently. Your\nlab generally knows the techniques and methods
      that you employ very\nwell: so if you''ve misinterpreted a piece of data or
      designed an\nexperiment poorly, group meeting is a great place to get feedback.\n\nBut
      a lab is also biased in certain ways. People are attracted to a lab\nbecause
      they think the science is exciting and shows promise, and so\nthey''re likely
      to be credulous about positive results. Certain labs also\ndevelop beliefs or
      dogmas about how to conduct science: the best ways to\nperform a mechanistic
      study, or the most useful reaction conditions. To\nsome extent, every lab is
      a paradigm unto itself. This means that\nparadigm-shifting criticism is hard
      to find among one''s coworkers, even\nif it''s common in the outside world.\n\nHere
      are some examples of controversial-in-the-field statements that are\nunlikely
      to be controversial within given labs:\n\n- Palladium-based catalysis is going
      to become obsolete due to the\n  scarcity of Pd and must be replaced. [Some\n  labs](https://www.dal.ca/sites/stradiotto/research.html)
      build their\n  research program around this; others think Pd will always be
      relevant.\n\n- Water is the greenest possible solvent. Some scientists believe
      this\n  [wholeheartedly](https://lipshutz.chem.ucsb.edu/research), while\n  others
      think it''s stupid (for instance, a 2021\n  [review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-021-02188-8)\n  states
      that \"to meet regulations concerning the discharge of waste\n  water into rivers
      and other natural waters... \\[water\\] often requires\n  very extensive treatment
      prior to discharge, making the use of water\n  as a reaction medium much less
      attractive.\")\n\n- More broadly, the belief that machine learning and generative
      AI are\n  the future of chemical discovery: while many computational chemists\n  believe
      this, plenty of experimentalists (even young ones) are pretty\n  skeptical.\n\nIn
      each of these cases, it''s unlikely that criticism along these lines\nis available
      internally: people who''ve chosen to do their PhDs studying\nML in chemistry
      aren''t likely to criticize your paper for\noveremphasizing the importance of
      ML in chemistry!\n\nMore generally, internal criticism works best when a lab
      serves as a\nshared repository of expertise, i.e. when everyone in the lab has\nroughly
      the same skillset. Some labs focus instead on a single\noverarching goal and
      employ many different tools to get to that point: a\ngiven chemical biology
      group might have a synthetic chemist, a MS\nspecialist, a genomics guru, a mechanistic
      enzymologist, and someone\nspecializing in cell culture. If this is the case,
      your techniques are\nopaque to your coworkers: what advice can someone who does
      cell culture\ngive about improving Q-TOF signal-to-noise?\n\nIdeally, one''s
      professor is well-versed enough in each of the techniques\nemployed that he
      or she can dispense criticism as needed. But professors\nare often busy, aren''t
      always operational experts at each of the\ntechniques they oversee, and suffer
      from the same viewpoint biases that\ntheir students do (perhaps even more so).\n\nSo,
      it''s important to solicit feedback from external sources.\nUnfortunately, at
      least in my experience most external feedback is too\npositive: \"great talk,\"
      \"nice job,\" etc. Our scientific culture tries so\nhard to be supportive that
      I almost never get any meaningful criticism\nfrom people outside my group, either
      publicly or privately. (Ideally\none''s committee would help, but I never really
      got to present research\nresults to my committee, and this doesn''t help postdocs
      anyhow.)\n\nPeer review, then, serves as the last bastion against low-quality\nscience:
      reviewers are outside the lab, have no incentive to be nice,\nand are tasked
      specifically with poking holes in your argument or\npointing out extra experiments
      that would improve it. Peer review has\nimproved each one of my papers, and
      I''m grateful for\nit.[^1^](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/fn1)\n\nWhat''s
      a little sad is that the excellent feedback that reviewers give\nonly comes
      at the bitter end of a project, which for me has often meant\nthat the results
      are more than a year old and my collaborators have\nmoved on. Much more useful
      would be critical feedback delivered early on\nin a project, when my own thinking
      is more flexible and the barrier to\nrunning additional experiments is lower.
      And more useful still would be\nhigh-quality criticism available at every step
      of the project, given not\nanonymously but by people whom you can talk to and
      learn from.\n\nWhat might this practically look like?\n\n- A culture of \"red
      teaming,\" where students are incentivized to find\n  flaws in others'' projects
      in somewhat adversarial ways. This would\n  need to be done within a supportive
      and collegial atmosphere, lest it\n  degenerate into bullying: red teaming need
      not be red in tooth and\n  claw.\n\n- Similarly, PIs could invite other professors
      to come to group meetings\n  and (constructively) criticize the projects, particularly
      professors\n  from adjacent subfields who might have different perspectives.\n\n-
      Poster presentations or talks (at conferences), although often used to\n  present
      finished projects, can also be used to present unfinished\n  work. I presented
      some unfinished work at\n  [TPOC](http://jiwu.chem.uh.edu/tpoc.html) a few years
      ago, and got\n  really helpful suggestions from Ken Houk and Dean Tantillo that\n  fundamentally
      changed how we approached the rest of the project. Maybe\n  this is something
      that we should encourage more, although finished\n  projects will probably always
      look more impressive than unfinished\n  projects.\n\n- Decentralized peer review
      solutions like *[Seeds of\n  Science](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/)* or\n  *[PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/)*
      might also help here, but my sense\n  is that it''s unlikely that qualified
      experts will just spend their\n  time investigating something that they found
      online; they need to be\n  solicited somehow.\n\nI don''t know what the right
      solution looks like here: the burden of peer\nreview is already substantial,
      and I don''t mean to suggest that this\nwork ought to be arbitrarily multiplied
      for free. But I do worry that\neliminating peer review, absent other changes,
      would simply mean that\none of the only meaningful chances to get unfiltered
      feedback on one''s\nscience would be eliminated, and that this would be bad.\n\n*Thanks
      to Croix Laconsay and Lucas Karas for helpful feedback on this\npiece.*\n\n###
      **Footnotes**\n\n1.  It\\''s also true that the threat of peer review increases
      paper\n    quality. I agree with\n    [Singleton](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1528877848093954048?s=20)\n    that
      this is important today, but am less convinced that this is\n    necessary from
      an institutional design perspective: if peer review\n    didn\\''t exist, I
      think some other system of norms or regulations\n    would spring forth to protect
      good-quality science. See the\n    \\\"Anarchic Preprint Lake\\\" discussion

      to be controversial within given labs:\\n\\n- Palladium-based catalysis is going
      to become obsolete due to the\\n  scarcity of Pd and must be replaced. [Some\\n
      \ labs](https://www.dal.ca/sites/stradiotto/research.html) build their\\n  research
      program around this; others think Pd will always be relevant.\\n\\n- Water is
      the greenest possible solvent. Some scientists believe this\\n  [wholeheartedly](https://lipshutz.chem.ucsb.edu/research),
      while\\n  others think it's stupid (for instance, a 2021\\n  [review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-021-02188-8)\\n
      \ states that \\\"to meet regulations concerning the discharge of waste\\n  water
      into rivers and other natural waters... \\\\[water\\\\] often requires\\n  very
      extensive treatment prior to discharge, making the use of water\\n  as a reaction
      medium much less attractive.\\\")\\n\\n- More broadly, the belief that machine
      learning and generative AI are\\n  the future of chemical discovery: while many
      computational chemists\\n  believe this, plenty of experimentalists (even young
      ones) are pretty\\n  skeptical.\\n\\nIn each of these cases, it's unlikely that
      criticism along these lines\\nis available internally: people who've chosen
      to do their PhDs studying\\nML in chemistry aren't likely to criticize your
      paper for\\noveremphasizing the importance of ML in chemistry!\\n\\nMore generally,
      internal criticism works best when a lab serves as a\\nshared repository of
      expertise, i.e. when everyone in the lab has\\nroughly the same skillset. Some
      labs focus instead on a single\\noverarching goal and employ many different
      tools to get to that point: a\\ngiven chemical biology group might have a synthetic
      chemist, a MS\\nspecialist, a genomics guru, a mechanistic enzymologist, and
      someone\\nspecializing in cell culture. If this is the case, your techniques
      are\\nopaque to your coworkers: what advice can someone who does cell culture\\ngive
      about improving Q-TOF signal-to-noise?\\n\\nIdeally, one's professor is well-versed
      enough in each of the techniques\\nemployed that he or she can dispense criticism
      as needed. But professors\\nare often busy, aren't always operational experts
      at each of the\\ntechniques they oversee, and suffer from the same viewpoint
      biases that\\ntheir students do (perhaps even more so).\\n\\nSo, it's important
      to solicit feedback from external sources.\\nUnfortunately, at least in my experience
      most external feedback is too\\npositive: \\\"great talk,\\\" \\\"nice job,\\\"
      etc. Our scientific culture tries so\\nhard to be supportive that I almost never
      get any meaningful criticism\\nfrom people outside my group, either publicly
      or privately. (Ideally\\none's committee would help, but I never really got
      to present research\\nresults to my committee, and this doesn't help postdocs
      anyhow.)\\n\\nPeer review, then, serves as the last bastion against low-quality\\nscience:
      reviewers are outside the lab, have no incentive to be nice,\\nand are tasked
      specifically with poking holes in your argument or\\npointing out extra experiments
      that would improve it. Peer review has\\nimproved each one of my papers, and
      I'm grateful for\\nit.[^1^](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/fn1)\\n\\nWhat's
      a little sad is that the excellent feedback that reviewers give\\nonly comes
      at the bitter end of a project, which for me has often meant\\nthat the results
      are more than a year old and my collaborators have\\nmoved on. Much more useful
      would be critical feedback delivered early on\\nin a project, when my own thinking
      is more flexible and the barrier to\\nrunning additional experiments is lower.
      And more useful still would be\\nhigh-quality criticism available at every step
      of the project, given not\\nanonymously but by people whom you can talk to and
      learn from.\\n\\nWhat might this practically look like?\\n\\n- A culture of
      \\\"red teaming,\\\" where students are incentivized to find\\n  flaws in others'
      projects in somewhat adversarial ways. This would\\n  need to be done within
      a supportive and collegial atmosphere, lest it\\n  degenerate into bullying:
      red teaming need not be red in tooth and\\n  claw.\\n\\n- Similarly, PIs could
      invite other professors to come to group meetings\\n  and (constructively) criticize
      the projects, particularly professors\\n  from adjacent subfields who might
      have different perspectives.\\n\\n- Poster presentations or talks (at conferences),
      although often used to\\n  present finished projects, can also be used to present
      unfinished\\n  work. I presented some unfinished work at\\n  [TPOC](http://jiwu.chem.uh.edu/tpoc.html)
      a few years ago, and got\\n  really helpful suggestions from Ken Houk and Dean
      Tantillo that\\n  fundamentally changed how we approached the rest of the project.
      Maybe\\n  this is something that we should encourage more, although finished\\n
      \ projects will probably always look more impressive than unfinished\\n  projects.\\n\\n-
      Decentralized peer review solutions like *[Seeds of\\n  Science](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/)*
      or\\n  *[PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/)* might also help here, but my sense\\n

      somehow.\\n\\nI don't know what the right solution looks like here: the burden
      of peer\\nreview is already substantial, and I don't mean to suggest that this\\nwork

      But a few recent experiences remind me of the value that peer\\nreview provides:
      in today's scientific culture, peer review is\\nessentially the only time that
      scientists get honest and unbiased\\nfeedback on their work.\\n\\nHow can this
      be true? In experimental science, scientists typically work\\nalongside other
      students and postdocs under the supervision of a\\nprofessor. This body of people
      forms a lab, also known as a research\\ngroup, and it's to these people that
      you present most frequently. Your\\nlab generally knows the techniques and methods
      that you employ very\\nwell: so if you've misinterpreted a piece of data or
      designed an\\nexperiment poorly, group meeting is a great place to get feedback.\\n\\nBut
      a lab is also biased in certain ways. People are attracted to a lab\\nbecause
      they think the science is exciting and shows promise, and so\\nthey're likely
      to be credulous about positive results. Certain labs also\\ndevelop beliefs
      or dogmas about how to conduct science: the best ways to\\nperform a mechanistic
      study, or the most useful reaction conditions. To\\nsome extent, every lab is
      a paradigm unto itself. This means that\\nparadigm-shifting criticism is hard
      to find among one's coworkers, even\\nif it's common in the outside world.\\n\\nHere
      are some examples of controversial-in-the-field statements that are\\nunlikely

      encountered organic chemistry on Wikipedia, my freshman year of\nhigh school.
      The complexity and arcanity of the field instantly\nattracted me: here was something
      interesting that I didn''t know about\nand which didn''t require years of mathematical
      training to approach\n(unlike most of physics).\n\nI soon started reading about
      organic chemistry more and more, albeit\nwith no rhyme or reason to my study.
      I didn''t know what the good\ntextbooks were, what order to study things in
      or which concepts ought to\nbe understood in depth before progressing further.
      Organic chemistry was\njust a \"[glass bead\ngame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game)\"
      to me, an art\nof symbols devoid of any real-world representations. But enthusiasm
      can\nsometimes suffice where wisdom is lacking.\n\nWith the support of a teacher
      and a half-dozen friends who also wanted\nto learn more organic chemistry, we
      started a little independent study.\nWe met in a closet and read a textbook,
      worked through the problems, and\nour teacher wrote us tests. We eventually
      managed to get through all of\nPaula Bruice, although various misconceptions
      (and mispronunciations)\nstayed with me until I took Movassaghi''s course at

      of some work from high school, which\ndoes not in fact make very much sense.
      (I think this is from the Evans\nproblem set library.)</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nBut
      in high school we had no lab, and thus no practical knowledge. We\nsplit into
      two groups and tried to come up with experiments for\nourselves, but the results
      were dismal. Here''s the procedure (copied\nverbatim) for the one and only reaction
      we ran, synthesis of\nnitrobenzene via nitration of benzene, which was to be
      the first step in\na multistep synthesis of Kevlar:\n\n> In a 250 mL beaker,
      dissolve benzene in a solution of concentrated\n> H~2~SO~4~ of twice its volume.
      Use an ice-salt bath to bring this\n> solution to 0 \u00b0C or below, and use
      a Pasteur pipette to slowly add a\n> 1:1 solution of HNO~3~ and H~2~SO~4~ (be
      sure to keep the solution\n> below 15 degrees Celsius at all times, as the reaction
      is strongly\n> exothermic). Once all the solution has been added, warm it to
      room\n> temperature and allow it to sit for 15 minutes.  \n>   \n> Pour the
      solution over 50 g of crushed ice in a 250 mL beaker. Once\n> the ice has melted,
      isolate the product via vacuum filtration via a\n> Buchner funnel and rinse
      it twice with water and twice with methanol.\n> Recrystallize in a solution
      of methanol.\n\nThe astute observer will notice that there aren''t very many
      details\nhere. How much benzene? How much nitric acid? We didn''t have the\nglassware
      mentioned above---neither a beaker nor a Buchner funnel. And,\nperhaps most
      damningly, the procedure calls for isolation by filtration,\nchallenging since
      nitrobenzene is a liquid at room temperature.\n\nDespite these problems, we
      successfully ran this reaction (open to air,\nnot in a fume hood), and obtained
      the product. I vividly recall the\nyellow bubbles of nitrobenzene floating to
      the top of the vial, and the\nsmell of cherries that filled the room, a smell
      that returns to me in\nProustian fashion from time to time when using certain
      reagents. We\ndidn''t have a separatory funnel (or we didn''t know how to use
      it if we\ndid), so we fished some of the nitrobenzene out with a Pasteur pipette\nand
      threw the rest away.\n\nA little bit of knowledge would have served us well,
      as would have\ngloves and a fume hood. Here''s\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene):\n\n>
      Prolonged exposure \\[to nitrobenzene\\] may cause serious damage to the\n>
      central nervous system, impair vision, cause liver or kidney damage,\n> anemia
      and lung irritation. Inhalation of vapors may induce headache,\n> nausea, fatigue,
      dizziness, cyanosis, weakness in the arms and legs,\n> and in rare cases may
      be fatal...  \n>   \n> Nitrobenzene is considered a likely human carcinogen
      by the United\n> States Environmental Protection Agency, and is classified by
      the IARC\n> as a Group 2B carcinogen which is \\\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\\\".\n\nIndeed,
      a coworker of mine would later be sent to the hospital after\nspilling nitrobenzene
      on herself. Surprisingly, my group''s experiment\nstill ended up being the safer
      one---the lab portion of our course was\ndisbanded the following day after my
      classmates caused an explosion with\nthionyl chloride.\n\nI was fortunate enough
      to land a summer research internship in the\nSessler lab at UT the following
      summer, and I started studying chemistry\nin earnest: column chromatography,
      Anslyn/Dougherty, NMR spectroscopy,\nand all the rest. I remember the first
      reaction I ran at UT:\nretro-Friedel--Crafts dealkylation of a calix\\[4\\]arene,
      using about 10\ng each of phenol and aluminum(III) chloride. The brutal physicality
      of\nlab work was a nice contrast to the gnosticism of software (where I''d\nworked
      previously), and I was hooked.\n\nI''ll fast-forward through the more recent
      parts of my chemical career: I\nwent to MIT and joined the Imperiali lab to
      work on essentially a\nmedicinal chemistry project: hit-to-lead optimization,
      featuring lots of\nde novo heterocycle synthesis. I got to cook reactions in
      molten urea,\nquench 500 mL of phosphorus oxychloride at a time, and even design
      new\nroutes (with a little oversight from my postdoc). It was awesome.\n\n:::

      defended my dissertation on June 5th, and cleaned out my hood last\nweek. For
      the foreseeable future, I''ll be a purely computational\nchemist---computation
      is advancing quickly, and I think that''s where I\nhave the most to offer the
      field right now. But I''ll miss the sights and\nsounds of the lab. There''s
      a satisfaction to making a new molecule and\nholding the final product in your
      hands: the knowledge that you''ve\nreshaped this little corner of reality through
      your own actions, and\nthat this particular arrangement of matter has never
      existed before.\n\nAnd simulation is, at the end of the day, only useful insofar
      as it\nhelps us make real molecules. There may be people who wish to model\nreactions
      purely for the sake of modeling them, but I am not one of\nthem. What drew me
      to simulation initially, and what still attracts me\nto the field today, is
      its potential to help experimental scientists do\ntheir work faster and better.
      It was easy for me to ensure that this was\ntrue when I was both doing the experiments
      and running the simulations;\nmy incentives were aligned properly. It will be
      harder in the future.\n\nThere''s a seductive appeal in leaving lab work behind
      altogether, too,\nand one that''s dangerous. Any experimentalist who''s worked
      with a\ncomputational collaborator knows that nothing ever works precisely as\nmodeled.
      There are untold depths of chemical behavior still inaccessible\nto the idealized
      world of simulation, and it''s all too easy for\ncomputational chemists just
      to look the other way. Life is easier when\nyou don''t have to deal with sludgy
      workups or poorly soluble\nintermediates, but they don''t go away just because
      you can''t model them\nby DFT---reality has a way of keeping us honest that
      simulations\nfrequently lack.\n\nSo, although I bid lab farewell at this point
      in my career, it''s a\nbittersweet parting. I hope to return someday; only time
      will tell.\n\n*Thanks to Jacob Thackston for reading a draft of this piece.*\n",

      first encountered organic chemistry on Wikipedia, my freshman year of\\nhigh
      school. The complexity and arcanity of the field instantly\\nattracted me: here
      was something interesting that I didn't know about\\nand which didn't require
      years of mathematical training to approach\\n(unlike most of physics).\\n\\nI
      soon started reading about organic chemistry more and more, albeit\\nwith no
      rhyme or reason to my study. I didn't know what the good\\ntextbooks were, what
      order to study things in or which concepts ought to\\nbe understood in depth
      before progressing further. Organic chemistry was\\njust a \\\"[glass bead\\ngame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game)\\\"
      to me, an art\\nof symbols devoid of any real-world representations. But enthusiasm
      can\\nsometimes suffice where wisdom is lacking.\\n\\nWith the support of a
      teacher and a half-dozen friends who also wanted\\nto learn more organic chemistry,
      we started a little independent study.\\nWe met in a closet and read a textbook,
      worked through the problems, and\\nour teacher wrote us tests. We eventually
      managed to get through all of\\nPaula Bruice, although various misconceptions

      of some work from high school, which\\ndoes not in fact make very much sense.
      (I think this is from the Evans\\nproblem set library.)</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nBut
      in high school we had no lab, and thus no practical knowledge. We\\nsplit into
      two groups and tried to come up with experiments for\\nourselves, but the results
      were dismal. Here's the procedure (copied\\nverbatim) for the one and only reaction
      we ran, synthesis of\\nnitrobenzene via nitration of benzene, which was to be
      the first step in\\na multistep synthesis of Kevlar:\\n\\n> In a 250 mL beaker,
      dissolve benzene in a solution of concentrated\\n> H~2~SO~4~ of twice its volume.
      Use an ice-salt bath to bring this\\n> solution to 0 \xB0C or below, and use
      a Pasteur pipette to slowly add a\\n> 1:1 solution of HNO~3~ and H~2~SO~4~ (be
      sure to keep the solution\\n> below 15 degrees Celsius at all times, as the
      reaction is strongly\\n> exothermic). Once all the solution has been added,
      warm it to room\\n> temperature and allow it to sit for 15 minutes.  \\n>   \\n>
      Pour the solution over 50 g of crushed ice in a 250 mL beaker. Once\\n> the
      ice has melted, isolate the product via vacuum filtration via a\\n> Buchner
      funnel and rinse it twice with water and twice with methanol.\\n> Recrystallize
      in a solution of methanol.\\n\\nThe astute observer will notice that there aren't
      very many details\\nhere. How much benzene? How much nitric acid? We didn't
      have the\\nglassware mentioned above---neither a beaker nor a Buchner funnel.
      And,\\nperhaps most damningly, the procedure calls for isolation by filtration,\\nchallenging
      since nitrobenzene is a liquid at room temperature.\\n\\nDespite these problems,
      we successfully ran this reaction (open to air,\\nnot in a fume hood), and obtained
      the product. I vividly recall the\\nyellow bubbles of nitrobenzene floating
      to the top of the vial, and the\\nsmell of cherries that filled the room, a
      smell that returns to me in\\nProustian fashion from time to time when using
      certain reagents. We\\ndidn't have a separatory funnel (or we didn't know how
      to use it if we\\ndid), so we fished some of the nitrobenzene out with a Pasteur
      pipette\\nand threw the rest away.\\n\\nA little bit of knowledge would have
      served us well, as would have\\ngloves and a fume hood. Here's\\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene):\\n\\n>
      Prolonged exposure \\\\[to nitrobenzene\\\\] may cause serious damage to the\\n>
      central nervous system, impair vision, cause liver or kidney damage,\\n> anemia
      and lung irritation. Inhalation of vapors may induce headache,\\n> nausea, fatigue,
      dizziness, cyanosis, weakness in the arms and legs,\\n> and in rare cases may
      be fatal...  \\n>   \\n> Nitrobenzene is considered a likely human carcinogen
      by the United\\n> States Environmental Protection Agency, and is classified
      by the IARC\\n> as a Group 2B carcinogen which is \\\\\\\"possibly carcinogenic
      to humans\\\\\\\".\\n\\nIndeed, a coworker of mine would later be sent to the
      hospital after\\nspilling nitrobenzene on herself. Surprisingly, my group's
      experiment\\nstill ended up being the safer one---the lab portion of our course
      was\\ndisbanded the following day after my classmates caused an explosion with\\nthionyl
      chloride.\\n\\nI was fortunate enough to land a summer research internship in
      the\\nSessler lab at UT the following summer, and I started studying chemistry\\nin
      earnest: column chromatography, Anslyn/Dougherty, NMR spectroscopy,\\nand all
      the rest. I remember the first reaction I ran at UT:\\nretro-Friedel--Crafts
      dealkylation of a calix\\\\[4\\\\]arene, using about 10\\ng each of phenol and
      aluminum(III) chloride. The brutal physicality of\\nlab work was a nice contrast
      to the gnosticism of software (where I'd\\nworked previously), and I was hooked.\\n\\nI'll
      fast-forward through the more recent parts of my chemical career: I\\nwent to
      MIT and joined the Imperiali lab to work on essentially a\\nmedicinal chemistry
      project: hit-to-lead optimization, featuring lots of\\nde novo heterocycle synthesis.
      I got to cook reactions in molten urea,\\nquench 500 mL of phosphorus oxychloride
      at a time, and even design new\\nroutes (with a little oversight from my postdoc).
      It was awesome.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3b76981-24c3-4bd8-ad10-74ec3bfa0a80_2716x1528.jpeg\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      that nobody needed the\\ncomputer overnight.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nI
      defended my dissertation on June 5th, and cleaned out my hood last\\nweek. For
      the foreseeable future, I'll be a purely computational\\nchemist---computation
      is advancing quickly, and I think that's where I\\nhave the most to offer the
      field right now. But I'll miss the sights and\\nsounds of the lab. There's a
      satisfaction to making a new molecule and\\nholding the final product in your
      hands: the knowledge that you've\\nreshaped this little corner of reality through
      your own actions, and\\nthat this particular arrangement of matter has never
      existed before.\\n\\nAnd simulation is, at the end of the day, only useful insofar
      as it\\nhelps us make real molecules. There may be people who wish to model\\nreactions
      purely for the sake of modeling them, but I am not one of\\nthem. What drew
      me to simulation initially, and what still attracts me\\nto the field today,
      is its potential to help experimental scientists do\\ntheir work faster and
      better. It was easy for me to ensure that this was\\ntrue when I was both doing
      the experiments and running the simulations;\\nmy incentives were aligned properly.
      It will be harder in the future.\\n\\nThere's a seductive appeal in leaving
      lab work behind altogether, too,\\nand one that's dangerous. Any experimentalist
      who's worked with a\\ncomputational collaborator knows that nothing ever works
      precisely as\\nmodeled. There are untold depths of chemical behavior still inaccessible\\nto
      the idealized world of simulation, and it's all too easy for\\ncomputational
      chemists just to look the other way. Life is easier when\\nyou don't have to
      deal with sludgy workups or poorly soluble\\nintermediates, but they don't go
      away just because you can't model them\\nby DFT---reality has a way of keeping
      us honest that simulations\\nfrequently lack.\\n\\nSo, although I bid lab farewell
      at this point in my career, it's a\\nbittersweet parting. I hope to return someday;
      only time will tell.\\n\\n*Thanks to Jacob Thackston for reading a draft of
      this piece.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"130217073\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      of some work from high school, which\\ndoes not in fact make very much sense.
      (I think this is from the Evans\\nproblem set library.)</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nBut
      in high school we had no lab, and thus no practical knowledge. We\\nsplit into
      two groups and tried to come up with experiments for\\nourselves, but the results
      were dismal. Here's the procedure (copied\\nverbatim) for the one and only reaction
      we ran, synthesis of\\nnitrobenzene via nitration of benzene, which was to be
      the first step in\\na multistep synthesis of Kevlar:\\n\\n> In a 250 mL beaker,
      dissolve benzene in a solution of concentrated\\n> H~2~SO~4~ of twice its volume.
      Use an ice-salt bath to bring this\\n> solution to 0 \xB0C or below, and use
      a Pasteur pipette to slowly add a\\n> 1:1 solution of HNO~3~ and H~2~SO~4~ (be
      sure to keep the solution\\n> below 15 degrees Celsius at all times, as the
      reaction is strongly\\n> exothermic). Once all the solution has been added,
      warm it to room\\n> temperature and allow it to sit for 15 minutes.  \\n>   \\n>
      Pour the solution over 50 g of crushed ice in a 250 mL beaker. Once\\n> the
      ice has melted, isolate the product via vacuum filtration via a\\n> Buchner
      funnel and rinse it twice with water and twice with methanol.\\n> Recrystallize
      in a solution of methanol.\\n\\nThe astute observer will notice that there aren't
      very many details\\nhere. How much benzene? How much nitric acid? We didn't
      have the\\nglassware mentioned above---neither a beaker nor a Buchner funnel.
      And,\\nperhaps most damningly, the procedure calls for isolation by filtration,\\nchallenging
      since nitrobenzene is a liquid at room temperature.\\n\\nDespite these problems,
      we successfully ran this reaction (open to air,\\nnot in a fume hood), and obtained
      the product. I vividly recall the\\nyellow bubbles of nitrobenzene floating
      to the top of the vial, and the\\nsmell of cherries that filled the room, a
      smell that returns to me in\\nProustian fashion from time to time when using
      certain reagents. We\\ndidn't have a separatory funnel (or we didn't know how
      to use it if we\\ndid), so we fished some of the nitrobenzene out with a Pasteur
      pipette\\nand threw the rest away.\\n\\nA little bit of knowledge would have
      served us well, as would have\\ngloves and a fume hood. Here's\\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrobenzene):\\n\\n>
      Prolonged exposure \\\\[to nitrobenzene\\\\] may cause serious damage to the\\n>
      central nervous system, impair vision, cause liver or kidney damage,\\n> anemia
      and lung irritation. Inhalation of vapors may induce headache,\\n> nausea, fatigue,
      dizziness, cyanosis, weakness in the arms and legs,\\n> and in rare cases may
      be fatal...  \\n>   \\n> Nitrobenzene is considered a likely human carcinogen
      by the United\\n> States Environmental Protection Agency, and is classified
      by the IARC\\n> as a Group 2B carcinogen which is \\\\\\\"possibly carcinogenic
      to humans\\\\\\\".\\n\\nIndeed, a coworker of mine would later be sent to the
      hospital after\\nspilling nitrobenzene on herself. Surprisingly, my group's
      experiment\\nstill ended up being the safer one---the lab portion of our course
      was\\ndisbanded the following day after my classmates caused an explosion with\\nthionyl
      chloride.\\n\\nI was fortunate enough to land a summer research internship in
      the\\nSessler lab at UT the following summer, and I started studying chemistry\\nin
      earnest: column chromatography, Anslyn/Dougherty, NMR spectroscopy,\\nand all
      the rest. I remember the first reaction I ran at UT:\\nretro-Friedel--Crafts
      dealkylation of a calix\\\\[4\\\\]arene, using about 10\\ng each of phenol and
      aluminum(III) chloride. The brutal physicality of\\nlab work was a nice contrast
      to the gnosticism of software (where I'd\\nworked previously), and I was hooked.\\n\\nI'll
      fast-forward through the more recent parts of my chemical career: I\\nwent to
      MIT and joined the Imperiali lab to work on essentially a\\nmedicinal chemistry
      project: hit-to-lead optimization, featuring lots of\\nde novo heterocycle synthesis.
      I got to cook reactions in molten urea,\\nquench 500 mL of phosphorus oxychloride
      at a time, and even design new\\nroutes (with a little oversight from my postdoc).
      It was awesome.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3b76981-24c3-4bd8-ad10-74ec3bfa0a80_2716x1528.jpeg\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      field right now. But I'll miss the sights and\\nsounds of the lab. There's a
      satisfaction to making a new molecule and\\nholding the final product in your
      hands: the knowledge that you've\\nreshaped this little corner of reality through
      your own actions, and\\nthat this particular arrangement of matter has never
      existed before.\\n\\nAnd simulation is, at the end of the day, only useful insofar
      as it\\nhelps us make real molecules. There may be people who wish to model\\nreactions
      purely for the sake of modeling them, but I am not one of\\nthem. What drew
      me to simulation initially, and what still attracts me\\nto the field today,
      is its potential to help experimental scientists do\\ntheir work faster and
      better. It was easy for me to ensure that this was\\ntrue when I was both doing
      the experiments and running the simulations;\\nmy incentives were aligned properly.
      It will be harder in the future.\\n\\nThere's a seductive appeal in leaving
      lab work behind altogether, too,\\nand one that's dangerous. Any experimentalist
      who's worked with a\\ncomputational collaborator knows that nothing ever works
      precisely as\\nmodeled. There are untold depths of chemical behavior still inaccessible\\nto
      the idealized world of simulation, and it's all too easy for\\ncomputational
      chemists just to look the other way. Life is easier when\\nyou don't have to
      deal with sludgy workups or poorly soluble\\nintermediates, but they don't go
      away just because you can't model them\\nby DFT---reality has a way of keeping
      us honest that simulations\\nfrequently lack.\\n\\nSo, although I bid lab farewell
      at this point in my career, it's a\\nbittersweet parting. I hope to return someday;
      only time will tell.\\n\\n*Thanks to Jacob Thackston for reading a draft of
      this piece.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"130217073\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      recently published a\n[panegyric](https://www.notboring.co/p/varda-the-space-drug-factory)\nabout
      [Varda](https://varda.com/), a startup that''s trying to create\n\"space factories
      making drugs in orbit.\" When I first read this\ndescription, alarm bells went
      off in my head---why would anyone try to\nmake drugs in space? Nevertheless,
      there''s more to this idea than I\ninitially thought. In this piece, I want
      to dig a little deeper into the\nchemistry behind Varda, and discuss some potential
      advantages and\nchallenges of the approach they''re exploring.\n\nMuch of my
      confusion was quickly resolved by realizing that Varda is not\nactually \"making
      drugs in orbit,\" or not in the way that an organic\nchemist would interpret
      that sentence. Varda''s proposal is actually much\nmore specific: they aim to
      crystallize active pharmaceutical ingredients\n(APIs, i.e. finished drug molecules)
      in microgravity, allowing them to\naccess crystal forms and particle size distributions
      which can''t be made\nunder terrestrial conditions. To quote from [their\nwebsite](https://varda.com/wp-content/uploads/varda-info-sheet-mar23_pharmaceutical.pdf):\n\n>
      Varda''s microgravity platform is grounded in decades of proven\n> research
      conducted on NASA''s space stations. By eliminating factors\n> such as natural
      convection and sedimentation, processing in a\n> microgravity environment provides
      a unique path to formulating small\n> molecules and biologics that traditional
      manufacturing processes\n> cannot address. The resulting tunable particle size
      distributions,\n> more ordered crystals, and new forms can lead to improved\n>
      bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual property, and\n> new
      routes of administration.\n\nCrystallization is an excellent target for a new
      and expensive\nmanufacturing process because it''s at once very important and
      very hard\nto control. The goal of crystallization is to grow crystals of a
      given\ncompound, fitting the component molecules together into a perfect\nlattice
      that excludes impurities and can be easily handled. To the best\nof my knowledge,
      almost every small-molecule API is crystallized at one\nstage or another; it''s
      the best way to ensure that the material is\nextremely pure.\n\n(Crystallizing
      proteins for administration is less common, since\nproteins are really difficult
      to crystallize, but it''s not unheard\nof---insulin is often administered subcutaneously
      as a [microcrystalline\nsuspension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22213),\nwhich
      allows higher concentrations to be accessed without excessive\nviscosity.)\n\nBut
      crystallization is also something we can''t really control. We can''t\nphysically
      put molecules into a lattice or force them to adopt ordered\nconfigurations;
      all we can do is dissolve them in some mixture, tweak\nthe conditions a little
      bit, and hope that crystals form. Thus, finding\ngood crystallization conditions
      basically amounts to randomly screening\nsolvents and additives, leaving the
      solutions for a long time, and\nchecking to see if crystals grow. In the words
      of [Derek\nLowe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/voodoo-nominations):\n\n>
      I\\''d like to open up the floor for nominations for the Blackest Art in\n>
      All of Chemistry. And my candidate is a strong, strong contender:\n> crystallization.
      When you go into a protein crystallography lab and\n> see stack after stack
      after stack of plastic trays, each containing\n> scores of different little
      wells, each with a slight variation on the\n> conditions, you realize that you\\''re
      looking at something that we just\n> don\\''t understand very well.\n\nWhy does
      microgravity matter for crystallization? *Not Boring* says that\ncrystallization
      occurs \"at the mesoscopic scale, the length scale on\nwhich objects are larger
      than nanoscale (on the order of atoms and\nmolecules) but still small enough
      that quantum mechanical or other\nnon-trivial ''microscopic'' behavior becomes
      apparent.\" I found this\nanswer a little confusing---doesn''t crystallization
      begin on the\nnanoscale and end on the macroscopic scale?\n\nClearer to me was
      the explanation from a 2001\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cg005511b)
      by Kundrot and\nco-workers:\n\n> In zero gravity, a crystal is subject to Brownian
      motion as on the\n> ground, but unlike the ground case, there is no acceleration
      inducing\n> it to sediment *\\[fall out of solution\\]*. A growing crystal in
      zero\n> gravity will move very little with respect to the surrounding fluid.\n>
      Moreover, as growth units leave solution and are added to the crystal,\n> a
      region of solution depleted in protein is formed. Usually this\n> solution has
      a lower density than the bulk solution and will convect\n> upward in a 1g field
      as seen by Schlerien photography (Figure 1). In\n> zero gravity, the bouyant
      *\\[sic\\]* force is eliminated and no\n> bouyancy-driven convection occurs.
      Because the positions of the\n> crystal and its depletion zone are stable, the
      crystal can grow under\n> conditions where its growing surface is in contact
      with a solution\n> that is only slightly supersaturated. In contrast, the sedimentation\n>
      and convection that occur under 1g place the growing crystal surface\n> in contact
      with bulk solution that is typically several times\n> supersaturated. Lower
      supersaturation at the growing crystal surface\n> allows more high-energy misincorporated
      growth units to disassociate\n> from the crystal before becoming trapped in
      the crystal by the\n> addition of other growth units...  \n>   \n> In short,
      promotion of a stable depletion zone in microgravity is\n> postulated to provide
      a better ordered crystal lattice and benefit the\n> crystal growth process.\n\nTo
      summarize, microgravity serves to immobilize the crystal with respect\nto the
      surrounding solution, preventing convection or sedimentation from\nbringing
      highly concentrated solutions into contact with the crystal.\nThis slows crystal
      growth, which might sound bad but is actually really\ngood: in general, the
      slower a crystal grows, the higher its purity.\n(See also [this 2015\narticle](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav201510)
      for further\ndiscussion.)\n\nWhat practical impact does this have? In most cases,
      crystals grown in\nspace are better than their terrestrial congeners by [a variety
      of\nmetrics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c01056): larger,\nstructurally
      better, and more uniform. To quote from the *Not Boring*\npiece:\n\n> Doing
      crystallization in space is like adding a gravity knob to your\n> instrument---it
      opens up regions of process design space that would\n> otherwise be inaccessible.
      Importantly, after the crystallization\n> occurs in space, the drug retains
      its solid state upon re-entry.\n> Manufacture in space; use on earth.  \n>   \n>
      This is why pharma is going to space to experiment with a wide range\n> of medicines.
      Formulations made in microgravity could open the door to\n> improvements in
      drug shelf life, bioavailability, IP expansion, and\n> even better approaches
      to drug delivery...  \n>   \n> To date, there has been a major disconnect between
      microgravity\n> research and manufacturing. While it''s been possible to hitch
      a ride\n> to the ISS and collaborate with NASA on PCG experiments, there is
      no\n> existing commercial offering to actually manufacture drugs in space.\n>
      Merck used their research results on Keytruda\u00ae crystallization to\n> tinker
      with their terrestrial approaches to formulation. What if they\n> could actually
      just manufacture the crystals they discovered in\n> microgravity at commercial
      scale?  \n>   \n> This is Varda''s mission---to make widespread research and\n>
      manufacturing in microgravity a reality.\n\nOne concern I have is that to date,
      the vast majority of space-based\ncrystallization has been aimed at structural
      biology (elucidating the\nstructure of a protein via crystallography), which
      only takes one\ncrystal, one time. What Varda is aiming to do is preparative\ncrystallography:
      crystallizing proteins and small molecules to isolate\nlarge quantities of them.
      Both processes obviously involve growing\ncrystals, but otherwise they''re pretty
      different: in structural biology,\nall you care about is isolating a single
      large and very pure crystal,\nwhile uniformity and reproducibility are paramount
      in preparative\ncrystallography.\n\nThere''s some precedent for preparative
      protein crystallization in\nmicrogravity: a 1996 Schering-Plough paper studied
      crystallization of\nzinc interferon-\u03b12b on the Space Shuttle. The results
      are excellent:\nover 95% of the protein crystallized, and the resulting suspension\nshowed
      good stability and improved serum half-life in *Cynomolgus*\nmonkeys\n([ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/361/1/139/609196/Macroscale-production-and-analysis-of-crystalline?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\n[ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/387/1/671/811857/Protein-crystal-growth-in-microgravity-review-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).\nThe
      difference in crystal quality is huge:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8847eee5-96ca-44bd-adfa-d84f6cb4d0f8_1236x634.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      crystal size distribution\nunder different conditions.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nOf
      course, until recently access to space was very limited and there\nwasn''t much
      reason to study preparative protein crystallography in\nmicrogravity, so the
      lack of studies is hardly surprising. For all the\nreasons discussed above,
      it seems very likely that preparative\ncrystallography will be generally better
      in microgravity, and that the\nresulting crystals will be more homogenous and
      more pure than the\ncrystals you could grow on Earth. But it''s not 100% certain,
      and that''s\nsomething Varda will have to establish. The word \"can\" is doing
      a lot of\nwork in this text from their website:\n\n> By eliminating factors
      such as natural convection and sedimentation,\n> processing in a microgravity
      environment provides a unique path to\n> formulating small molecules and biologics
      that traditional\n> manufacturing processes cannot address. The resulting tunable

      lead\n> to improved bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual\n>
      property, and new routes of administration *(emphasis added)*\n\nAnother concern
      is that little work (that I''m aware of) has been done on\nsmall molecule crystallization
      in microgravity---the very task Varda\nintends to start with. Small molecules,
      in general, are much easier to\ncrystallize than proteins, and there are more
      parameters for the\nexperimental scientist to tune. While there are certainly
      cases where\nsmall molecule crystals can display unexpected or problematic behaviors\n(like
      the famous case of\n[ritonavir](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011052932607),\nthe
      molecule Varda is investigating first), in general crystallization\nof small
      molecules seems like an easier problem, and one for which there\nare better
      state-of-the-art workarounds.\n\nThe most likely failure mode to me, though,
      is just that microgravity\ncrystallization is better than crystallization on
      Earth, but not that\nmuch better. Shooting APIs into space, waiting for them
      to crystallize,\nand then launching them back to Earth is going to be really
      expensive,\nand Varda will have to demonstrate extraordinary results to justify
      the\nadded hassle---particularly for a technique that they hope to make a key\npart
      of the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Talk about supply\nchain risk!
      (Is this all going to be\n[GMP](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmp)?)\n\nAnd
      it''s worth pointing out a fairly obvious consideration too: what\nVarda is
      proposing to do in space is only one part of a vast, multi-step\noperation.
      No synthesis will take place in space, so all the\nmanufacturing of either proteins
      or small molecules will take place on\nEarth. The purified products will then
      be launched into space,\ncrystallized, and then the crystal-containing solution
      will undergo\nreentry and then be formulated into whatever final form the drug
      needs\nto be administered in.\n\nSo, although \"there are a number of small
      molecules that fetch hundreds\nof thousands or millions of dollars per kg\"
      (*Not Boring*), Varda can\naddress only a small---albeit important---part of
      the manufacturing\nprocess. I doubt this is likely to change. On average, it
      takes\n100--1000 kg of raw materials to manufacture 1 kg of a small molecule\ndrug
      ([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00477)), so\nshipping everything
      to orbit would massively raise costs, without any\nobvious advantages that I
      can think of. The TAM for Varda might be large\nenough to break even, but it''s
      not going to replace conventional\npharmaceutical manufacturing anytime soon.\n\nVarda''s
      pitch is perfect for venture capital: ambitious, risky, and\npotentially game-changing
      if it succeeds. And I wish them luck in their\nquest, since new and better ways
      to approach formulation would be\nawesome. But I can''t shake the nagging doubt
      that they''re so excited\nabout the image of space-based manufacturing that
      they''re trying to\ninvent a problem that their aerospace engineers have a solution
      for.\nWe''ll find out soon enough if they''ve succeeded.\n", "images": [{"src":

      [Varda](https://varda.com/), a startup that's trying to create\\n\\\"space factories
      making drugs in orbit.\\\" When I first read this\\ndescription, alarm bells
      went off in my head---why would anyone try to\\nmake drugs in space? Nevertheless,
      there's more to this idea than I\\ninitially thought. In this piece, I want
      to dig a little deeper into the\\nchemistry behind Varda, and discuss some potential
      advantages and\\nchallenges of the approach they're exploring.\\n\\nMuch of
      my confusion was quickly resolved by realizing that Varda is not\\nactually
      \\\"making drugs in orbit,\\\" or not in the way that an organic\\nchemist would
      interpret that sentence. Varda's proposal is actually much\\nmore specific:
      they aim to crystallize active pharmaceutical ingredients\\n(APIs, i.e. finished
      drug molecules) in microgravity, allowing them to\\naccess crystal forms and
      particle size distributions which can't be made\\nunder terrestrial conditions.
      To quote from [their\\nwebsite](https://varda.com/wp-content/uploads/varda-info-sheet-mar23_pharmaceutical.pdf):\\n\\n>
      Varda's microgravity platform is grounded in decades of proven\\n> research
      conducted on NASA's space stations. By eliminating factors\\n> such as natural
      convection and sedimentation, processing in a\\n> microgravity environment provides
      a unique path to formulating small\\n> molecules and biologics that traditional
      manufacturing processes\\n> cannot address. The resulting tunable particle size
      distributions,\\n> more ordered crystals, and new forms can lead to improved\\n>
      bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual property, and\\n> new
      routes of administration.\\n\\nCrystallization is an excellent target for a
      new and expensive\\nmanufacturing process because it's at once very important
      and very hard\\nto control. The goal of crystallization is to grow crystals
      of a given\\ncompound, fitting the component molecules together into a perfect\\nlattice
      that excludes impurities and can be easily handled. To the best\\nof my knowledge,
      almost every small-molecule API is crystallized at one\\nstage or another; it's
      the best way to ensure that the material is\\nextremely pure.\\n\\n(Crystallizing
      proteins for administration is less common, since\\nproteins are really difficult
      to crystallize, but it's not unheard\\nof---insulin is often administered subcutaneously
      as a [microcrystalline\\nsuspension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22213),\\nwhich
      allows higher concentrations to be accessed without excessive\\nviscosity.)\\n\\nBut
      crystallization is also something we can't really control. We can't\\nphysically
      put molecules into a lattice or force them to adopt ordered\\nconfigurations;
      all we can do is dissolve them in some mixture, tweak\\nthe conditions a little
      bit, and hope that crystals form. Thus, finding\\ngood crystallization conditions
      basically amounts to randomly screening\\nsolvents and additives, leaving the
      solutions for a long time, and\\nchecking to see if crystals grow. In the words
      of [Derek\\nLowe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/voodoo-nominations):\\n\\n>
      I\\\\'d like to open up the floor for nominations for the Blackest Art in\\n>
      All of Chemistry. And my candidate is a strong, strong contender:\\n> crystallization.
      When you go into a protein crystallography lab and\\n> see stack after stack
      after stack of plastic trays, each containing\\n> scores of different little
      wells, each with a slight variation on the\\n> conditions, you realize that
      you\\\\'re looking at something that we just\\n> don\\\\'t understand very well.\\n\\nWhy
      does microgravity matter for crystallization? *Not Boring* says that\\ncrystallization
      occurs \\\"at the mesoscopic scale, the length scale on\\nwhich objects are
      larger than nanoscale (on the order of atoms and\\nmolecules) but still small
      enough that quantum mechanical or other\\nnon-trivial 'microscopic' behavior
      becomes apparent.\\\" I found this\\nanswer a little confusing---doesn't crystallization
      begin on the\\nnanoscale and end on the macroscopic scale?\\n\\nClearer to me
      was the explanation from a 2001\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cg005511b)
      by Kundrot and\\nco-workers:\\n\\n> In zero gravity, a crystal is subject to
      Brownian motion as on the\\n> ground, but unlike the ground case, there is no
      acceleration inducing\\n> it to sediment *\\\\[fall out of solution\\\\]*. A
      growing crystal in zero\\n> gravity will move very little with respect to the
      surrounding fluid.\\n> Moreover, as growth units leave solution and are added
      to the crystal,\\n> a region of solution depleted in protein is formed. Usually
      this\\n> solution has a lower density than the bulk solution and will convect\\n>
      upward in a 1g field as seen by Schlerien photography (Figure 1). In\\n> zero
      gravity, the bouyant *\\\\[sic\\\\]* force is eliminated and no\\n> bouyancy-driven
      convection occurs. Because the positions of the\\n> crystal and its depletion
      zone are stable, the crystal can grow under\\n> conditions where its growing
      surface is in contact with a solution\\n> that is only slightly supersaturated.
      In contrast, the sedimentation\\n> and convection that occur under 1g place
      the growing crystal surface\\n> in contact with bulk solution that is typically
      several times\\n> supersaturated. Lower supersaturation at the growing crystal
      surface\\n> allows more high-energy misincorporated growth units to disassociate\\n>
      from the crystal before becoming trapped in the crystal by the\\n> addition
      of other growth units...  \\n>   \\n> In short, promotion of a stable depletion
      zone in microgravity is\\n> postulated to provide a better ordered crystal lattice
      and benefit the\\n> crystal growth process.\\n\\nTo summarize, microgravity
      serves to immobilize the crystal with respect\\nto the surrounding solution,
      preventing convection or sedimentation from\\nbringing highly concentrated solutions
      into contact with the crystal.\\nThis slows crystal growth, which might sound
      bad but is actually really\\ngood: in general, the slower a crystal grows, the
      higher its purity.\\n(See also [this 2015\\narticle](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav201510)
      for further\\ndiscussion.)\\n\\nWhat practical impact does this have? In most
      cases, crystals grown in\\nspace are better than their terrestrial congeners
      by [a variety of\\nmetrics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c01056):
      larger,\\nstructurally better, and more uniform. To quote from the *Not Boring*\\npiece:\\n\\n>
      Doing crystallization in space is like adding a gravity knob to your\\n> instrument---it
      opens up regions of process design space that would\\n> otherwise be inaccessible.
      Importantly, after the crystallization\\n> occurs in space, the drug retains
      its solid state upon re-entry.\\n> Manufacture in space; use on earth.  \\n>
      \  \\n> This is why pharma is going to space to experiment with a wide range\\n>
      of medicines. Formulations made in microgravity could open the door to\\n> improvements
      in drug shelf life, bioavailability, IP expansion, and\\n> even better approaches
      to drug delivery...  \\n>   \\n> To date, there has been a major disconnect
      between microgravity\\n> research and manufacturing. While it's been possible
      to hitch a ride\\n> to the ISS and collaborate with NASA on PCG experiments,
      there is no\\n> existing commercial offering to actually manufacture drugs in
      space.\\n> Merck used their research results on Keytruda\xAE crystallization
      to\\n> tinker with their terrestrial approaches to formulation. What if they\\n>
      could actually just manufacture the crystals they discovered in\\n> microgravity
      at commercial scale?  \\n>   \\n> This is Varda's mission---to make widespread
      research and\\n> manufacturing in microgravity a reality.\\n\\nOne concern I
      have is that to date, the vast majority of space-based\\ncrystallization has
      been aimed at structural biology (elucidating the\\nstructure of a protein via
      crystallography), which only takes one\\ncrystal, one time. What Varda is aiming
      to do is preparative\\ncrystallography: crystallizing proteins and small molecules
      to isolate\\nlarge quantities of them. Both processes obviously involve growing\\ncrystals,
      but otherwise they're pretty different: in structural biology,\\nall you care
      about is isolating a single large and very pure crystal,\\nwhile uniformity
      and reproducibility are paramount in preparative\\ncrystallography.\\n\\nThere's
      some precedent for preparative protein crystallization in\\nmicrogravity: a
      1996 Schering-Plough paper studied crystallization of\\nzinc interferon-\u03B12b
      on the Space Shuttle. The results are excellent:\\nover 95% of the protein crystallized,
      and the resulting suspension\\nshowed good stability and improved serum half-life
      in *Cynomolgus*\\nmonkeys\\n([ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/361/1/139/609196/Macroscale-production-and-analysis-of-crystalline?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\\n[ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/387/1/671/811857/Protein-crystal-growth-in-microgravity-review-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).\\nThe

      crystal size distribution\\nunder different conditions.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nOf
      course, until recently access to space was very limited and there\\nwasn't much
      reason to study preparative protein crystallography in\\nmicrogravity, so the
      lack of studies is hardly surprising. For all the\\nreasons discussed above,
      it seems very likely that preparative\\ncrystallography will be generally better
      in microgravity, and that the\\nresulting crystals will be more homogenous and
      more pure than the\\ncrystals you could grow on Earth. But it's not 100% certain,
      and that's\\nsomething Varda will have to establish. The word \\\"can\\\" is
      doing a lot of\\nwork in this text from their website:\\n\\n> By eliminating
      factors such as natural convection and sedimentation,\\n> processing in a microgravity
      environment provides a unique path to\\n> formulating small molecules and biologics
      that traditional\\n> manufacturing processes cannot address. The resulting tunable
      particle\\n> size distributions, more ordered crystals, and new forms **can**
      lead\\n> to improved bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual\\n>
      property, and new routes of administration *(emphasis added)*\\n\\nAnother concern
      is that little work (that I'm aware of) has been done on\\nsmall molecule crystallization
      in microgravity---the very task Varda\\nintends to start with. Small molecules,
      in general, are much easier to\\ncrystallize than proteins, and there are more
      parameters for the\\nexperimental scientist to tune. While there are certainly
      cases where\\nsmall molecule crystals can display unexpected or problematic
      behaviors\\n(like the famous case of\\n[ritonavir](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011052932607),\\nthe
      molecule Varda is investigating first), in general crystallization\\nof small
      molecules seems like an easier problem, and one for which there\\nare better
      state-of-the-art workarounds.\\n\\nThe most likely failure mode to me, though,
      is just that microgravity\\ncrystallization is better than crystallization on
      Earth, but not that\\nmuch better. Shooting APIs into space, waiting for them
      to crystallize,\\nand then launching them back to Earth is going to be really
      expensive,\\nand Varda will have to demonstrate extraordinary results to justify
      the\\nadded hassle---particularly for a technique that they hope to make a key\\npart
      of the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Talk about supply\\nchain risk!
      (Is this all going to be\\n[GMP](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmp)?)\\n\\nAnd
      it's worth pointing out a fairly obvious consideration too: what\\nVarda is
      proposing to do in space is only one part of a vast, multi-step\\noperation.
      No synthesis will take place in space, so all the\\nmanufacturing of either
      proteins or small molecules will take place on\\nEarth. The purified products
      will then be launched into space,\\ncrystallized, and then the crystal-containing
      solution will undergo\\nreentry and then be formulated into whatever final form
      the drug needs\\nto be administered in.\\n\\nSo, although \\\"there are a number
      of small molecules that fetch hundreds\\nof thousands or millions of dollars
      per kg\\\" (*Not Boring*), Varda can\\naddress only a small---albeit important---part
      of the manufacturing\\nprocess. I doubt this is likely to change. On average,
      it takes\\n100--1000 kg of raw materials to manufacture 1 kg of a small molecule\\ndrug
      ([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00477)), so\\nshipping everything
      to orbit would massively raise costs, without any\\nobvious advantages that
      I can think of. The TAM for Varda might be large\\nenough to break even, but
      it's not going to replace conventional\\npharmaceutical manufacturing anytime
      soon.\\n\\nVarda's pitch is perfect for venture capital: ambitious, risky, and\\npotentially
      game-changing if it succeeds. And I wish them luck in their\\nquest, since new
      and better ways to approach formulation would be\\nawesome. But I can't shake
      the nagging doubt that they're so excited\\nabout the image of space-based manufacturing
      that they're trying to\\ninvent a problem that their aerospace engineers have
      a solution for.\\nWe'll find out soon enough if they've succeeded.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"128836410\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      particle size distributions which can't be made\\nunder terrestrial conditions.
      To quote from [their\\nwebsite](https://varda.com/wp-content/uploads/varda-info-sheet-mar23_pharmaceutical.pdf):\\n\\n>
      Varda's microgravity platform is grounded in decades of proven\\n> research
      conducted on NASA's space stations. By eliminating factors\\n> such as natural
      convection and sedimentation, processing in a\\n> microgravity environment provides
      a unique path to formulating small\\n> molecules and biologics that traditional
      manufacturing processes\\n> cannot address. The resulting tunable particle size
      distributions,\\n> more ordered crystals, and new forms can lead to improved\\n>
      bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual property, and\\n> new
      routes of administration.\\n\\nCrystallization is an excellent target for a
      new and expensive\\nmanufacturing process because it's at once very important
      and very hard\\nto control. The goal of crystallization is to grow crystals
      of a given\\ncompound, fitting the component molecules together into a perfect\\nlattice
      that excludes impurities and can be easily handled. To the best\\nof my knowledge,
      almost every small-molecule API is crystallized at one\\nstage or another; it's
      the best way to ensure that the material is\\nextremely pure.\\n\\n(Crystallizing
      proteins for administration is less common, since\\nproteins are really difficult
      to crystallize, but it's not unheard\\nof---insulin is often administered subcutaneously
      as a [microcrystalline\\nsuspension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.22213),\\nwhich
      allows higher concentrations to be accessed without excessive\\nviscosity.)\\n\\nBut
      crystallization is also something we can't really control. We can't\\nphysically
      put molecules into a lattice or force them to adopt ordered\\nconfigurations;
      all we can do is dissolve them in some mixture, tweak\\nthe conditions a little
      bit, and hope that crystals form. Thus, finding\\ngood crystallization conditions
      basically amounts to randomly screening\\nsolvents and additives, leaving the
      solutions for a long time, and\\nchecking to see if crystals grow. In the words
      of [Derek\\nLowe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/voodoo-nominations):\\n\\n>
      I\\\\'d like to open up the floor for nominations for the Blackest Art in\\n>
      All of Chemistry. And my candidate is a strong, strong contender:\\n> crystallization.
      When you go into a protein crystallography lab and\\n> see stack after stack
      after stack of plastic trays, each containing\\n> scores of different little
      wells, each with a slight variation on the\\n> conditions, you realize that
      you\\\\'re looking at something that we just\\n> don\\\\'t understand very well.\\n\\nWhy
      does microgravity matter for crystallization? *Not Boring* says that\\ncrystallization
      occurs \\\"at the mesoscopic scale, the length scale on\\nwhich objects are
      larger than nanoscale (on the order of atoms and\\nmolecules) but still small
      enough that quantum mechanical or other\\nnon-trivial 'microscopic' behavior
      becomes apparent.\\\" I found this\\nanswer a little confusing---doesn't crystallization
      begin on the\\nnanoscale and end on the macroscopic scale?\\n\\nClearer to me
      was the explanation from a 2001\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cg005511b)
      by Kundrot and\\nco-workers:\\n\\n> In zero gravity, a crystal is subject to
      Brownian motion as on the\\n> ground, but unlike the ground case, there is no
      acceleration inducing\\n> it to sediment *\\\\[fall out of solution\\\\]*. A
      growing crystal in zero\\n> gravity will move very little with respect to the
      surrounding fluid.\\n> Moreover, as growth units leave solution and are added
      to the crystal,\\n> a region of solution depleted in protein is formed. Usually
      this\\n> solution has a lower density than the bulk solution and will convect\\n>
      upward in a 1g field as seen by Schlerien photography (Figure 1). In\\n> zero
      gravity, the bouyant *\\\\[sic\\\\]* force is eliminated and no\\n> bouyancy-driven
      convection occurs. Because the positions of the\\n> crystal and its depletion
      zone are stable, the crystal can grow under\\n> conditions where its growing
      surface is in contact with a solution\\n> that is only slightly supersaturated.
      In contrast, the sedimentation\\n> and convection that occur under 1g place
      the growing crystal surface\\n> in contact with bulk solution that is typically
      several times\\n> supersaturated. Lower supersaturation at the growing crystal
      surface\\n> allows more high-energy misincorporated growth units to disassociate\\n>
      from the crystal before becoming trapped in the crystal by the\\n> addition
      of other growth units...  \\n>   \\n> In short, promotion of a stable depletion
      zone in microgravity is\\n> postulated to provide a better ordered crystal lattice
      and benefit the\\n> crystal growth process.\\n\\nTo summarize, microgravity
      serves to immobilize the crystal with respect\\nto the surrounding solution,
      preventing convection or sedimentation from\\nbringing highly concentrated solutions
      into contact with the crystal.\\nThis slows crystal growth, which might sound
      bad but is actually really\\ngood: in general, the slower a crystal grows, the
      higher its purity.\\n(See also [this 2015\\narticle](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav201510)
      for further\\ndiscussion.)\\n\\nWhat practical impact does this have? In most
      cases, crystals grown in\\nspace are better than their terrestrial congeners
      by [a variety of\\nmetrics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c01056):
      larger,\\nstructurally better, and more uniform. To quote from the *Not Boring*\\npiece:\\n\\n>
      Doing crystallization in space is like adding a gravity knob to your\\n> instrument---it
      opens up regions of process design space that would\\n> otherwise be inaccessible.
      Importantly, after the crystallization\\n> occurs in space, the drug retains
      its solid state upon re-entry.\\n> Manufacture in space; use on earth.  \\n>
      \  \\n> This is why pharma is going to space to experiment with a wide range\\n>
      of medicines. Formulations made in microgravity could open the door to\\n> improvements
      in drug shelf life, bioavailability, IP expansion, and\\n> even better approaches
      to drug delivery...  \\n>   \\n> To date, there has been a major disconnect
      between microgravity\\n> research and manufacturing. While it's been possible
      to hitch a ride\\n> to the ISS and collaborate with NASA on PCG experiments,
      there is no\\n> existing commercial offering to actually manufacture drugs in
      space.\\n> Merck used their research results on Keytruda\xAE crystallization
      to\\n> tinker with their terrestrial approaches to formulation. What if they\\n>
      could actually just manufacture the crystals they discovered in\\n> microgravity
      at commercial scale?  \\n>   \\n> This is Varda's mission---to make widespread
      research and\\n> manufacturing in microgravity a reality.\\n\\nOne concern I
      have is that to date, the vast majority of space-based\\ncrystallization has
      been aimed at structural biology (elucidating the\\nstructure of a protein via
      crystallography), which only takes one\\ncrystal, one time. What Varda is aiming
      to do is preparative\\ncrystallography: crystallizing proteins and small molecules
      to isolate\\nlarge quantities of them. Both processes obviously involve growing\\ncrystals,
      but otherwise they're pretty different: in structural biology,\\nall you care
      about is isolating a single large and very pure crystal,\\nwhile uniformity
      and reproducibility are paramount in preparative\\ncrystallography.\\n\\nThere's
      some precedent for preparative protein crystallization in\\nmicrogravity: a
      1996 Schering-Plough paper studied crystallization of\\nzinc interferon-\u03B12b
      on the Space Shuttle. The results are excellent:\\nover 95% of the protein crystallized,
      and the resulting suspension\\nshowed good stability and improved serum half-life
      in *Cynomolgus*\\nmonkeys\\n([ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/361/1/139/609196/Macroscale-production-and-analysis-of-crystalline?redirectedFrom=fulltext),\\n[ref](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/387/1/671/811857/Protein-crystal-growth-in-microgravity-review-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).\\nThe

      course, until recently access to space was very limited and there\\nwasn't much
      reason to study preparative protein crystallography in\\nmicrogravity, so the
      lack of studies is hardly surprising. For all the\\nreasons discussed above,
      it seems very likely that preparative\\ncrystallography will be generally better
      in microgravity, and that the\\nresulting crystals will be more homogenous and
      more pure than the\\ncrystals you could grow on Earth. But it's not 100% certain,
      and that's\\nsomething Varda will have to establish. The word \\\"can\\\" is
      doing a lot of\\nwork in this text from their website:\\n\\n> By eliminating
      factors such as natural convection and sedimentation,\\n> processing in a microgravity
      environment provides a unique path to\\n> formulating small molecules and biologics
      that traditional\\n> manufacturing processes cannot address. The resulting tunable
      particle\\n> size distributions, more ordered crystals, and new forms **can**
      lead\\n> to improved bioavailability, extended shelf-life, new intellectual\\n>
      property, and new routes of administration *(emphasis added)*\\n\\nAnother concern
      is that little work (that I'm aware of) has been done on\\nsmall molecule crystallization
      in microgravity---the very task Varda\\nintends to start with. Small molecules,
      in general, are much easier to\\ncrystallize than proteins, and there are more
      parameters for the\\nexperimental scientist to tune. While there are certainly
      cases where\\nsmall molecule crystals can display unexpected or problematic
      behaviors\\n(like the famous case of\\n[ritonavir](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011052932607),\\nthe
      molecule Varda is investigating first), in general crystallization\\nof small
      molecules seems like an easier problem, and one for which there\\nare better
      state-of-the-art workarounds.\\n\\nThe most likely failure mode to me, though,
      is just that microgravity\\ncrystallization is better than crystallization on
      Earth, but not that\\nmuch better. Shooting APIs into space, waiting for them
      to crystallize,\\nand then launching them back to Earth is going to be really
      expensive,\\nand Varda will have to demonstrate extraordinary results to justify
      the\\nadded hassle---particularly for a technique that they hope to make a key\\npart
      of the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. Talk about supply\\nchain risk!
      (Is this all going to be\\n[GMP](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmp)?)\\n\\nAnd
      it's worth pointing out a fairly obvious consideration too: what\\nVarda is
      proposing to do in space is only one part of a vast, multi-step\\noperation.
      No synthesis will take place in space, so all the\\nmanufacturing of either
      proteins or small molecules will take place on\\nEarth. The purified products
      will then be launched into space,\\ncrystallized, and then the crystal-containing
      solution will undergo\\nreentry and then be formulated into whatever final form
      the drug needs\\nto be administered in.\\n\\nSo, although \\\"there are a number
      of small molecules that fetch hundreds\\nof thousands or millions of dollars
      per kg\\\" (*Not Boring*), Varda can\\naddress only a small---albeit important---part
      of the manufacturing\\nprocess. I doubt this is likely to change. On average,
      it takes\\n100--1000 kg of raw materials to manufacture 1 kg of a small molecule\\ndrug
      ([ref](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00477)), so\\nshipping everything
      to orbit would massively raise costs, without any\\nobvious advantages that
      I can think of. The TAM for Varda might be large\\nenough to break even, but
      it's not going to replace conventional\\npharmaceutical manufacturing anytime
      soon.\\n\\nVarda's pitch is perfect for venture capital: ambitious, risky, and\\npotentially
      game-changing if it succeeds. And I wish them luck in their\\nquest, since new
      and better ways to approach formulation would be\\nawesome. But I can't shake
      the nagging doubt that they're so excited\\nabout the image of space-based manufacturing
      that they're trying to\\ninvent a problem that their aerospace engineers have
      a solution for.\\nWe'll find out soon enough if they've succeeded.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"128836410\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      Available Compounds**\n\nThe number of compounds available for purchase has
      markedly increased in\nrecent years. In the 1950s, the Aldrich Chemical Company''s
      listings\ncould fit on a single page, and even by the 1970s Sigma-Aldrich only\nsold
      40,000 or so chemicals\n([source](https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/sigma-aldrich)).\n\nBut
      things have changed. Nowadays new reagents are available for\npurchase within
      weeks or months of being reported\n([e.g.](https://enamine.net/news-press-releases/press-releases/1286-enamine-brings-levin-nitrogen-deleting-reagent-to-the-market)),\nand
      companies like Enamine spend all their time devising new and quirky\nstructures
      for medicinal chemists to buy.\n\nOne way to quantify how many compounds are
      for sale today is through[the\nZINC database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database),

      to perform conformational searches and\nhigh-accuracy quantum chemical calculations
      on catalyst\u2022substrate\ncomplexes with this degree of flexibility would
      astonish anyone from the\npast. (To be fair to computational chemists, it''s
      not all Moore''s\nLaw---advances in QM tooling also play a big role.)\n\n###
      **What Now?**\n\nThere are lots of advances that I haven''t even covered, like
      the general\nimprovement in synthetic methodology and the rise of robotics.\nNevertheless,
      I think the trend is clear: it''s easier to acquire data\nthan it''s ever been.\n\nWhat,
      then, do we do with all this data? Most of the time, the answer\nseems to be
      \"not much.\" [A recent\neditorial](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03246)
      by\nMarisa Kozlowski observes that the average number of substrates in\n*Organic
      Letters* has increased from 17 in 2009 to 40 in 2021, even as\nthe information
      contained in these papers has largely remained constant.\nFilling a substrate
      scope with almost identical compounds is a boring\nway to use more data; we
      can do better.\n\nThe availability of cheap data means that scientists can---and\nmust---start
      thinking about new ways to approach experimental design.\nLots of academic scientists
      still labor under the delusion that\n\"hypothesis-driven science\" is somehow
      superior to HTE, when in fact the\ntwo are ideal complements to one another.
      \"Thinking in 96-well plates\"\nis already common in industry, and should become
      more common in\nacademia; why run a single reaction when you can run a whole
      screen?\n\nNew tools are needed to design panels, run reactions, and analyze
      the\nresultant data. One nice entry into this space is Tim Cernak''s\n*[phactor](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c75166702a9bcd6918bf39)*,\na
      software package for high-throughput experimentation, and I''m sure\nlots more
      tools will spring up in the years to come. (I''m also\noptimistic that multi-substrate
      screening, which we and others have used\nin \"screening for generality,\" will
      become more widely adopted as HTE\nbecomes more commonplace.)\n\nThe real worry,
      though, is that we will refuse to change our paradigms\nand just use all these
      improvements to publish old-style papers faster.\nAll the technological breakthroughs
      in the world won''t do anything to\naccelerate scientific progress if we refuse
      to open our eyes to the\npossibilities they create. If present trends continue,
      it may be\npossible in 5--10 years to screen for a hit one week, optimize reaction\nconditions
      the next week, and run the substrate scope on the third week.\nDo we really
      want a world in which every methodology graduate student is\nexpected to produce
      10--12 low-quality papers per year?\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb79cbc61-7d10-45e2-86d8-5006ac9e83f7_720x620.png",

      **Commercially Available Compounds**\\n\\nThe number of compounds available
      for purchase has markedly increased in\\nrecent years. In the 1950s, the Aldrich
      Chemical Company's listings\\ncould fit on a single page, and even by the 1970s
      Sigma-Aldrich only\\nsold 40,000 or so chemicals\\n([source](https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/sigma-aldrich)).\\n\\nBut
      things have changed. Nowadays new reagents are available for\\npurchase within
      weeks or months of being reported\\n([e.g.](https://enamine.net/news-press-releases/press-releases/1286-enamine-brings-levin-nitrogen-deleting-reagent-to-the-market)),\\nand
      companies like Enamine spend all their time devising new and quirky\\nstructures
      for medicinal chemists to buy.\\n\\nOne way to quantify how many compounds are
      for sale today is through[the\\nZINC database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database),
      aimed at\\ncollecting compounds for virtual screening, which is updated every
      few\\nyears or so. The first iteration of ZINC, in 2005, had fewer than a\\nmillion
      compounds: now there are almost 40 billion:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d35390d-7e6f-4588-8351-24dbd88ce9e2_813x813.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      now routine to perform conformational searches and\\nhigh-accuracy quantum chemical
      calculations on catalyst\u2022substrate\\ncomplexes with this degree of flexibility
      would astonish anyone from the\\npast. (To be fair to computational chemists,
      it's not all Moore's\\nLaw---advances in QM tooling also play a big role.)\\n\\n###
      **What Now?**\\n\\nThere are lots of advances that I haven't even covered, like
      the general\\nimprovement in synthetic methodology and the rise of robotics.\\nNevertheless,
      I think the trend is clear: it's easier to acquire data\\nthan it's ever been.\\n\\nWhat,
      then, do we do with all this data? Most of the time, the answer\\nseems to be
      \\\"not much.\\\" [A recent\\neditorial](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03246)
      by\\nMarisa Kozlowski observes that the average number of substrates in\\n*Organic
      Letters* has increased from 17 in 2009 to 40 in 2021, even as\\nthe information
      contained in these papers has largely remained constant.\\nFilling a substrate
      scope with almost identical compounds is a boring\\nway to use more data; we
      can do better.\\n\\nThe availability of cheap data means that scientists can---and\\nmust---start
      thinking about new ways to approach experimental design.\\nLots of academic
      scientists still labor under the delusion that\\n\\\"hypothesis-driven science\\\"
      is somehow superior to HTE, when in fact the\\ntwo are ideal complements to
      one another. \\\"Thinking in 96-well plates\\\"\\nis already common in industry,
      and should become more common in\\nacademia; why run a single reaction when
      you can run a whole screen?\\n\\nNew tools are needed to design panels, run
      reactions, and analyze the\\nresultant data. One nice entry into this space
      is Tim Cernak's\\n*[phactor](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c75166702a9bcd6918bf39)*,\\na
      software package for high-throughput experimentation, and I'm sure\\nlots more
      tools will spring up in the years to come. (I'm also\\noptimistic that multi-substrate
      screening, which we and others have used\\nin \\\"screening for generality,\\\"
      will become more widely adopted as HTE\\nbecomes more commonplace.)\\n\\nThe
      real worry, though, is that we will refuse to change our paradigms\\nand just
      use all these improvements to publish old-style papers faster.\\nAll the technological
      breakthroughs in the world won't do anything to\\naccelerate scientific progress
      if we refuse to open our eyes to the\\npossibilities they create. If present
      trends continue, it may be\\npossible in 5--10 years to screen for a hit one
      week, optimize reaction\\nconditions the next week, and run the substrate scope
      on the third week.\\nDo we really want a world in which every methodology graduate
      student is\\nexpected to produce 10--12 low-quality papers per year?\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"125587417\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      **Commercially Available Compounds**\\n\\nThe number of compounds available
      for purchase has markedly increased in\\nrecent years. In the 1950s, the Aldrich
      Chemical Company's listings\\ncould fit on a single page, and even by the 1970s
      Sigma-Aldrich only\\nsold 40,000 or so chemicals\\n([source](https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/sigma-aldrich)).\\n\\nBut
      things have changed. Nowadays new reagents are available for\\npurchase within
      weeks or months of being reported\\n([e.g.](https://enamine.net/news-press-releases/press-releases/1286-enamine-brings-levin-nitrogen-deleting-reagent-to-the-market)),\\nand
      companies like Enamine spend all their time devising new and quirky\\nstructures
      for medicinal chemists to buy.\\n\\nOne way to quantify how many compounds are
      for sale today is through[the\\nZINC database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database),
      aimed at\\ncollecting compounds for virtual screening, which is updated every
      few\\nyears or so. The first iteration of ZINC, in 2005, had fewer than a\\nmillion
      compounds: now there are almost 40 billion:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d35390d-7e6f-4588-8351-24dbd88ce9e2_813x813.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      now routine to perform conformational searches and\\nhigh-accuracy quantum chemical
      calculations on catalyst\u2022substrate\\ncomplexes with this degree of flexibility
      would astonish anyone from the\\npast. (To be fair to computational chemists,
      it's not all Moore's\\nLaw---advances in QM tooling also play a big role.)\\n\\n###
      **What Now?**\\n\\nThere are lots of advances that I haven't even covered, like
      the general\\nimprovement in synthetic methodology and the rise of robotics.\\nNevertheless,
      I think the trend is clear: it's easier to acquire data\\nthan it's ever been.\\n\\nWhat,
      then, do we do with all this data? Most of the time, the answer\\nseems to be
      \\\"not much.\\\" [A recent\\neditorial](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03246)
      by\\nMarisa Kozlowski observes that the average number of substrates in\\n*Organic
      Letters* has increased from 17 in 2009 to 40 in 2021, even as\\nthe information
      contained in these papers has largely remained constant.\\nFilling a substrate
      scope with almost identical compounds is a boring\\nway to use more data; we
      can do better.\\n\\nThe availability of cheap data means that scientists can---and\\nmust---start
      thinking about new ways to approach experimental design.\\nLots of academic
      scientists still labor under the delusion that\\n\\\"hypothesis-driven science\\\"
      is somehow superior to HTE, when in fact the\\ntwo are ideal complements to
      one another. \\\"Thinking in 96-well plates\\\"\\nis already common in industry,
      and should become more common in\\nacademia; why run a single reaction when
      you can run a whole screen?\\n\\nNew tools are needed to design panels, run
      reactions, and analyze the\\nresultant data. One nice entry into this space
      is Tim Cernak's\\n*[phactor](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c75166702a9bcd6918bf39)*,\\na
      software package for high-throughput experimentation, and I'm sure\\nlots more
      tools will spring up in the years to come. (I'm also\\noptimistic that multi-substrate
      screening, which we and others have used\\nin \\\"screening for generality,\\\"
      will become more widely adopted as HTE\\nbecomes more commonplace.)\\n\\nThe
      real worry, though, is that we will refuse to change our paradigms\\nand just
      use all these improvements to publish old-style papers faster.\\nAll the technological
      breakthroughs in the world won't do anything to\\naccelerate scientific progress
      if we refuse to open our eyes to the\\npossibilities they create. If present
      trends continue, it may be\\npossible in 5--10 years to screen for a hit one
      week, optimize reaction\\nconditions the next week, and run the substrate scope
      on the third week.\\nDo we really want a world in which every methodology graduate
      student is\\nexpected to produce 10--12 low-quality papers per year?\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"125587417\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "Recently,
      I wrote about [how scientists could stand to learn a lot from\nthe tech\nindustry.](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230502_startups.html)\nIn
      that spirit, today I want to share a book review of *Chaos Monkeys:\nObscene
      Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley*, Antonio Garc\u00eda\nMart\u00ednez''s
      best-selling memoir about his time in tech and \"a guide to\nthe spirit of Silicon
      Valley\"\n([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/business/dealbook/review-chaos-monkeys-is-a-guide-to-the-spirit-of-silicon-valley.html)).\n\n*Chaos
      Monkeys* is one of the most literary memoirs I''ve read. The book\nitself is
      a clear homage to Hunter S. Thompson''s *Fear and Loathing in\nLas Vegas*; Mart\u00ednez
      writes in the \"gonzo journalism\" style, blending\nlarger-than-life personal
      exploits with frank accounting of the facts.\nBut Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez''s
      writing, replete with GRE-level words and\nclassical epigraphs, invites further
      literary comparisons.\n\n## ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***The Odyssey***\n\nThe
      first comparison that springs to mind is *The Odyssey*. Odysseus,\nthe protagonist
      of The Odyssey, is frequently described as *polytropos*\n(lit. \"many turns\"),
      which denotes his wily and cunning nature. Antonio\nGarc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez
      (or, per the tech fondness for acronyms, \"AGM\")\ncertainly deserves the same
      epithet.\n\n*Chaos Monkeys* is structured as a recounting of AGM''s escapades
      in\nSilicon Valley. In order, he (1) leaves his job at Goldman Sachs and\njoins
      an ad-tech company, (2) quits and founds his own company, AdGrok,\n(3) gets
      accepted to Y Combinator and survives a lengthy legal battle\nwith his former
      employer, (4) sells AdGrok simultaneously to both\nTwitter and Facebook, eventually
      sending the other employees to Twitter\nand himself to Facebook, (5) becomes
      a PM at Facebook and engineers a\nscheme to fix their ad platform and make them
      profitable, (6) succeeds,\nsorta, but pisses people off and gets fired, and
      then (7) turns around\nand sells his expertise to Twitter.\n\nHis circuitous
      journey around the Bay Area has the rough form of an\nancient epic: at each
      company, he''s faced with new challenges and new\nadversaries, and his fractious
      relationships with his superiors mean\nthat he''s often at the mercy of capricious
      higher powers, not unlike\nOdysseus. Nevertheless, through a mixture of cunning
      and hard work he\nmanages to escape with his skin intact every time, ready for
      the next\nepisode. (And, best of all, he literally lives on a boat while working\nat
      Facebook.)\n\n(His escapades have only continued since this book was published:
      he got\nhired at Apple, unceremoniously fired a few weeks later \\[for passages\nin
      *Chaos Monkeys*\\], made it on [Joe\nRogan](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2JMZ0yOuTaGU3bXLymlWYT),
      and has\nnow founded [spindl](https://www.spindl.xyz/), a web3 ad-tech startup,\nwhile
      simultaneously [converting to\nJudaism](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/why-judaism).)\n\n##
      ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***Moby-Dick***\n\n*Chaos Monkeys* bears a structural
      resemblance to *Moby-Dick*. Narrative\npassages alternate with lengthy technical
      discussions about the minutiae\nof Silicon Valley: one chapter, you''re reading
      about how AGM flooded\nMark Zuckerberg''s office trying to brew beer inside
      Facebook, while the\nnext chapter is devoted to a discussion of how demand-side
      advertising\nplatforms work.\n\nThe similarities run deeper, though. Venture
      capitalism, the funding\nmodel that dominates Silicon Valley, was originally
      developed to fund\nwhaling expeditions in the 1800s\n([ref](https://newrepublic.com/article/154490/small-world-vc),\n[ref](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43322)).
      While\nonce venture capitalists listened to prospective whaling captains\nadvertising
      the quality of their crews in a New England tavern, today\nVCs hear pitches
      from thousands of startups hoping to develop ~~the next\nkiller app~~ the best
      ChatGPT frontend and make millions.\n\nThis isn''t a coincidence: whaling expeditions
      and tech startups are both\nhigh-risk, high-reward enterprises that require
      an incredible amount of\nskill and hard work, but also a healthy dose of luck.
      Both operations\nhave returns dominated by outliers, making picking winners
      much more\nimportant than making safe bets, and in both cases the investment\nremains
      illiquid for a long time, demanding trust from the investor.\n\nMuch like Ishmael
      in *Moby-Dick*, AGM''s adventures see him join forces\nwith a motley crew of
      high-performing misfits from around the globe. And\njust as Ahab''s quest for
      the whale is foreshadowed to be a ruinous one,\nso too does the reader quickly
      come to understand that AGM''s tenure in\nSilicon Valley will not, ultimately,
      end well. A fatalistic haze hangs\nover the book, coloring his various hijinks
      with a sense of impending\nloss.\n\n(And did I mention he lives on a boat?)\n\n##
      ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***The Great Gatsby***\n\nThe emotional tone of the
      book, however, is best compared to that\nfavorite of high-school English classes,
      *The Great Gatsby*. AGM, like\nNick Carraway, is an outsider in the world of
      the nouveau\nriche---opulent parties, high-speed road races, conspicuous\nconsumption---and,
      over the course of the book, is alternately\ninfatuated with and disgusted by
      his surroundings. When at last AGM\nretires to a quiet life on ~~Ithaca~~ the
      San Juan islands, it''s with\nfeelings of disillusionment, betrayal, and frustration,
      not unlike\nCarraway withdrawing to the Midwest. As AGM writes in the penultimate\nparagraph
      of *Chaos Monkeys*''s acknowledgements:\n\n> To Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston,
      Sam Altman, and the rest of the Y\n> Combinator partners and founders involved
      in the AdGrok saga. In a\n> Valley world awash with mammoth greed and opportunism
      masquerading as\n> beneficent innovation, you were the only real loyalty and
      idealism I\n> ever encountered.\n\nBut *Chaos Monkeys* isn''t solely an indictment
      of Silicon Valley''s worst\nexcesses. Not unlike *The Wire*, *Chaos Monkeys*
      manages to\nsimultaneously portray the positive and negative aspects of its
      subject\nmatter, refusing to be reduced to \"tech good\" or \"tech bad.\" The
      panoply\nof grifters, Dilbert-tier bosses, and Machiavellian sociopaths lambasted\nby
      AGM can exist only because of the immense value that their\nenterprises provide
      to society---and his faith in the ability of tech to\ncreate wonders persists
      even as his own efforts to do so are undermined.\n\nSo the underlying message
      of *Chaos Monkeys*, ultimately, is one of hope\nfor tech. If the excesses of
      tech are worse than other industries, it\\''s\nonly because the underlying field
      itself is so much more fertile. Far\nfrom condemning it, the depths of the decadence
      spawned by Silicon\nValley bear witness to the immense value it creates. Imitation
      is the\nhighest form of flattery; grift is the surest sign of productivity.\n\nOverall,
      *Chaos Monkeys* is an exhilarating and hilarious read, a gentle\nintroduction
      to the world of term sheets, product managers, and\nnon-competes, and a book
      replete with anecdotes sure to fulfill the\nstereotypes of tech-lovers and tech-haters
      alike.\n", "images": [], "updated_at": 1685453846, "published_at": 1685453846,

      Monkeys* is one of the most literary memoirs I've read. The book\\nitself is
      a clear homage to Hunter S. Thompson's *Fear and Loathing in\\nLas Vegas*; Mart\xEDnez
      writes in the \\\"gonzo journalism\\\" style, blending\\nlarger-than-life personal
      exploits with frank accounting of the facts.\\nBut Antonio Garc\xEDa Mart\xEDnez's
      writing, replete with GRE-level words and\\nclassical epigraphs, invites further
      literary comparisons.\\n\\n## ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***The Odyssey***\\n\\nThe
      first comparison that springs to mind is *The Odyssey*. Odysseus,\\nthe protagonist
      of The Odyssey, is frequently described as *polytropos*\\n(lit. \\\"many turns\\\"),
      which denotes his wily and cunning nature. Antonio\\nGarc\xEDa Mart\xEDnez (or,
      per the tech fondness for acronyms, \\\"AGM\\\")\\ncertainly deserves the same
      epithet.\\n\\n*Chaos Monkeys* is structured as a recounting of AGM's escapades
      in\\nSilicon Valley. In order, he (1) leaves his job at Goldman Sachs and\\njoins
      an ad-tech company, (2) quits and founds his own company, AdGrok,\\n(3) gets
      accepted to Y Combinator and survives a lengthy legal battle\\nwith his former
      employer, (4) sells AdGrok simultaneously to both\\nTwitter and Facebook, eventually
      sending the other employees to Twitter\\nand himself to Facebook, (5) becomes
      a PM at Facebook and engineers a\\nscheme to fix their ad platform and make
      them profitable, (6) succeeds,\\nsorta, but pisses people off and gets fired,
      and then (7) turns around\\nand sells his expertise to Twitter.\\n\\nHis circuitous
      journey around the Bay Area has the rough form of an\\nancient epic: at each
      company, he's faced with new challenges and new\\nadversaries, and his fractious
      relationships with his superiors mean\\nthat he's often at the mercy of capricious
      higher powers, not unlike\\nOdysseus. Nevertheless, through a mixture of cunning
      and hard work he\\nmanages to escape with his skin intact every time, ready
      for the next\\nepisode. (And, best of all, he literally lives on a boat while
      working\\nat Facebook.)\\n\\n(His escapades have only continued since this book

      ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***Moby-Dick***\\n\\n*Chaos Monkeys* bears a structural
      resemblance to *Moby-Dick*. Narrative\\npassages alternate with lengthy technical
      discussions about the minutiae\\nof Silicon Valley: one chapter, you're reading
      about how AGM flooded\\nMark Zuckerberg's office trying to brew beer inside
      Facebook, while the\\nnext chapter is devoted to a discussion of how demand-side
      advertising\\nplatforms work.\\n\\nThe similarities run deeper, though. Venture
      capitalism, the funding\\nmodel that dominates Silicon Valley, was originally
      developed to fund\\nwhaling expeditions in the 1800s\\n([ref](https://newrepublic.com/article/154490/small-world-vc),\\n[ref](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=43322)).
      While\\nonce venture capitalists listened to prospective whaling captains\\nadvertising
      the quality of their crews in a New England tavern, today\\nVCs hear pitches
      from thousands of startups hoping to develop ~~the next\\nkiller app~~ the best
      ChatGPT frontend and make millions.\\n\\nThis isn't a coincidence: whaling expeditions
      and tech startups are both\\nhigh-risk, high-reward enterprises that require
      an incredible amount of\\nskill and hard work, but also a healthy dose of luck.
      Both operations\\nhave returns dominated by outliers, making picking winners
      much more\\nimportant than making safe bets, and in both cases the investment\\nremains
      illiquid for a long time, demanding trust from the investor.\\n\\nMuch like
      Ishmael in *Moby-Dick*, AGM's adventures see him join forces\\nwith a motley
      crew of high-performing misfits from around the globe. And\\njust as Ahab's
      quest for the whale is foreshadowed to be a ruinous one,\\nso too does the reader
      quickly come to understand that AGM's tenure in\\nSilicon Valley will not, ultimately,
      end well. A fatalistic haze hangs\\nover the book, coloring his various hijinks
      with a sense of impending\\nloss.\\n\\n(And did I mention he lives on a boat?)\\n\\n##
      ***Chaos Monkeys*** **as** ***The Great Gatsby***\\n\\nThe emotional tone of
      the book, however, is best compared to that\\nfavorite of high-school English
      classes, *The Great Gatsby*. AGM, like\\nNick Carraway, is an outsider in the
      world of the nouveau\\nriche---opulent parties, high-speed road races, conspicuous\\nconsumption---and,
      over the course of the book, is alternately\\ninfatuated with and disgusted
      by his surroundings. When at last AGM\\nretires to a quiet life on ~~Ithaca~~
      the San Juan islands, it's with\\nfeelings of disillusionment, betrayal, and
      frustration, not unlike\\nCarraway withdrawing to the Midwest. As AGM writes
      in the penultimate\\nparagraph of *Chaos Monkeys*'s acknowledgements:\\n\\n>
      To Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Sam Altman, and the rest of the Y\\n> Combinator
      partners and founders involved in the AdGrok saga. In a\\n> Valley world awash
      with mammoth greed and opportunism masquerading as\\n> beneficent innovation,
      you were the only real loyalty and idealism I\\n> ever encountered.\\n\\nBut
      *Chaos Monkeys* isn't solely an indictment of Silicon Valley's worst\\nexcesses.
      Not unlike *The Wire*, *Chaos Monkeys* manages to\\nsimultaneously portray the
      positive and negative aspects of its subject\\nmatter, refusing to be reduced
      to \\\"tech good\\\" or \\\"tech bad.\\\" The panoply\\nof grifters, Dilbert-tier
      bosses, and Machiavellian sociopaths lambasted\\nby AGM can exist only because
      of the immense value that their\\nenterprises provide to society---and his faith
      in the ability of tech to\\ncreate wonders persists even as his own efforts
      to do so are undermined.\\n\\nSo the underlying message of *Chaos Monkeys*,
      ultimately, is one of hope\\nfor tech. If the excesses of tech are worse than
      other industries, it\\\\'s\\nonly because the underlying field itself is so
      much more fertile. Far\\nfrom condemning it, the depths of the decadence spawned
      by Silicon\\nValley bear witness to the immense value it creates. Imitation
      is the\\nhighest form of flattery; grift is the surest sign of productivity.\\n\\nOverall,
      *Chaos Monkeys* is an exhilarating and hilarious read, a gentle\\nintroduction
      to the world of term sheets, product managers, and\\nnon-competes, and a book
      replete with anecdotes sure to fulfill the\\nstereotypes of tech-lovers and
      tech-haters alike.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"124806772\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "Previously,
      I wrote about various [potential future roles for\njournals](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230427_journals.html).\nSeveral
      of the scenarios I discussed involved journals taking a much\nbigger role as
      editors and custodians of science, using their power to\nshape the way that
      science is conducted and exerting control over the\nscientific process.\n\nI
      was thus intrigued when, last week, *The Journal of Chemical\nInformation and
      Modeling* (*JCIM*; an ACS journal) released [a set of\nguidelines](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00599)
      for\nmolecular dynamics simulations that future publications must comply\nwith.
      These guidelines [provoked a reaction from the\ncommunity](https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen/status/1659889905843990529):\nvarious
      provisions (like the requirement that all simulations be\nperformed in triplicate)
      were alleged to be\n[arbitrary](https://twitter.com/PabloGalazDavis/status/1659940766330781696)\nor\n[unscientific](https://twitter.com/PiiaBartos/status/1659976208015130626),\nand
      the fact that these standards were imposed by editors and not\ndetermined by
      the community also [drew\ncriticism](https://twitter.com/daviddesancho/status/1660184730862583808).\n\nThe
      authors\n[say](https://twitter.com/RommieAmaro/status/1660050832157716481) that\nthe
      editorial \"is \\*not\\* intended to instruct on how to run MD\", but\nthis
      defense rings hollow to me. See, for instance, the section about\nchoosing force
      fields:\n\n> JCIM will not accept simulations with old force field versions
      unless\n> a clear justification is provided. Specialized force fields should
      be\n> used when available (e.g., for intrinsically disordered proteins). In\n>
      the case of the reparametrization or development of new parameters\n> compatible
      with a given force field, please provide benchmark data to\n> support the actual
      need for reparameterization, proper validation of\n> novel parameters against
      experimental or high-level QM data...\n\nI''m not a molecular dynamics expert,
      so I''m happy to stay out of the\nscientific side of things (although the editorial''s
      claim that \"MD\nsimulations are not suitable to sample events occurring between
      free\nenergy barriers\" seems clearly false for sufficiently low-barrier\nprocesses).
      Nor do I wish to overstate the size of the community''s\nreaction: a few people
      complaining on Twitter doesn''t really matter.\n\nRather, I want to use this
      vignette to reflect on the nature of\nscientific authority, and return to a
      piece I''ve cited\n[before](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html):\nGeoff
      Anders'' [\"The Transformations of\nScience.\"](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)\nAnders
      describes how the enterprise of science, initially intended to be\nfree from
      authority, has evolved into a magisterium of knowledge that\ngovernments, corporations,
      and laypeople rely upon:\n\n> The original ideal of *nullius in verba* sometimes

      editors and custodians of science, using their power to\nshape the way that
      science is conducted and exerting control over the\nscientific process.\n\nI
      was thus intrigued when, last week, *The Journal of Chemical\nInformation and
      Modeling* (*JCIM*; an ACS journal) released [a set of\nguidelines](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00599)
      for\nmolecular dynamics simulations that future publications must comply\nwith.
      These guidelines [provoked a reaction from the\ncommunity](https://twitter.com/LindorffLarsen/status/1659889905843990529):\nvarious
      provisions (like the requirement that all simulations be\nperformed in triplicate)
      were alleged to be\n[arbitrary](https://twitter.com/PabloGalazDavis/status/1659940766330781696)\nor\n[unscientific](https://twitter.com/PiiaBartos/status/1659976208015130626),\nand
      the fact that these standards were imposed by editors and not\ndetermined by
      the community also [drew\ncriticism](https://twitter.com/daviddesancho/status/1660184730862583808).\n\nThe
      authors\n[say](https://twitter.com/RommieAmaro/status/1660050832157716481) that\nthe
      editorial \"is \\*not\\* intended to instruct on how to run MD\", but\nthis
      defense rings hollow to me. See, for instance, the section about\nchoosing force
      fields:\n\n> JCIM will not accept simulations with old force field versions
      unless\n> a clear justification is provided. Specialized force fields should
      be\n> used when available (e.g., for intrinsically disordered proteins). In\n>

      need for reparameterization, proper validation of\n> novel parameters against
      experimental or high-level QM data...\n\nI''m not a molecular dynamics expert,
      so I''m happy to stay out of the\nscientific side of things (although the editorial''s
      claim that \"MD\nsimulations are not suitable to sample events occurring between
      free\nenergy barriers\" seems clearly false for sufficiently low-barrier\nprocesses).
      Nor do I wish to overstate the size of the community''s\nreaction: a few people
      complaining on Twitter doesn''t really matter.\n\nRather, I want to use this

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "Who was
      Richard Hamming, and why should you read his book?\n\nIf you''ve taken computer
      science courses or messed around enough with\n*scipy*, you might recognize his
      name in a few different\nplaces---[Hamming error-correction\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code),
      the [Hamming window\nfunction](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.hamming.html),\nthe
      [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance),\nthe [Hamming
      bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_bound), etc. I\nhad heard of some
      of these concepts, but didn''t know anything concrete\nabout him before I started
      reading this book.\n\nHis brief biography is as follows: Richard Hamming (1915--1998)
      studied\nmathematics at the University of Chicago, earned a PhD in three years\nfrom
      Illinois, and then started as a professor at the University of\nLouisville...
      in 1944. He was almost immediately recruited for the\nManhattan Project, where
      he worked on large-scale simulations of\nimploding spherical shells of explosives,
      and generally acted as a\n\"computational janitor\" for various projects.\n\nIn
      1946, he moved to Bell Telephone Laboratories, [\"arguably the most\ninnovative
      research institution in the\ncountry,\"](https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review)\nand
      worked there until 1976. During his time at Bell Labs, he was\ninvolved in \"nearly
      all of the laboratories\\'' most prominent\nachievements\"\n([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)),
      and was\nrewarded with such accolades as the third-ever Turing Award (essentially\nthe
      Nobel Prize for computer science) and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming\nmedal. (You
      know you''re successful when someone else names an award\nafter you!)\n\nAfter
      he retired from Bell Labs, Hamming went on to go teach classes at\nthe Naval
      Postgraduate School. This book---published in 1996, just\nbefore his death---is
      based on the capstone engineering class he taught\nthere, which attempted to
      prepare students for their technical future by\nconveying the \"style of thinking\"
      necessary to be a great scientist and\nengineer. Stripe Press calls it \"a provocative
      challenge to anyone who\nwants to build something great\" and \"a manual of
      style for how to get\nthere,\" while the foreword calls it a \"tour of scientific
      greatness\"\nwhich prepares \"the next generation for even greater greatness\"
      while\nchallenging them to serve the public good.\n\nI was excited to read this
      book because:\n\n1.  Hamming was present at arguably the two most successful
      scientific\n    institutions of the 20th century---the Manhattan Project and
      Bell\n    Labs---and so was witness to more innovative scientific discoveries\n    than
      almost anyone today. So if anyone has a shot at teaching how to\n    be an effective
      scientist, it''s Hamming.\n\n2.  The interface between academic science and
      real-world advances seems\n    to be one of the most broken elements of the
      modern research\n    ecosystem, and I was interested to see what Hamming, as
      a\n    self-proclaimed scientist and engineer, had to say on the subject.\n\n3.  It''s
      a first-hand account of the creation of the most important\n    field of the
      past century---computer science---and thus a way to\n    witness, albeit second-hand,
      the important process of [scientific\n    branch-creation](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/when-do-ideas-get-easier-to-find).\n\n4.  The
      book is a chance to see computing, and computer science, as it\n    was before
      the implications and importance of the field became\n    obvious, and thus a
      way to understand what a promising area of\n    research looks like without
      the benefit of hindsight.\n\n5.  This is a chance to read frank and honest reflections
      from someone\n    who both was a great scientist and was adjacent to a huge
      number of\n    other great scientists, and thus learn about the culture of\n    successful
      science (especially successful science in the mid-20th\n    century, which might
      be different than the science of today).\n\n## **1. What''s In The Book?** {#whats-in-the-book}\n\n*The
      Art of Doing Science and Engineering* is not a conventional\ntextbook, but neither
      is it a self-help book, a memoir, or a guide to\npersonal strategy. The two
      books that remind me of it most are *Godel,\nEscher, Bach*, by Douglas Hofstadter,
      and *Zero To One*, by Peter Thiel.\nAll three books are composed of various
      pseudo-independent chapters\nwhich, in isolation, could likely function as essays,
      but which echo\ncertain themes over and over again in a way that makes the whole
      greater\nthan the sum of its parts in a hard-to-summarize way.\n\nHamming''s
      goal in structuring the book this way is clear, and explicitly\nstated: he doesn''t
      want to teach object-level facts, because the facts\nneeded to succeed in any
      discipline will inevitably change over the\ncourse of time. Instead he seeks
      to teach the patterns of thought which\nwill enable anyone to succeed in an
      evolving technical landscape. To do\nso, he uses a mix of first-person stories,
      historical reflections,\nmathematical proofs, and graphs, all with the goal
      of teaching something\nthat''s essentially incommunicable: style. I quote:\n\n>
      I will show you my style as best I can, but, again, you must take\n> those elements
      of it which seem to fit you, and you must finally\n> create your own style.
      Either you will be a leader or a follower, and\n> my goal for you is to be a
      leader. You cannot adopt every trait I\n> discuss in what I have observed in
      myself and others; you must select\n> and adapt, and make them your own if the
      course is to be effective.\n\nDespite Hamming''s insistence that there is \"really
      no technical content\"\nin the book and that any mathematics is only \"window
      dressing,\" I found\nthat my lack of background knowledge made several\nchapters---particularly
      those on digital filters---quite difficult to\nunderstand.\n\n## **2. Representative
      Anecdotes** {#representative-anecdotes}\n\nIn keeping with Hamming''s desire
      to convey the \"style of thinking\"\nrather than actual object-level scientific
      ideas, I''ll share a few\nanecdotes, insights, and quotes in an attempt to reproduce
      the style of\nhis writing.\n\n### **2.1 The Second Mouse Gets The Cheese** {#the-second-mouse-gets-the-cheese}\n\nHamming
      recounts the invention of interpreters and compilers and then\nreflects on how
      hard it was for early computer pioneers to think of\ncomputers as \"symbol manipulators
      and not just number crunchers,\"\nobserving that often the first people in a
      field do not understand it as\nwell as those who come after them. Why is this?\n\n>
      The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight through so\n> many
      dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding and\n> confusion,
      they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is\n> open and the path
      made easy.... in time the same will probably be true\n> of you.\n\nThis is a
      nice observation, and perhaps explains the value of startups:\nincumbents in
      a market can be inefficient not only for bureaucratic\nreasons, but also because
      they''re intellectually less suited to see new\nopportunities---the young can
      see the status quo more clearly than those\nwho''ve had to create it. This also
      explains why \"really new ideas seldom\narise from the experts in the field\"---experts
      always bring their\nexpertise when looking at something new, which makes them
      more likely to\nbe correct, but also disincentivizes new ways of thinking and
      thus\ncreates a sort of status quo bias.\n\n### **2.2 Order-of-Magnitude Changes**
      {#order-of-magnitude-changes}\n\nMany people, faced with early computers, dismissed
      them as simply a\nfaster way to do rote calculations---which seems silly in
      hindsight, but\nwas a real barrier for early computer pioneers to overcome.
      Hamming\nargues \"a single order of magnitude change (a factor of ten) produces\nfundamentally
      new effects\" in any piece of technology, and immediately\nthereafter reflects
      on how it''s difficult for people to accept something\nnew:\n\n> People always
      want to think that something new is just like the\n> past---they like to be
      comfortable in their minds as well as their\n> bodies---and hence they prevent
      themselves from making any significant\n> contribution to the new field being
      created under their noses. Not\n> everything which is said to be new really
      is new, and it is hard to\n> decide in some cases when something is new, yet
      the all too common\n> reaction of \"it''s nothing new\" is stupid.\n\nI had
      previously attributed the idea that ten-fold improvement creates a\nfundamentally
      new product to Peter Thiel (*Zero To One*, pp. 48--49),\nbut it seems Hamming
      (as usual) got there first.\n\n### **2.3 Intuition In High Dimensions** {#intuition-in-high-dimensions}\n\nSince
      most complex problems occur in high-dimensional spaces, Hamming\nillustrates
      a few ways that our 2D or 3D intuition can fail us.\n\nOne particularly nice
      thought experiment is this: take a square with\nside length 4 and divide it
      into four squares, each containing a unit\ncircle. Now draw a circle in the
      middle of the square, such that the\ncircle just touches each of the four unit
      circles. Realizing that the\ndistance from the center of this circle to the
      center of each unit\ncircle must be \u221a2, and that the radius of the unit
      circle is, of course,\n1, we can see that the radius of the inner circle must
      be \u221a2 - 1 \u2248\n0.414.\n\nNow, we can perform the same mental exercise
      for a cube with side length\nfour, and find that the analogous inner sphere
      has side length \u221a3 - 1 \u2248\n0.732. More generally, as we extend this
      exercise to higher dimensions,\nwe find that the radius of the inner *n*-dimensional
      hypersphere is\n\u221a*n* - 1, which is bizarre! For instance, in ten dimensions,
      the inner\nsphere has radius \u221a10 - 1 \u2248 2.162, meaning that it reaches
      outside of\nthe surrounding cube:\n\n> Yes, the sphere is convex, yes it touches
      each of the 1,024 packed\n> spheres on the inside, yet it reaches outside the
      cube! So much for\n> your raw intuition about n-dimensional space, but remember
      the\n> n-dimensional space is where the design of complex objects generally\n>
      takes place.\n\nThis sort of intuition is difficult to obtain, but Hamming gives
      a few\nexamples. One that stuck with me was the claim that, in high-dimensional\nshapes,
      almost all of the volume is on the surface---so \"almost surely\nthe optimal
      design will be on the surface and will not be inside, as you\nmight think from
      taking the calculus and doing optimizations in that\ncourse.\"\n\n### **2.4
      The Fast Fourier Transform** {#the-fast-fourier-transform}\n\nHere''s a memorable
      story from Hamming''s life:\n\n> You have all heard about the fast Fourier transform
      \\[FFT\\] and the\n> Tukey-Cooley paper. It is sometimes called the *Tukey-Cooley*\n>
      transform or algorithm. Tukey had suggested to me, sort of, the basic\n> ideas
      of the FFT. I had at the time an IBM Card Programmed Calculator\n> (CPC) and
      the \"butterfly\" operation meant it was completely\n> impractical to do with
      the equipment I had. Some years later I had an\n> internally programmed IBM
      650 and he remarked on it again. All I\n> remembered was that it was one of
      Tukey''s few bad ideas; I completely\n> forgot why it was bad---namely because
      of the equipment I had at the\n> time. So I did not do the FFT, though a book
      I had already published\n> (1961) shows I knew all the facts necessary, and
      could have done it\n> easily!  \n>   \n> Moral: when you know something cannot
      be done, also remember the\n> essential reason why, so later, when the circumstances
      have changed,\n> you will not say \"It can''t be done.\" Think of my error!
      How much more\n> stupid can anyone be?\n\nLater in the book, Hamming puts forward
      the following \"old statement\"\nabout experts:\n\n> If an expert says something
      can be done he is probably correct, but if\n> he says it is impossible then
      consider getting another opinion.\n\n### **2.5 The Mixed Blessings of Jargon**
      {#the-mixed-blessings-of-jargon}\n\nHamming emphasizes the importance, as an
      interdisciplinary scientist, of\nmastering the language of the field in which
      you''re working, but warns\nagainst embracing jargon too much. Why? Jargon serves
      \"to facilitate\ncommunication over a restricted area of things or events...
      \\[but\\] also\nblocks thinking outside the original area it was designed to
      cover.\" So\njargon makes intra-domain communication easier, but makes inter-domain\ncommunication
      harder.\n\nMore philosophically, jargon is a consequence of how \"we have been\nmainly
      selected by evolution to resent outsiders,\" and thus the\n\"instinctive use
      of jargon\" is a base instinct that must be consciously\nresisted.\n\n### **2.6
      Optimal Components, Suboptimal Systems** {#optimal-components-suboptimal-systems}\n\nHamming
      discusses the field of systems engineering, which he defines as\n\"the attempt
      to keep at all times the larger goals in mind and to\ntranslate local actions
      into global results\" (emphasis original), and\ncoins the first rule of systems
      engineering:\n\n> If you optimize the components, you will probably ruin the
      system\n> performance.\n\nThis point is illustrated with a few examples. One
      of these examples is\nthe progressive optimization of calculus and linear algebra
      classes in\ncollege, where \"we have stripped out anything not immediately relevant\nto
      each course,\" leading to \"large parts of any mathematical education\nbeing
      omitted in the urge to optimize the individual courses.\" Only when\nthe proper
      goal of a mathematical education is taken into\naccount---producing well-trained
      students with a firm grasp of math and\nthe ability to apply it to important
      problems---can the constituent\ncourses sanely be optimized.\n\nI found this
      idea pretty insightful, and have thought about it a lot\nsince reading this
      book. For instance, one can see many researchers as\nover-optimizing for \"publishing
      papers\" or \"winning grants\" rather than\nworking towards maximizing total
      scientific progress. (Alex Danco has a\ngreat piece discussing the same ideas
      in the context of the Canadian\ntech ecosystem, which I wrote about\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221206_definite_games_indefinite_optimism.html).)\n\n###
      **2.7 Learning Should Be Difficult** {#learning-should-be-difficult}\n\nI like
      this story so much I''ll just reproduce it in its entirety:\n\n> When I first
      came to the Naval Postgraduate School in 1976 there was a\n> nice dean of the
      extension division concerned with education. In some\n> hot discussions on education
      we differed. One day I came into his\n> office and said I was teaching a weightlifting
      class (which he knew I\n> was not). I went on to say that graduation was lifting
      250 pounds, and\n> I had found many students got discouraged and dropped out,
      some\n> repeated the course, and a very few graduated. I went on to say\n> thinking
      this over last night I decided the problem could be easily\n> cured by simply
      cutting the weights in half---the student in order to\n> graduate, would lift
      125 pounds, set them down, and then lift the\n> other 125 pounds, thus lifting
      the 250 pounds.  \n>   \n> I waited a moment while he smiled (as you probably
      have) and I then\n> observed that when I found a simpler proof for a theorem
      in\n> mathematics and used it in class, was I or was I not cutting the\n> weights
      in half? What is your answer? Is there not an element of truth\n> in the observation
      that the easier we make the learning for the\n> student, the more we are cutting
      the weights in half?\n\nThis story reflects a key belief of Hamming''s: that
      creativity and\ntalent in technical disciplines are not innate traits given
      only to rare\ngeniuses, but trainable skills which anyone can hope to acquire
      and\nimprove at, given the appropriate training regimen. In Hamming''s\nworldview,
      staring at a confusing math problem is not a sign that you''re\na failure, but
      the process by which you become successful.\n\n### **2.8 The Importance of Presentation**
      {#the-importance-of-presentation}\n\nHamming emphasizes that being able to \"sell\"
      one''s ideas is a key part\nof being a scientist:\n\n> All \\[methods of conveying
      ideas\\] are essential---you must learn to\n> sell your ideas, not by propaganda,
      but by force of clear\n> presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out;
      many scientists\n> and others think good ideas will win out automatically and
      need not be\n> carefully presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had
      to be\n> rediscovered because it was not well presented the first time, years\n>
      before! New ideas are automatically resisted by the establishment, and\n> to
      some extent justly. The organization cannot be in a continual state\n> of ferment
      and change, but it should respond to significant changes.\n\nIn this view, a
      certain degree of institutional conservatism is\nnecessary to avoid being swept
      up by any new fad (in machine learning\nterms, we might say that organizations
      need to limit their learning\nrate), and so you alone must convince your peers
      that your insights are\nthe real deal and deserve to be taken seriously.\n\nHamming
      then extends this idea to needing to sell your abilities more\nbroadly:\n\n>
      You do not hire a plumber to learn plumbing while trying to fix your\n> trouble;
      you expect he is already an expert. Similarly, only when you\n> have developed
      your abilities will you generally get the freedom to\n> practice your expertise,
      whatever you choose to make it, including the\n> expertise of \"universality,\"
      as I did.\n\nMy experience within science is that most people are a bit allergic
      to\nthe idea of \"selling\" themselves or their research---with the exception\nof
      a few people who become almost addicted to it. Hamming (who never\nshies away
      from quoting a Greek philosopher) would probably think that\nthere''s an Aristotelian
      mean between these two extremes: the ideal\nscientist/engineer recognizes that
      self-promotion is a necessary means\nto an end, but never engages in self-promotion
      absent a higher goal.\n\n## **3. Overall Themes** {#overall-themes}\n\nI would
      summarize Hamming''s key themes---those leitmotifs which pop up\ntime and time
      again in the book---as the following:\n\n### **3.1 Fundamentals Are Key** {#fundamentals-are-key}\n\nWherever
      possible, try to understand the intellectual underpinnings of a\nfield as well
      as possible, rather than the surface-level results. If you\ndo so, you will
      not only understand the field better than most of its\npractitioners, but also
      be better at transferring knowledge between\nfields. Perceiving \"the essential
      unity of all knowledge rather than the\nfragments which appear as the individual
      topics are taught\" allows one\nto quickly access relevant information to the
      problem at hand, no matter\nthe field of origin.\n\nHamming frequently points
      out the failings of domain experts to perceive\nthe fundamental underpinnings
      of their knowledge:\n\n> Lo and behold, the famous *transfer function* is exactly
      the\n> *eigenvalues* of the corresponding eigenfunctions! Upon asking various\n>
      electrical engineers what the transfer function was, no one has ever\n> told
      me that! Yes, when pointed out to them that it is the same idea\n> they have
      to agree, but the fact it is the same idea never seemed to\n> have crossed their
      minds! The same, simple idea, in two or more\n> different disguises in their
      minds, and they knew of no connection\n> between them! Get down to the basics
      every time! *(emphasis original)*\n\nNot only is a good grasp of fundamentals
      important for understanding\nyour own domain, it also helps with creativity.
      Hamming argues that\ncreative insights come from the subconscious, and that
      \"flexible access\nto pieces of knowledge\" is the most important way to give
      the\nsubconscious the tools it needs to solve a problem. This flexible access\narises
      from \"looking at knowledge while you are acquiring it from many\ndifferent
      angles,\" making sure to capture its key features rather than\nsimply memorizing
      the aspect relevant to the task at hand.\n\n(The idea that creativity comes
      from the subconscious is pretty\ncommon---see, for instance, Nisbett and Wallace''s
      article [\"Telling More\nThan We Can\nKnow,\"](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/nisbett%20saying%20more.pdf)\nwhich
      argues that basically all higher order cognitive processes are\nsubconscious.)\n\n###
      **3.2 Gain Insight Where Possible** {#gain-insight-where-possible}\n\nNo matter
      the task at hand, Hamming argues that the correct immediate\nstep is always
      to gain insight about the situation, and then go from\nthere. He uses the example
      of Planck and the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\"\nto illustrate how crucial insight
      can be:\n\n> Max Planck (1858--1947) fit the black-body radiation experimental
      data\n> with an empirical curve, and it fit so well he \"knew\" it was \"the\n>
      right formula.\" He set out to derive it, but had trouble. Finally he\n> used
      a standard method of breaking up the energy into finite sizes and\n> then going
      to the limit... Fortunately for Planck the formula fit only\n> so long as he
      avoided the limit, and no matter how he took the limit\n> the formula disappeared.
      He finally, being a very good, honest\n> physicist, decided he had to stop short
      of the limit, and that is what\n> defines Planck''s constant!  \n>   \n> *\\[another
      historical paragraph omitted\\]*  \n>   \n> Before going on, let me discuss
      how this piece of history has affected\n> my behavior in science. Clearly Planck
      was led to create the theory\n> because the approximating curve fit so well,
      and had the proper form.\n> I reasoned, therefore, if I were to help anyone
      do a similar thing, I\n> had better represent things in terms of functions they
      believed would\n> be proper for their field rather than in the standard polynomials.
      I\n> therefore abandoned the standard polynomial approach to approximation,\n>
      which numerical analysts and statisticians among others use most of\n> the time,
      for the harder approach of finding which class of functions\n> I should use.\n\nThis
      episode demonstrates how insight can arise from a simulation, and\nenable future
      work (like, in this case, all of quantum mechanics), and\nalso illustrates how
      the manner in which one performs simulations can\nmake it either easier or harder
      to obtain underlying insights about the\nproblem. Hamming emphasizes this point
      with a few stories from his time\nat Bell Labs, and argues that there are times
      where more computational\npower is actually counterproductive:\n\n> I have often
      wondered what would have happened \\[in the Nike guided\n> missile project\\]
      if I had had a modern, high-speed computer. Would I\n> ever have acquired the
      feeling for the missile, upon which so much\n> depended in the final design?

      be disguised in any full-scale simulation. *(emphasis original)*\n\nThis point---that
      simulation is not the same as understanding---is not\nunique to Hamming (see
      *inter alia* Roald Hoffmann on the subject:\n[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201902527),\n[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910283),\n[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910285)),\nbut
      hearing this from the father of scientific simulation certainly\ndrives the
      message home!\n\n### **3.3 Vision Matters** {#vision-matters}\n\nHamming goes
      to great lengths to emphasize the importance of having a\nvision for your life:\n\n>
      It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right\n> with
      n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about\n> \u221a*n* steps
      from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one\n> direction, then his
      steps will tend to go in that direction and he\n> will go a distance proportional
      to *n*. In a lifetime of many, many\n> independent choices, small and large,
      a career with vision will get\n> you a distance proportional to *n*, while no
      vision will get you only\n> the distance \u221a*n*. In a sense, the main difference
      between those who\n> go far and those who do not is some people have a vision
      and the\n> others do not and therefore can only react to the current events
      as\n> they happen... having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders\n>
      from the followers.\n\nThis theme permeates his discussion of systems engineering:
      a successful\nsystems engineer must, at all times, keep the overall vision and
      purpose\nof the system in mind, so as to optimize in the right direction. It
      also\nmotivates what problems you must choose:\n\n> If you do not work on important
      problems, how can you expect to do\n> important work? Yet direct observation
      and direct questioning of\n> people show most scientists spend most of their
      time working on things\n> they believe are not important and are not likely
      to lead to important\n> things.\n\nIn Hamming''s view, it seems the precise
      vision one follows is less\nimportant than the simple act of having a vision
      at all. Forcing oneself\nto decide on goals and then strive to fulfill them
      will naturally lead\nyou to excellence, even if the goals you choose aren''t
      the same as the\none Hamming would have chosen:\n\n> The chief gain is in the
      effort to change yourself, in the struggle\n> with yourself, and it is less
      in the winning than you might expect.\n> Yes, it is nice to end up where you
      wanted to be, but the person you\n> are when you get there is far more important.
      I believe a life in\n> which you do not try to extend yourself regularly is
      not worth\n> living---but it is up to you to pick the goals you believe are
      worth\n> striving for.\n\n## **4. Should You Read This Book?** {#should-you-read-this-book}\n\nI
      began this book review by claiming that *The Art of Doing Science and\nEngineering*
      isn''t a textbook, or a self-help book, or a memoir, but\nfailed to offer a
      positive vision of what it was. I now reveal my true\nopinion: *The Art of Doing
      Science and Engineering* is best viewed as a\nmodern example of [\"wisdom\nliterature,\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature)
      in the\nstyle of ancient scriptures.\n\nWhy is this? Wisdom literature frequently
      has the curious property that\nit''s accessible only to the wise. For instance,
      the book of Proverbs is\nostensibly written to convey wisdom to those who seek
      it, but this\nhardly seems compatible with the following passage (Proverbs 26:7--9):\n\n>
      Like a lame man\\''s legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth\n>
      of fools.  \n> Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor
      to a\n> fool.  \n> Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is
      a proverb in\n> the mouth of fools.\n\nIf proverbs are useless---or worse than
      useless, a thorn in the hand of\na drunkard---to those without wisdom, then
      what is the point of\nproverbs? If only the wise can understand your book of
      wisdom, why\nbother writing it at all?\n\nThere are several ways to resolve
      this tension (one being \"the book of\nProverbs is stupid\"), but I think the
      right answer goes something like\nthis: wisdom is accessible to those who seek
      it, but simply reading\nthrough a book of wisdom isn''t sufficient to make one
      wise. Rather, the\nsearch for wisdom requires discipline and vigilance---one
      must meditate\non wise sayings, appreciate the underlying principles, and learn
      to\ndiscern what''s right even in complicated circumstances. So, wisdom\nliterature
      can help us on the journey to wisdom, but ultimately we will\nhave to take the
      intellectual burden upon ourselves if we hope to get\nanywhere. (This is roughly
      how [John Piper interprets\nProverbs](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-discoveries-begin-as-problems).)\n\nViewing
      Hamming''s book as essentially modern wisdom literature makes\nsense of his
      focus on the \"style\" of thinking, his insistence that the\nreader must rediscover
      much of what he''s saying for themselves, and his\nadmonitions not to accept
      what he''s saying blindly but to think it over\nat length:\n\n> You the reader
      should take your own opinions and try first to express\n> them clearly, and
      then examine them with counterarguments, back and\n> forth, until *you are fairly
      clear as to what you believe and why you\n> believe it*. It is none of the author''s
      business in this matter what\n> you believe, but it is the author''s business
      to get you to think and\n> articulate your position clearly. *(emphasis original)*\n\nIf
      we view this book---Hamming''s guide to future scientists and\nengineers, his
      *magnum opus* as a teacher and mentor---as wisdom\nliterature, it implies that
      wisdom, not any specific technical skill, is\nrate-limiting for technical progress.
      This is very encouraging, because\nwisdom, unlike innate intelligence, is an
      acquired trait, and one which\nwe can all cultivate in ourselves. We can''t
      all be Ramanujan or von\nNeumann, but (at least as Hamming tells it) we can
      all be Hamming.\n\nThus far, I''ve mostly given reasons why you should read
      this book. Why\nshouldn''t you read this book? One reason is that this book
      is aimed at\nscientists and engineers, and furthermore it seems primarily aimed
      at\npeople with an interest in the \"hard\" sciences---much of the advice\nassumes
      some contact with simulation, math, or physics. So a reader\nwithout at least
      a glancing interest in these topics might struggle to\nfind some of the content
      relevant. (But maybe the act of extending his\nadvice to other domains would
      prompt deeper consideration of the\nfundamental principles at play, and thus
      serve to cultivate wisdom!)\n\nAnother reason you shouldn''t read this book
      is that it''s very much\nframed as a personal guide---it addresses the needs
      of an individual\nscientist, not ideas for how science writ large could be improved.
      So\naspiring metascientists might be disappointed by Hamming''s perspective;\nhe
      dedicates a lot of time to thinking about how one can navigate\nimperfect organizations,
      and much less time to thinking about what a\nperfect organization would look
      like.\n\nThe strongest reason for reading this book, though, is that the world\nHamming
      hopes to write for is almost exactly our world today. Hamming\nanticipates \"the
      inevitable and extensive computerization of your\norganization and society generally,\"
      a world in which scientists are\nfrequently overwhelmed by the \"rate of innovation
      and change of the\ndominant paradigm,\" and a world where there is \"not time
      to allow us the\nleisure which comes from separating the two fields\" of science
      and\nengineering. From my perspective, this almost perfectly captures the\nfeeling
      of working in science or tech today.\n\nAnd so Hamming''s message---the vision
      of scientists \"trying to achieve\nexcellence\" through making \"significant
      contributions to humanity\" on\nimportant problems---seems more relevant today
      than ever. If you\nyourself work in a scientific field, and want to know how
      to have the\ngreatest positive impact on your own character and on society,
      then\nHamming''s wisdom is for you: but not without some struggle\n\n*A transcript
      of Hamming''s talk \"You and Your Research\" (a shorter\nexposition of some
      of the ideas discussed above) is available\n[here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html),\nand*

      was Richard Hamming, and why should you read his book?\\n\\nIf you've taken
      computer science courses or messed around enough with\\n*scipy*, you might recognize
      his name in a few different\\nplaces---[Hamming error-correction\\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code),
      the [Hamming window\\nfunction](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.hamming.html),\\nthe
      [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance),\\nthe [Hamming
      bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_bound), etc. I\\nhad heard of some
      of these concepts, but didn't know anything concrete\\nabout him before I started
      reading this book.\\n\\nHis brief biography is as follows: Richard Hamming (1915--1998)
      studied\\nmathematics at the University of Chicago, earned a PhD in three years\\nfrom
      Illinois, and then started as a professor at the University of\\nLouisville...
      in 1944. He was almost immediately recruited for the\\nManhattan Project, where
      he worked on large-scale simulations of\\nimploding spherical shells of explosives,
      and generally acted as a\\n\\\"computational janitor\\\" for various projects.\\n\\nIn
      1946, he moved to Bell Telephone Laboratories, [\\\"arguably the most\\ninnovative
      research institution in the\\ncountry,\\\"](https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review)\\nand
      worked there until 1976. During his time at Bell Labs, he was\\ninvolved in
      \\\"nearly all of the laboratories\\\\' most prominent\\nachievements\\\"\\n([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)),
      and was\\nrewarded with such accolades as the third-ever Turing Award (essentially\\nthe
      Nobel Prize for computer science) and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming\\nmedal. (You
      know you're successful when someone else names an award\\nafter you!)\\n\\nAfter
      he retired from Bell Labs, Hamming went on to go teach classes at\\nthe Naval
      Postgraduate School. This book---published in 1996, just\\nbefore his death---is
      based on the capstone engineering class he taught\\nthere, which attempted to
      prepare students for their technical future by\\nconveying the \\\"style of
      thinking\\\" necessary to be a great scientist and\\nengineer. Stripe Press
      calls it \\\"a provocative challenge to anyone who\\nwants to build something
      great\\\" and \\\"a manual of style for how to get\\nthere,\\\" while the foreword
      calls it a \\\"tour of scientific greatness\\\"\\nwhich prepares \\\"the next
      generation for even greater greatness\\\" while\\nchallenging them to serve
      the public good.\\n\\nI was excited to read this book because:\\n\\n1.  Hamming
      was present at arguably the two most successful scientific\\n    institutions
      of the 20th century---the Manhattan Project and Bell\\n    Labs---and so was
      witness to more innovative scientific discoveries\\n    than almost anyone today.
      So if anyone has a shot at teaching how to\\n    be an effective scientist,
      it's Hamming.\\n\\n2.  The interface between academic science and real-world
      advances seems\\n    to be one of the most broken elements of the modern research\\n
      \   ecosystem, and I was interested to see what Hamming, as a\\n    self-proclaimed
      scientist and engineer, had to say on the subject.\\n\\n3.  It's a first-hand
      account of the creation of the most important\\n    field of the past century---computer
      science---and thus a way to\\n    witness, albeit second-hand, the important
      process of [scientific\\n    branch-creation](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/when-do-ideas-get-easier-to-find).\\n\\n4.
      \ The book is a chance to see computing, and computer science, as it\\n    was
      before the implications and importance of the field became\\n    obvious, and
      thus a way to understand what a promising area of\\n    research looks like
      without the benefit of hindsight.\\n\\n5.  This is a chance to read frank and
      honest reflections from someone\\n    who both was a great scientist and was
      adjacent to a huge number of\\n    other great scientists, and thus learn about
      the culture of\\n    successful science (especially successful science in the
      mid-20th\\n    century, which might be different than the science of today).\\n\\n##
      **1. What's In The Book?** {#whats-in-the-book}\\n\\n*The Art of Doing Science
      and Engineering* is not a conventional\\ntextbook, but neither is it a self-help
      book, a memoir, or a guide to\\npersonal strategy. The two books that remind
      me of it most are *Godel,\\nEscher, Bach*, by Douglas Hofstadter, and *Zero
      To One*, by Peter Thiel.\\nAll three books are composed of various pseudo-independent
      chapters\\nwhich, in isolation, could likely function as essays, but which echo\\ncertain
      themes over and over again in a way that makes the whole greater\\nthan the
      sum of its parts in a hard-to-summarize way.\\n\\nHamming's goal in structuring
      the book this way is clear, and explicitly\\nstated: he doesn't want to teach
      object-level facts, because the facts\\nneeded to succeed in any discipline
      will inevitably change over the\\ncourse of time. Instead he seeks to teach
      the patterns of thought which\\nwill enable anyone to succeed in an evolving
      technical landscape. To do\\nso, he uses a mix of first-person stories, historical
      reflections,\\nmathematical proofs, and graphs, all with the goal of teaching
      something\\nthat's essentially incommunicable: style. I quote:\\n\\n> I will
      show you my style as best I can, but, again, you must take\\n> those elements
      of it which seem to fit you, and you must finally\\n> create your own style.
      Either you will be a leader or a follower, and\\n> my goal for you is to be
      a leader. You cannot adopt every trait I\\n> discuss in what I have observed
      in myself and others; you must select\\n> and adapt, and make them your own
      if the course is to be effective.\\n\\nDespite Hamming's insistence that there
      is \\\"really no technical content\\\"\\nin the book and that any mathematics
      is only \\\"window dressing,\\\" I found\\nthat my lack of background knowledge
      made several\\nchapters---particularly those on digital filters---quite difficult
      to\\nunderstand.\\n\\n## **2. Representative Anecdotes** {#representative-anecdotes}\\n\\nIn
      keeping with Hamming's desire to convey the \\\"style of thinking\\\"\\nrather
      than actual object-level scientific ideas, I'll share a few\\nanecdotes, insights,
      and quotes in an attempt to reproduce the style of\\nhis writing.\\n\\n### **2.1
      The Second Mouse Gets The Cheese** {#the-second-mouse-gets-the-cheese}\\n\\nHamming
      recounts the invention of interpreters and compilers and then\\nreflects on
      how hard it was for early computer pioneers to think of\\ncomputers as \\\"symbol
      manipulators and not just number crunchers,\\\"\\nobserving that often the first
      people in a field do not understand it as\\nwell as those who come after them.
      Why is this?\\n\\n> The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight
      through so\\n> many dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding
      and\\n> confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is\\n>
      open and the path made easy.... in time the same will probably be true\\n> of
      you.\\n\\nThis is a nice observation, and perhaps explains the value of startups:\\nincumbents
      in a market can be inefficient not only for bureaucratic\\nreasons, but also
      because they're intellectually less suited to see new\\nopportunities---the
      young can see the status quo more clearly than those\\nwho've had to create
      it. This also explains why \\\"really new ideas seldom\\narise from the experts
      in the field\\\"---experts always bring their\\nexpertise when looking at something
      new, which makes them more likely to\\nbe correct, but also disincentivizes
      new ways of thinking and thus\\ncreates a sort of status quo bias.\\n\\n###
      **2.2 Order-of-Magnitude Changes** {#order-of-magnitude-changes}\\n\\nMany people,
      faced with early computers, dismissed them as simply a\\nfaster way to do rote
      calculations---which seems silly in hindsight, but\\nwas a real barrier for
      early computer pioneers to overcome. Hamming\\nargues \\\"a single order of
      magnitude change (a factor of ten) produces\\nfundamentally new effects\\\"
      in any piece of technology, and immediately\\nthereafter reflects on how it's
      difficult for people to accept something\\nnew:\\n\\n> People always want to
      think that something new is just like the\\n> past---they like to be comfortable
      in their minds as well as their\\n> bodies---and hence they prevent themselves
      from making any significant\\n> contribution to the new field being created
      under their noses. Not\\n> everything which is said to be new really is new,
      and it is hard to\\n> decide in some cases when something is new, yet the all
      too common\\n> reaction of \\\"it's nothing new\\\" is stupid.\\n\\nI had previously
      attributed the idea that ten-fold improvement creates a\\nfundamentally new
      product to Peter Thiel (*Zero To One*, pp. 48--49),\\nbut it seems Hamming (as
      usual) got there first.\\n\\n### **2.3 Intuition In High Dimensions** {#intuition-in-high-dimensions}\\n\\nSince
      most complex problems occur in high-dimensional spaces, Hamming\\nillustrates
      a few ways that our 2D or 3D intuition can fail us.\\n\\nOne particularly nice
      thought experiment is this: take a square with\\nside length 4 and divide it
      into four squares, each containing a unit\\ncircle. Now draw a circle in the
      middle of the square, such that the\\ncircle just touches each of the four unit
      circles. Realizing that the\\ndistance from the center of this circle to the
      center of each unit\\ncircle must be \u221A2, and that the radius of the unit
      circle is, of course,\\n1, we can see that the radius of the inner circle must
      be \u221A2 - 1 \u2248\\n0.414.\\n\\nNow, we can perform the same mental exercise
      for a cube with side length\\nfour, and find that the analogous inner sphere
      has side length \u221A3 - 1 \u2248\\n0.732. More generally, as we extend this
      exercise to higher dimensions,\\nwe find that the radius of the inner *n*-dimensional
      hypersphere is\\n\u221A*n* - 1, which is bizarre! For instance, in ten dimensions,
      the inner\\nsphere has radius \u221A10 - 1 \u2248 2.162, meaning that it reaches
      outside of\\nthe surrounding cube:\\n\\n> Yes, the sphere is convex, yes it
      touches each of the 1,024 packed\\n> spheres on the inside, yet it reaches outside
      the cube! So much for\\n> your raw intuition about n-dimensional space, but
      remember the\\n> n-dimensional space is where the design of complex objects
      generally\\n> takes place.\\n\\nThis sort of intuition is difficult to obtain,
      but Hamming gives a few\\nexamples. One that stuck with me was the claim that,
      in high-dimensional\\nshapes, almost all of the volume is on the surface---so
      \\\"almost surely\\nthe optimal design will be on the surface and will not be
      inside, as you\\nmight think from taking the calculus and doing optimizations
      in that\\ncourse.\\\"\\n\\n### **2.4 The Fast Fourier Transform** {#the-fast-fourier-transform}\\n\\nHere's
      a memorable story from Hamming's life:\\n\\n> You have all heard about the fast
      Fourier transform \\\\[FFT\\\\] and the\\n> Tukey-Cooley paper. It is sometimes
      called the *Tukey-Cooley*\\n> transform or algorithm. Tukey had suggested to
      me, sort of, the basic\\n> ideas of the FFT. I had at the time an IBM Card Programmed
      Calculator\\n> (CPC) and the \\\"butterfly\\\" operation meant it was completely\\n>
      impractical to do with the equipment I had. Some years later I had an\\n> internally
      programmed IBM 650 and he remarked on it again. All I\\n> remembered was that
      it was one of Tukey's few bad ideas; I completely\\n> forgot why it was bad---namely
      because of the equipment I had at the\\n> time. So I did not do the FFT, though
      a book I had already published\\n> (1961) shows I knew all the facts necessary,
      and could have done it\\n> easily!  \\n>   \\n> Moral: when you know something

      circumstances have changed,\\n> you will not say \\\"It can't be done.\\\" Think
      of my error! How much more\\n> stupid can anyone be?\\n\\nLater in the book,
      Hamming puts forward the following \\\"old statement\\\"\\nabout experts:\\n\\n>
      If an expert says something can be done he is probably correct, but if\\n> he
      says it is impossible then consider getting another opinion.\\n\\n### **2.5
      The Mixed Blessings of Jargon** {#the-mixed-blessings-of-jargon}\\n\\nHamming
      emphasizes the importance, as an interdisciplinary scientist, of\\nmastering
      the language of the field in which you're working, but warns\\nagainst embracing
      jargon too much. Why? Jargon serves \\\"to facilitate\\ncommunication over a
      restricted area of things or events... \\\\[but\\\\] also\\nblocks thinking
      outside the original area it was designed to cover.\\\" So\\njargon makes intra-domain
      communication easier, but makes inter-domain\\ncommunication harder.\\n\\nMore
      philosophically, jargon is a consequence of how \\\"we have been\\nmainly selected
      by evolution to resent outsiders,\\\" and thus the\\n\\\"instinctive use of
      jargon\\\" is a base instinct that must be consciously\\nresisted.\\n\\n###
      **2.6 Optimal Components, Suboptimal Systems** {#optimal-components-suboptimal-systems}\\n\\nHamming
      discusses the field of systems engineering, which he defines as\\n\\\"the attempt
      to keep at all times the larger goals in mind and to\\ntranslate local actions
      into global results\\\" (emphasis original), and\\ncoins the first rule of systems
      engineering:\\n\\n> If you optimize the components, you will probably ruin the
      system\\n> performance.\\n\\nThis point is illustrated with a few examples.
      One of these examples is\\nthe progressive optimization of calculus and linear
      algebra classes in\\ncollege, where \\\"we have stripped out anything not immediately
      relevant\\nto each course,\\\" leading to \\\"large parts of any mathematical
      education\\nbeing omitted in the urge to optimize the individual courses.\\\"
      Only when\\nthe proper goal of a mathematical education is taken into\\naccount---producing
      well-trained students with a firm grasp of math and\\nthe ability to apply it
      to important problems---can the constituent\\ncourses sanely be optimized.\\n\\nI
      found this idea pretty insightful, and have thought about it a lot\\nsince reading
      this book. For instance, one can see many researchers as\\nover-optimizing for
      \\\"publishing papers\\\" or \\\"winning grants\\\" rather than\\nworking towards
      maximizing total scientific progress. (Alex Danco has a\\ngreat piece discussing
      the same ideas in the context of the Canadian\\ntech ecosystem, which I wrote
      about\\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221206_definite_games_indefinite_optimism.html).)\\n\\n###
      **2.7 Learning Should Be Difficult** {#learning-should-be-difficult}\\n\\nI
      like this story so much I'll just reproduce it in its entirety:\\n\\n> When
      I first came to the Naval Postgraduate School in 1976 there was a\\n> nice dean
      of the extension division concerned with education. In some\\n> hot discussions
      on education we differed. One day I came into his\\n> office and said I was
      teaching a weightlifting class (which he knew I\\n> was not). I went on to say
      that graduation was lifting 250 pounds, and\\n> I had found many students got
      discouraged and dropped out, some\\n> repeated the course, and a very few graduated.
      I went on to say\\n> thinking this over last night I decided the problem could
      be easily\\n> cured by simply cutting the weights in half---the student in order
      to\\n> graduate, would lift 125 pounds, set them down, and then lift the\\n>
      other 125 pounds, thus lifting the 250 pounds.  \\n>   \\n> I waited a moment
      while he smiled (as you probably have) and I then\\n> observed that when I found
      a simpler proof for a theorem in\\n> mathematics and used it in class, was I
      or was I not cutting the\\n> weights in half? What is your answer? Is there
      not an element of truth\\n> in the observation that the easier we make the learning
      for the\\n> student, the more we are cutting the weights in half?\\n\\nThis
      story reflects a key belief of Hamming's: that creativity and\\ntalent in technical
      disciplines are not innate traits given only to rare\\ngeniuses, but trainable
      skills which anyone can hope to acquire and\\nimprove at, given the appropriate
      training regimen. In Hamming's\\nworldview, staring at a confusing math problem
      is not a sign that you're\\na failure, but the process by which you become successful.\\n\\n###
      **2.8 The Importance of Presentation** {#the-importance-of-presentation}\\n\\nHamming
      emphasizes that being able to \\\"sell\\\" one's ideas is a key part\\nof being
      a scientist:\\n\\n> All \\\\[methods of conveying ideas\\\\] are essential---you
      must learn to\\n> sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear\\n>
      presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists\\n> and
      others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be\\n> carefully
      presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be\\n> rediscovered because
      it was not well presented the first time, years\\n> before! New ideas are automatically
      resisted by the establishment, and\\n> to some extent justly. The organization
      cannot be in a continual state\\n> of ferment and change, but it should respond
      to significant changes.\\n\\nIn this view, a certain degree of institutional
      conservatism is\\nnecessary to avoid being swept up by any new fad (in machine
      learning\\nterms, we might say that organizations need to limit their learning\\nrate),
      and so you alone must convince your peers that your insights are\\nthe real
      deal and deserve to be taken seriously.\\n\\nHamming then extends this idea
      to needing to sell your abilities more\\nbroadly:\\n\\n> You do not hire a plumber
      to learn plumbing while trying to fix your\\n> trouble; you expect he is already
      an expert. Similarly, only when you\\n> have developed your abilities will you
      generally get the freedom to\\n> practice your expertise, whatever you choose
      to make it, including the\\n> expertise of \\\"universality,\\\" as I did.\\n\\nMy
      experience within science is that most people are a bit allergic to\\nthe idea
      of \\\"selling\\\" themselves or their research---with the exception\\nof a
      few people who become almost addicted to it. Hamming (who never\\nshies away
      from quoting a Greek philosopher) would probably think that\\nthere's an Aristotelian
      mean between these two extremes: the ideal\\nscientist/engineer recognizes that
      self-promotion is a necessary means\\nto an end, but never engages in self-promotion
      absent a higher goal.\\n\\n## **3. Overall Themes** {#overall-themes}\\n\\nI
      would summarize Hamming's key themes---those leitmotifs which pop up\\ntime
      and time again in the book---as the following:\\n\\n### **3.1 Fundamentals Are
      Key** {#fundamentals-are-key}\\n\\nWherever possible, try to understand the
      intellectual underpinnings of a\\nfield as well as possible, rather than the
      surface-level results. If you\\ndo so, you will not only understand the field
      better than most of its\\npractitioners, but also be better at transferring
      knowledge between\\nfields. Perceiving \\\"the essential unity of all knowledge
      rather than the\\nfragments which appear as the individual topics are taught\\\"
      allows one\\nto quickly access relevant information to the problem at hand,
      no matter\\nthe field of origin.\\n\\nHamming frequently points out the failings
      of domain experts to perceive\\nthe fundamental underpinnings of their knowledge:\\n\\n>
      Lo and behold, the famous *transfer function* is exactly the\\n> *eigenvalues*
      of the corresponding eigenfunctions! Upon asking various\\n> electrical engineers
      what the transfer function was, no one has ever\\n> told me that! Yes, when
      pointed out to them that it is the same idea\\n> they have to agree, but the
      fact it is the same idea never seemed to\\n> have crossed their minds! The same,
      simple idea, in two or more\\n> different disguises in their minds, and they
      knew of no connection\\n> between them! Get down to the basics every time! *(emphasis
      original)*\\n\\nNot only is a good grasp of fundamentals important for understanding\\nyour
      own domain, it also helps with creativity. Hamming argues that\\ncreative insights
      come from the subconscious, and that \\\"flexible access\\nto pieces of knowledge\\\"
      is the most important way to give the\\nsubconscious the tools it needs to solve
      a problem. This flexible access\\narises from \\\"looking at knowledge while
      you are acquiring it from many\\ndifferent angles,\\\" making sure to capture
      its key features rather than\\nsimply memorizing the aspect relevant to the
      task at hand.\\n\\n(The idea that creativity comes from the subconscious is
      pretty\\ncommon---see, for instance, Nisbett and Wallace's article [\\\"Telling
      More\\nThan We Can\\nKnow,\\\"](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/nisbett%20saying%20more.pdf)\\nwhich
      argues that basically all higher order cognitive processes are\\nsubconscious.)\\n\\n###
      **3.2 Gain Insight Where Possible** {#gain-insight-where-possible}\\n\\nNo matter
      the task at hand, Hamming argues that the correct immediate\\nstep is always
      to gain insight about the situation, and then go from\\nthere. He uses the example
      of Planck and the \\\"ultraviolet catastrophe\\\"\\nto illustrate how crucial
      insight can be:\\n\\n> Max Planck (1858--1947) fit the black-body radiation
      experimental data\\n> with an empirical curve, and it fit so well he \\\"knew\\\"
      it was \\\"the\\n> right formula.\\\" He set out to derive it, but had trouble.
      Finally he\\n> used a standard method of breaking up the energy into finite
      sizes and\\n> then going to the limit... Fortunately for Planck the formula
      fit only\\n> so long as he avoided the limit, and no matter how he took the
      limit\\n> the formula disappeared. He finally, being a very good, honest\\n>
      physicist, decided he had to stop short of the limit, and that is what\\n> defines
      Planck's constant!  \\n>   \\n> *\\\\[another historical paragraph omitted\\\\]*
      \ \\n>   \\n> Before going on, let me discuss how this piece of history has
      affected\\n> my behavior in science. Clearly Planck was led to create the theory\\n>
      because the approximating curve fit so well, and had the proper form.\\n> I
      reasoned, therefore, if I were to help anyone do a similar thing, I\\n> had
      better represent things in terms of functions they believed would\\n> be proper
      for their field rather than in the standard polynomials. I\\n> therefore abandoned
      the standard polynomial approach to approximation,\\n> which numerical analysts
      and statisticians among others use most of\\n> the time, for the harder approach
      of finding which class of functions\\n> I should use.\\n\\nThis episode demonstrates
      how insight can arise from a simulation, and\\nenable future work (like, in
      this case, all of quantum mechanics), and\\nalso illustrates how the manner
      in which one performs simulations can\\nmake it either easier or harder to obtain
      underlying insights about the\\nproblem. Hamming emphasizes this point with
      a few stories from his time\\nat Bell Labs, and argues that there are times
      where more computational\\npower is actually counterproductive:\\n\\n> I have
      often wondered what would have happened \\\\[in the Nike guided\\n> missile
      project\\\\] if I had had a modern, high-speed computer. Would I\\n> ever have
      acquired the feeling for the missile, upon which so much\\n> depended in the
      final design? I often doubt hundreds more trajectories\\n> would have taught
      me as much---I simply do not know. But that is why\\n> *I am suspicious, to
      this day, of getting too many solutions and not\\n> doing enough very careful
      thinking about what you have seen.* Volume\\n> output seems to me to be a poor
      substitute for acquiring an intimate\\n> feeling for the situation being simulated...
      doing simple simulations\\n> at the early stages lets you get insights into
      the whole system which\\n> would be disguised in any full-scale simulation.
      *(emphasis original)*\\n\\nThis point---that simulation is not the same as understanding---is
      not\\nunique to Hamming (see *inter alia* Roald Hoffmann on the subject:\\n[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201902527),\\n[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910283),\\n[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910285)),\\nbut
      hearing this from the father of scientific simulation certainly\\ndrives the
      message home!\\n\\n### **3.3 Vision Matters** {#vision-matters}\\n\\nHamming
      goes to great lengths to emphasize the importance of having a\\nvision for your
      life:\\n\\n> It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or
      right\\n> with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about\\n>
      \u221A*n* steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one\\n> direction,
      then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he\\n> will go a distance
      proportional to *n*. In a lifetime of many, many\\n> independent choices, small
      and large, a career with vision will get\\n> you a distance proportional to
      *n*, while no vision will get you only\\n> the distance \u221A*n*. In a sense,
      the main difference between those who\\n> go far and those who do not is some
      people have a vision and the\\n> others do not and therefore can only react
      to the current events as\\n> they happen... having a vision is what tends to
      separate the leaders\\n> from the followers.\\n\\nThis theme permeates his discussion
      of systems engineering: a successful\\nsystems engineer must, at all times,
      keep the overall vision and purpose\\nof the system in mind, so as to optimize
      in the right direction. It also\\nmotivates what problems you must choose:\\n\\n>
      If you do not work on important problems, how can you expect to do\\n> important
      work? Yet direct observation and direct questioning of\\n> people show most
      scientists spend most of their time working on things\\n> they believe are not
      important and are not likely to lead to important\\n> things.\\n\\nIn Hamming's
      view, it seems the precise vision one follows is less\\nimportant than the simple
      act of having a vision at all. Forcing oneself\\nto decide on goals and then
      strive to fulfill them will naturally lead\\nyou to excellence, even if the
      goals you choose aren't the same as the\\none Hamming would have chosen:\\n\\n>
      The chief gain is in the effort to change yourself, in the struggle\\n> with
      yourself, and it is less in the winning than you might expect.\\n> Yes, it is
      nice to end up where you wanted to be, but the person you\\n> are when you get
      there is far more important. I believe a life in\\n> which you do not try to
      extend yourself regularly is not worth\\n> living---but it is up to you to pick
      the goals you believe are worth\\n> striving for.\\n\\n## **4. Should You Read
      This Book?** {#should-you-read-this-book}\\n\\nI began this book review by claiming
      that *The Art of Doing Science and\\nEngineering* isn't a textbook, or a self-help
      book, or a memoir, but\\nfailed to offer a positive vision of what it was. I
      now reveal my true\\nopinion: *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* is
      best viewed as a\\nmodern example of [\\\"wisdom\\nliterature,\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature)
      in the\\nstyle of ancient scriptures.\\n\\nWhy is this? Wisdom literature frequently
      has the curious property that\\nit's accessible only to the wise. For instance,
      the book of Proverbs is\\nostensibly written to convey wisdom to those who seek
      it, but this\\nhardly seems compatible with the following passage (Proverbs
      26:7--9):\\n\\n> Like a lame man\\\\'s legs, which hang useless, is a proverb
      in the mouth\\n> of fools.  \\n> Like one who binds the stone in the sling is
      one who gives honor to a\\n> fool.  \\n> Like a thorn that goes up into the
      hand of a drunkard is a proverb in\\n> the mouth of fools.\\n\\nIf proverbs
      are useless---or worse than useless, a thorn in the hand of\\na drunkard---to
      those without wisdom, then what is the point of\\nproverbs? If only the wise
      can understand your book of wisdom, why\\nbother writing it at all?\\n\\nThere
      are several ways to resolve this tension (one being \\\"the book of\\nProverbs
      is stupid\\\"), but I think the right answer goes something like\\nthis: wisdom
      is accessible to those who seek it, but simply reading\\nthrough a book of wisdom
      isn't sufficient to make one wise. Rather, the\\nsearch for wisdom requires
      discipline and vigilance---one must meditate\\non wise sayings, appreciate the
      underlying principles, and learn to\\ndiscern what's right even in complicated
      circumstances. So, wisdom\\nliterature can help us on the journey to wisdom,
      but ultimately we will\\nhave to take the intellectual burden upon ourselves
      if we hope to get\\nanywhere. (This is roughly how [John Piper interprets\\nProverbs](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-discoveries-begin-as-problems).)\\n\\nViewing
      Hamming's book as essentially modern wisdom literature makes\\nsense of his
      focus on the \\\"style\\\" of thinking, his insistence that the\\nreader must
      rediscover much of what he's saying for themselves, and his\\nadmonitions not
      to accept what he's saying blindly but to think it over\\nat length:\\n\\n>
      You the reader should take your own opinions and try first to express\\n> them
      clearly, and then examine them with counterarguments, back and\\n> forth, until
      *you are fairly clear as to what you believe and why you\\n> believe it*. It
      is none of the author's business in this matter what\\n> you believe, but it
      is the author's business to get you to think and\\n> articulate your position
      clearly. *(emphasis original)*\\n\\nIf we view this book---Hamming's guide to
      future scientists and\\nengineers, his *magnum opus* as a teacher and mentor---as
      wisdom\\nliterature, it implies that wisdom, not any specific technical skill,
      is\\nrate-limiting for technical progress. This is very encouraging, because\\nwisdom,
      unlike innate intelligence, is an acquired trait, and one which\\nwe can all
      cultivate in ourselves. We can't all be Ramanujan or von\\nNeumann, but (at
      least as Hamming tells it) we can all be Hamming.\\n\\nThus far, I've mostly
      given reasons why you should read this book. Why\\nshouldn't you read this book?
      One reason is that this book is aimed at\\nscientists and engineers, and furthermore
      it seems primarily aimed at\\npeople with an interest in the \\\"hard\\\" sciences---much
      of the advice\\nassumes some contact with simulation, math, or physics. So a
      reader\\nwithout at least a glancing interest in these topics might struggle
      to\\nfind some of the content relevant. (But maybe the act of extending his\\nadvice
      to other domains would prompt deeper consideration of the\\nfundamental principles
      at play, and thus serve to cultivate wisdom!)\\n\\nAnother reason you shouldn't
      read this book is that it's very much\\nframed as a personal guide---it addresses
      the needs of an individual\\nscientist, not ideas for how science writ large
      could be improved. So\\naspiring metascientists might be disappointed by Hamming's
      perspective;\\nhe dedicates a lot of time to thinking about how one can navigate\\nimperfect
      organizations, and much less time to thinking about what a\\nperfect organization
      would look like.\\n\\nThe strongest reason for reading this book, though, is
      that the world\\nHamming hopes to write for is almost exactly our world today.
      Hamming\\nanticipates \\\"the inevitable and extensive computerization of your\\norganization
      and society generally,\\\" a world in which scientists are\\nfrequently overwhelmed
      by the \\\"rate of innovation and change of the\\ndominant paradigm,\\\" and
      a world where there is \\\"not time to allow us the\\nleisure which comes from
      separating the two fields\\\" of science and\\nengineering. From my perspective,
      this almost perfectly captures the\\nfeeling of working in science or tech today.\\n\\nAnd
      so Hamming's message---the vision of scientists \\\"trying to achieve\\nexcellence\\\"
      through making \\\"significant contributions to humanity\\\" on\\nimportant
      problems---seems more relevant today than ever. If you\\nyourself work in a
      scientific field, and want to know how to have the\\ngreatest positive impact
      on your own character and on society, then\\nHamming's wisdom is for you: but
      not without some struggle\\n\\n*A transcript of Hamming's talk \\\"You and Your

      was Richard Hamming, and why should you read his book?\\n\\nIf you've taken
      computer science courses or messed around enough with\\n*scipy*, you might recognize
      his name in a few different\\nplaces---[Hamming error-correction\\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code),
      the [Hamming window\\nfunction](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.hamming.html),\\nthe
      [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance),\\nthe [Hamming
      bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_bound), etc. I\\nhad heard of some
      of these concepts, but didn't know anything concrete\\nabout him before I started
      reading this book.\\n\\nHis brief biography is as follows: Richard Hamming (1915--1998)
      studied\\nmathematics at the University of Chicago, earned a PhD in three years\\nfrom
      Illinois, and then started as a professor at the University of\\nLouisville...
      in 1944. He was almost immediately recruited for the\\nManhattan Project, where
      he worked on large-scale simulations of\\nimploding spherical shells of explosives,
      and generally acted as a\\n\\\"computational janitor\\\" for various projects.\\n\\nIn
      1946, he moved to Bell Telephone Laboratories, [\\\"arguably the most\\ninnovative
      research institution in the\\ncountry,\\\"](https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review)\\nand
      worked there until 1976. During his time at Bell Labs, he was\\ninvolved in
      \\\"nearly all of the laboratories\\\\' most prominent\\nachievements\\\"\\n([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)),
      and was\\nrewarded with such accolades as the third-ever Turing Award (essentially\\nthe
      Nobel Prize for computer science) and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming\\nmedal. (You
      know you're successful when someone else names an award\\nafter you!)\\n\\nAfter
      he retired from Bell Labs, Hamming went on to go teach classes at\\nthe Naval
      Postgraduate School. This book---published in 1996, just\\nbefore his death---is
      based on the capstone engineering class he taught\\nthere, which attempted to
      prepare students for their technical future by\\nconveying the \\\"style of
      thinking\\\" necessary to be a great scientist and\\nengineer. Stripe Press
      calls it \\\"a provocative challenge to anyone who\\nwants to build something
      great\\\" and \\\"a manual of style for how to get\\nthere,\\\" while the foreword
      calls it a \\\"tour of scientific greatness\\\"\\nwhich prepares \\\"the next
      generation for even greater greatness\\\" while\\nchallenging them to serve
      the public good.\\n\\nI was excited to read this book because:\\n\\n1.  Hamming
      was present at arguably the two most successful scientific\\n    institutions
      of the 20th century---the Manhattan Project and Bell\\n    Labs---and so was
      witness to more innovative scientific discoveries\\n    than almost anyone today.
      So if anyone has a shot at teaching how to\\n    be an effective scientist,
      it's Hamming.\\n\\n2.  The interface between academic science and real-world
      advances seems\\n    to be one of the most broken elements of the modern research\\n
      \   ecosystem, and I was interested to see what Hamming, as a\\n    self-proclaimed
      scientist and engineer, had to say on the subject.\\n\\n3.  It's a first-hand
      account of the creation of the most important\\n    field of the past century---computer
      science---and thus a way to\\n    witness, albeit second-hand, the important
      process of [scientific\\n    branch-creation](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/when-do-ideas-get-easier-to-find).\\n\\n4.
      \ The book is a chance to see computing, and computer science, as it\\n    was
      before the implications and importance of the field became\\n    obvious, and
      thus a way to understand what a promising area of\\n    research looks like
      without the benefit of hindsight.\\n\\n5.  This is a chance to read frank and
      honest reflections from someone\\n    who both was a great scientist and was
      adjacent to a huge number of\\n    other great scientists, and thus learn about
      the culture of\\n    successful science (especially successful science in the
      mid-20th\\n    century, which might be different than the science of today).\\n\\n##
      **1. What's In The Book?** {#whats-in-the-book}\\n\\n*The Art of Doing Science
      and Engineering* is not a conventional\\ntextbook, but neither is it a self-help
      book, a memoir, or a guide to\\npersonal strategy. The two books that remind
      me of it most are *Godel,\\nEscher, Bach*, by Douglas Hofstadter, and *Zero
      To One*, by Peter Thiel.\\nAll three books are composed of various pseudo-independent
      chapters\\nwhich, in isolation, could likely function as essays, but which echo\\ncertain
      themes over and over again in a way that makes the whole greater\\nthan the
      sum of its parts in a hard-to-summarize way.\\n\\nHamming's goal in structuring
      the book this way is clear, and explicitly\\nstated: he doesn't want to teach
      object-level facts, because the facts\\nneeded to succeed in any discipline
      will inevitably change over the\\ncourse of time. Instead he seeks to teach
      the patterns of thought which\\nwill enable anyone to succeed in an evolving
      technical landscape. To do\\nso, he uses a mix of first-person stories, historical
      reflections,\\nmathematical proofs, and graphs, all with the goal of teaching
      something\\nthat's essentially incommunicable: style. I quote:\\n\\n> I will
      show you my style as best I can, but, again, you must take\\n> those elements
      of it which seem to fit you, and you must finally\\n> create your own style.
      Either you will be a leader or a follower, and\\n> my goal for you is to be
      a leader. You cannot adopt every trait I\\n> discuss in what I have observed
      in myself and others; you must select\\n> and adapt, and make them your own
      if the course is to be effective.\\n\\nDespite Hamming's insistence that there
      is \\\"really no technical content\\\"\\nin the book and that any mathematics
      is only \\\"window dressing,\\\" I found\\nthat my lack of background knowledge
      made several\\nchapters---particularly those on digital filters---quite difficult
      to\\nunderstand.\\n\\n## **2. Representative Anecdotes** {#representative-anecdotes}\\n\\nIn
      keeping with Hamming's desire to convey the \\\"style of thinking\\\"\\nrather
      than actual object-level scientific ideas, I'll share a few\\nanecdotes, insights,
      and quotes in an attempt to reproduce the style of\\nhis writing.\\n\\n### **2.1
      The Second Mouse Gets The Cheese** {#the-second-mouse-gets-the-cheese}\\n\\nHamming
      recounts the invention of interpreters and compilers and then\\nreflects on
      how hard it was for early computer pioneers to think of\\ncomputers as \\\"symbol
      manipulators and not just number crunchers,\\\"\\nobserving that often the first
      people in a field do not understand it as\\nwell as those who come after them.
      Why is this?\\n\\n> The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight
      through so\\n> many dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding
      and\\n> confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is\\n>
      open and the path made easy.... in time the same will probably be true\\n> of
      you.\\n\\nThis is a nice observation, and perhaps explains the value of startups:\\nincumbents
      in a market can be inefficient not only for bureaucratic\\nreasons, but also
      because they're intellectually less suited to see new\\nopportunities---the
      young can see the status quo more clearly than those\\nwho've had to create
      it. This also explains why \\\"really new ideas seldom\\narise from the experts
      in the field\\\"---experts always bring their\\nexpertise when looking at something
      new, which makes them more likely to\\nbe correct, but also disincentivizes
      new ways of thinking and thus\\ncreates a sort of status quo bias.\\n\\n###
      **2.2 Order-of-Magnitude Changes** {#order-of-magnitude-changes}\\n\\nMany people,
      faced with early computers, dismissed them as simply a\\nfaster way to do rote
      calculations---which seems silly in hindsight, but\\nwas a real barrier for
      early computer pioneers to overcome. Hamming\\nargues \\\"a single order of
      magnitude change (a factor of ten) produces\\nfundamentally new effects\\\"
      in any piece of technology, and immediately\\nthereafter reflects on how it's
      difficult for people to accept something\\nnew:\\n\\n> People always want to
      think that something new is just like the\\n> past---they like to be comfortable
      in their minds as well as their\\n> bodies---and hence they prevent themselves
      from making any significant\\n> contribution to the new field being created
      under their noses. Not\\n> everything which is said to be new really is new,
      and it is hard to\\n> decide in some cases when something is new, yet the all
      too common\\n> reaction of \\\"it's nothing new\\\" is stupid.\\n\\nI had previously
      attributed the idea that ten-fold improvement creates a\\nfundamentally new
      product to Peter Thiel (*Zero To One*, pp. 48--49),\\nbut it seems Hamming (as
      usual) got there first.\\n\\n### **2.3 Intuition In High Dimensions** {#intuition-in-high-dimensions}\\n\\nSince
      most complex problems occur in high-dimensional spaces, Hamming\\nillustrates
      a few ways that our 2D or 3D intuition can fail us.\\n\\nOne particularly nice
      thought experiment is this: take a square with\\nside length 4 and divide it
      into four squares, each containing a unit\\ncircle. Now draw a circle in the
      middle of the square, such that the\\ncircle just touches each of the four unit
      circles. Realizing that the\\ndistance from the center of this circle to the
      center of each unit\\ncircle must be \u221A2, and that the radius of the unit
      circle is, of course,\\n1, we can see that the radius of the inner circle must
      be \u221A2 - 1 \u2248\\n0.414.\\n\\nNow, we can perform the same mental exercise
      for a cube with side length\\nfour, and find that the analogous inner sphere
      has side length \u221A3 - 1 \u2248\\n0.732. More generally, as we extend this
      exercise to higher dimensions,\\nwe find that the radius of the inner *n*-dimensional
      hypersphere is\\n\u221A*n* - 1, which is bizarre! For instance, in ten dimensions,
      the inner\\nsphere has radius \u221A10 - 1 \u2248 2.162, meaning that it reaches
      outside of\\nthe surrounding cube:\\n\\n> Yes, the sphere is convex, yes it
      touches each of the 1,024 packed\\n> spheres on the inside, yet it reaches outside
      the cube! So much for\\n> your raw intuition about n-dimensional space, but
      remember the\\n> n-dimensional space is where the design of complex objects
      generally\\n> takes place.\\n\\nThis sort of intuition is difficult to obtain,
      but Hamming gives a few\\nexamples. One that stuck with me was the claim that,
      in high-dimensional\\nshapes, almost all of the volume is on the surface---so
      \\\"almost surely\\nthe optimal design will be on the surface and will not be
      inside, as you\\nmight think from taking the calculus and doing optimizations
      in that\\ncourse.\\\"\\n\\n### **2.4 The Fast Fourier Transform** {#the-fast-fourier-transform}\\n\\nHere's
      a memorable story from Hamming's life:\\n\\n> You have all heard about the fast
      Fourier transform \\\\[FFT\\\\] and the\\n> Tukey-Cooley paper. It is sometimes
      called the *Tukey-Cooley*\\n> transform or algorithm. Tukey had suggested to
      me, sort of, the basic\\n> ideas of the FFT. I had at the time an IBM Card Programmed
      Calculator\\n> (CPC) and the \\\"butterfly\\\" operation meant it was completely\\n>
      impractical to do with the equipment I had. Some years later I had an\\n> internally
      programmed IBM 650 and he remarked on it again. All I\\n> remembered was that
      it was one of Tukey's few bad ideas; I completely\\n> forgot why it was bad---namely
      because of the equipment I had at the\\n> time. So I did not do the FFT, though
      a book I had already published\\n> (1961) shows I knew all the facts necessary,
      and could have done it\\n> easily!  \\n>   \\n> Moral: when you know something
      cannot be done, also remember the\\n> essential reason why, so later, when the
      circumstances have changed,\\n> you will not say \\\"It can't be done.\\\" Think
      of my error! How much more\\n> stupid can anyone be?\\n\\nLater in the book,
      Hamming puts forward the following \\\"old statement\\\"\\nabout experts:\\n\\n>
      If an expert says something can be done he is probably correct, but if\\n> he
      says it is impossible then consider getting another opinion.\\n\\n### **2.5
      The Mixed Blessings of Jargon** {#the-mixed-blessings-of-jargon}\\n\\nHamming
      emphasizes the importance, as an interdisciplinary scientist, of\\nmastering
      the language of the field in which you're working, but warns\\nagainst embracing
      jargon too much. Why? Jargon serves \\\"to facilitate\\ncommunication over a
      restricted area of things or events... \\\\[but\\\\] also\\nblocks thinking
      outside the original area it was designed to cover.\\\" So\\njargon makes intra-domain
      communication easier, but makes inter-domain\\ncommunication harder.\\n\\nMore
      philosophically, jargon is a consequence of how \\\"we have been\\nmainly selected
      by evolution to resent outsiders,\\\" and thus the\\n\\\"instinctive use of
      jargon\\\" is a base instinct that must be consciously\\nresisted.\\n\\n###
      **2.6 Optimal Components, Suboptimal Systems** {#optimal-components-suboptimal-systems}\\n\\nHamming
      discusses the field of systems engineering, which he defines as\\n\\\"the attempt
      to keep at all times the larger goals in mind and to\\ntranslate local actions
      into global results\\\" (emphasis original), and\\ncoins the first rule of systems
      engineering:\\n\\n> If you optimize the components, you will probably ruin the
      system\\n> performance.\\n\\nThis point is illustrated with a few examples.
      One of these examples is\\nthe progressive optimization of calculus and linear
      algebra classes in\\ncollege, where \\\"we have stripped out anything not immediately
      relevant\\nto each course,\\\" leading to \\\"large parts of any mathematical
      education\\nbeing omitted in the urge to optimize the individual courses.\\\"
      Only when\\nthe proper goal of a mathematical education is taken into\\naccount---producing
      well-trained students with a firm grasp of math and\\nthe ability to apply it
      to important problems---can the constituent\\ncourses sanely be optimized.\\n\\nI
      found this idea pretty insightful, and have thought about it a lot\\nsince reading
      this book. For instance, one can see many researchers as\\nover-optimizing for
      \\\"publishing papers\\\" or \\\"winning grants\\\" rather than\\nworking towards
      maximizing total scientific progress. (Alex Danco has a\\ngreat piece discussing
      the same ideas in the context of the Canadian\\ntech ecosystem, which I wrote
      about\\n[here](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221206_definite_games_indefinite_optimism.html).)\\n\\n###
      **2.7 Learning Should Be Difficult** {#learning-should-be-difficult}\\n\\nI
      like this story so much I'll just reproduce it in its entirety:\\n\\n> When
      I first came to the Naval Postgraduate School in 1976 there was a\\n> nice dean
      of the extension division concerned with education. In some\\n> hot discussions
      on education we differed. One day I came into his\\n> office and said I was
      teaching a weightlifting class (which he knew I\\n> was not). I went on to say
      that graduation was lifting 250 pounds, and\\n> I had found many students got
      discouraged and dropped out, some\\n> repeated the course, and a very few graduated.
      I went on to say\\n> thinking this over last night I decided the problem could
      be easily\\n> cured by simply cutting the weights in half---the student in order
      to\\n> graduate, would lift 125 pounds, set them down, and then lift the\\n>
      other 125 pounds, thus lifting the 250 pounds.  \\n>   \\n> I waited a moment
      while he smiled (as you probably have) and I then\\n> observed that when I found
      a simpler proof for a theorem in\\n> mathematics and used it in class, was I
      or was I not cutting the\\n> weights in half? What is your answer? Is there
      not an element of truth\\n> in the observation that the easier we make the learning
      for the\\n> student, the more we are cutting the weights in half?\\n\\nThis
      story reflects a key belief of Hamming's: that creativity and\\ntalent in technical
      disciplines are not innate traits given only to rare\\ngeniuses, but trainable
      skills which anyone can hope to acquire and\\nimprove at, given the appropriate
      training regimen. In Hamming's\\nworldview, staring at a confusing math problem
      is not a sign that you're\\na failure, but the process by which you become successful.\\n\\n###
      **2.8 The Importance of Presentation** {#the-importance-of-presentation}\\n\\nHamming
      emphasizes that being able to \\\"sell\\\" one's ideas is a key part\\nof being
      a scientist:\\n\\n> All \\\\[methods of conveying ideas\\\\] are essential---you
      must learn to\\n> sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear\\n>
      presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists\\n> and
      others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be\\n> carefully
      presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be\\n> rediscovered because
      it was not well presented the first time, years\\n> before! New ideas are automatically
      resisted by the establishment, and\\n> to some extent justly. The organization
      cannot be in a continual state\\n> of ferment and change, but it should respond
      to significant changes.\\n\\nIn this view, a certain degree of institutional
      conservatism is\\nnecessary to avoid being swept up by any new fad (in machine
      learning\\nterms, we might say that organizations need to limit their learning\\nrate),
      and so you alone must convince your peers that your insights are\\nthe real
      deal and deserve to be taken seriously.\\n\\nHamming then extends this idea
      to needing to sell your abilities more\\nbroadly:\\n\\n> You do not hire a plumber
      to learn plumbing while trying to fix your\\n> trouble; you expect he is already
      an expert. Similarly, only when you\\n> have developed your abilities will you
      generally get the freedom to\\n> practice your expertise, whatever you choose
      to make it, including the\\n> expertise of \\\"universality,\\\" as I did.\\n\\nMy
      experience within science is that most people are a bit allergic to\\nthe idea
      of \\\"selling\\\" themselves or their research---with the exception\\nof a
      few people who become almost addicted to it. Hamming (who never\\nshies away
      from quoting a Greek philosopher) would probably think that\\nthere's an Aristotelian
      mean between these two extremes: the ideal\\nscientist/engineer recognizes that
      self-promotion is a necessary means\\nto an end, but never engages in self-promotion
      absent a higher goal.\\n\\n## **3. Overall Themes** {#overall-themes}\\n\\nI
      would summarize Hamming's key themes---those leitmotifs which pop up\\ntime
      and time again in the book---as the following:\\n\\n### **3.1 Fundamentals Are
      Key** {#fundamentals-are-key}\\n\\nWherever possible, try to understand the
      intellectual underpinnings of a\\nfield as well as possible, rather than the
      surface-level results. If you\\ndo so, you will not only understand the field
      better than most of its\\npractitioners, but also be better at transferring
      knowledge between\\nfields. Perceiving \\\"the essential unity of all knowledge
      rather than the\\nfragments which appear as the individual topics are taught\\\"
      allows one\\nto quickly access relevant information to the problem at hand,
      no matter\\nthe field of origin.\\n\\nHamming frequently points out the failings
      of domain experts to perceive\\nthe fundamental underpinnings of their knowledge:\\n\\n>
      Lo and behold, the famous *transfer function* is exactly the\\n> *eigenvalues*
      of the corresponding eigenfunctions! Upon asking various\\n> electrical engineers
      what the transfer function was, no one has ever\\n> told me that! Yes, when
      pointed out to them that it is the same idea\\n> they have to agree, but the
      fact it is the same idea never seemed to\\n> have crossed their minds! The same,
      simple idea, in two or more\\n> different disguises in their minds, and they
      knew of no connection\\n> between them! Get down to the basics every time! *(emphasis
      original)*\\n\\nNot only is a good grasp of fundamentals important for understanding\\nyour
      own domain, it also helps with creativity. Hamming argues that\\ncreative insights
      come from the subconscious, and that \\\"flexible access\\nto pieces of knowledge\\\"
      is the most important way to give the\\nsubconscious the tools it needs to solve
      a problem. This flexible access\\narises from \\\"looking at knowledge while
      you are acquiring it from many\\ndifferent angles,\\\" making sure to capture
      its key features rather than\\nsimply memorizing the aspect relevant to the
      task at hand.\\n\\n(The idea that creativity comes from the subconscious is
      pretty\\ncommon---see, for instance, Nisbett and Wallace's article [\\\"Telling
      More\\nThan We Can\\nKnow,\\\"](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/nisbett%20saying%20more.pdf)\\nwhich
      argues that basically all higher order cognitive processes are\\nsubconscious.)\\n\\n###
      **3.2 Gain Insight Where Possible** {#gain-insight-where-possible}\\n\\nNo matter
      the task at hand, Hamming argues that the correct immediate\\nstep is always
      to gain insight about the situation, and then go from\\nthere. He uses the example
      of Planck and the \\\"ultraviolet catastrophe\\\"\\nto illustrate how crucial
      insight can be:\\n\\n> Max Planck (1858--1947) fit the black-body radiation
      experimental data\\n> with an empirical curve, and it fit so well he \\\"knew\\\"
      it was \\\"the\\n> right formula.\\\" He set out to derive it, but had trouble.
      Finally he\\n> used a standard method of breaking up the energy into finite
      sizes and\\n> then going to the limit... Fortunately for Planck the formula
      fit only\\n> so long as he avoided the limit, and no matter how he took the
      limit\\n> the formula disappeared. He finally, being a very good, honest\\n>
      physicist, decided he had to stop short of the limit, and that is what\\n> defines
      Planck's constant!  \\n>   \\n> *\\\\[another historical paragraph omitted\\\\]*
      \ \\n>   \\n> Before going on, let me discuss how this piece of history has
      affected\\n> my behavior in science. Clearly Planck was led to create the theory\\n>
      because the approximating curve fit so well, and had the proper form.\\n> I
      reasoned, therefore, if I were to help anyone do a similar thing, I\\n> had
      better represent things in terms of functions they believed would\\n> be proper
      for their field rather than in the standard polynomials. I\\n> therefore abandoned
      the standard polynomial approach to approximation,\\n> which numerical analysts
      and statisticians among others use most of\\n> the time, for the harder approach
      of finding which class of functions\\n> I should use.\\n\\nThis episode demonstrates
      how insight can arise from a simulation, and\\nenable future work (like, in
      this case, all of quantum mechanics), and\\nalso illustrates how the manner
      in which one performs simulations can\\nmake it either easier or harder to obtain
      underlying insights about the\\nproblem. Hamming emphasizes this point with
      a few stories from his time\\nat Bell Labs, and argues that there are times
      where more computational\\npower is actually counterproductive:\\n\\n> I have
      often wondered what would have happened \\\\[in the Nike guided\\n> missile
      project\\\\] if I had had a modern, high-speed computer. Would I\\n> ever have
      acquired the feeling for the missile, upon which so much\\n> depended in the
      final design? I often doubt hundreds more trajectories\\n> would have taught

      *(emphasis original)*\\n\\nThis point---that simulation is not the same as understanding---is
      not\\nunique to Hamming (see *inter alia* Roald Hoffmann on the subject:\\n[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201902527),\\n[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910283),\\n[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201910285)),\\nbut
      hearing this from the father of scientific simulation certainly\\ndrives the
      message home!\\n\\n### **3.3 Vision Matters** {#vision-matters}\\n\\nHamming
      goes to great lengths to emphasize the importance of having a\\nvision for your
      life:\\n\\n> It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or
      right\\n> with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about\\n>
      \u221A*n* steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one\\n> direction,
      then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he\\n> will go a distance
      proportional to *n*. In a lifetime of many, many\\n> independent choices, small
      and large, a career with vision will get\\n> you a distance proportional to
      *n*, while no vision will get you only\\n> the distance \u221A*n*. In a sense,
      the main difference between those who\\n> go far and those who do not is some
      people have a vision and the\\n> others do not and therefore can only react
      to the current events as\\n> they happen... having a vision is what tends to
      separate the leaders\\n> from the followers.\\n\\nThis theme permeates his discussion
      of systems engineering: a successful\\nsystems engineer must, at all times,
      keep the overall vision and purpose\\nof the system in mind, so as to optimize
      in the right direction. It also\\nmotivates what problems you must choose:\\n\\n>
      If you do not work on important problems, how can you expect to do\\n> important
      work? Yet direct observation and direct questioning of\\n> people show most
      scientists spend most of their time working on things\\n> they believe are not
      important and are not likely to lead to important\\n> things.\\n\\nIn Hamming's
      view, it seems the precise vision one follows is less\\nimportant than the simple
      act of having a vision at all. Forcing oneself\\nto decide on goals and then
      strive to fulfill them will naturally lead\\nyou to excellence, even if the
      goals you choose aren't the same as the\\none Hamming would have chosen:\\n\\n>
      The chief gain is in the effort to change yourself, in the struggle\\n> with
      yourself, and it is less in the winning than you might expect.\\n> Yes, it is
      nice to end up where you wanted to be, but the person you\\n> are when you get
      there is far more important. I believe a life in\\n> which you do not try to
      extend yourself regularly is not worth\\n> living---but it is up to you to pick
      the goals you believe are worth\\n> striving for.\\n\\n## **4. Should You Read
      This Book?** {#should-you-read-this-book}\\n\\nI began this book review by claiming
      that *The Art of Doing Science and\\nEngineering* isn't a textbook, or a self-help
      book, or a memoir, but\\nfailed to offer a positive vision of what it was. I
      now reveal my true\\nopinion: *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* is
      best viewed as a\\nmodern example of [\\\"wisdom\\nliterature,\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature)
      in the\\nstyle of ancient scriptures.\\n\\nWhy is this? Wisdom literature frequently
      has the curious property that\\nit's accessible only to the wise. For instance,
      the book of Proverbs is\\nostensibly written to convey wisdom to those who seek
      it, but this\\nhardly seems compatible with the following passage (Proverbs
      26:7--9):\\n\\n> Like a lame man\\\\'s legs, which hang useless, is a proverb
      in the mouth\\n> of fools.  \\n> Like one who binds the stone in the sling is
      one who gives honor to a\\n> fool.  \\n> Like a thorn that goes up into the
      hand of a drunkard is a proverb in\\n> the mouth of fools.\\n\\nIf proverbs
      are useless---or worse than useless, a thorn in the hand of\\na drunkard---to
      those without wisdom, then what is the point of\\nproverbs? If only the wise
      can understand your book of wisdom, why\\nbother writing it at all?\\n\\nThere
      are several ways to resolve this tension (one being \\\"the book of\\nProverbs
      is stupid\\\"), but I think the right answer goes something like\\nthis: wisdom
      is accessible to those who seek it, but simply reading\\nthrough a book of wisdom
      isn't sufficient to make one wise. Rather, the\\nsearch for wisdom requires
      discipline and vigilance---one must meditate\\non wise sayings, appreciate the
      underlying principles, and learn to\\ndiscern what's right even in complicated
      circumstances. So, wisdom\\nliterature can help us on the journey to wisdom,
      but ultimately we will\\nhave to take the intellectual burden upon ourselves
      if we hope to get\\nanywhere. (This is roughly how [John Piper interprets\\nProverbs](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-discoveries-begin-as-problems).)\\n\\nViewing
      Hamming's book as essentially modern wisdom literature makes\\nsense of his
      focus on the \\\"style\\\" of thinking, his insistence that the\\nreader must
      rediscover much of what he's saying for themselves, and his\\nadmonitions not
      to accept what he's saying blindly but to think it over\\nat length:\\n\\n>
      You the reader should take your own opinions and try first to express\\n> them
      clearly, and then examine them with counterarguments, back and\\n> forth, until
      *you are fairly clear as to what you believe and why you\\n> believe it*. It
      is none of the author's business in this matter what\\n> you believe, but it
      is the author's business to get you to think and\\n> articulate your position
      clearly. *(emphasis original)*\\n\\nIf we view this book---Hamming's guide to
      future scientists and\\nengineers, his *magnum opus* as a teacher and mentor---as
      wisdom\\nliterature, it implies that wisdom, not any specific technical skill,
      is\\nrate-limiting for technical progress. This is very encouraging, because\\nwisdom,
      unlike innate intelligence, is an acquired trait, and one which\\nwe can all
      cultivate in ourselves. We can't all be Ramanujan or von\\nNeumann, but (at
      least as Hamming tells it) we can all be Hamming.\\n\\nThus far, I've mostly
      given reasons why you should read this book. Why\\nshouldn't you read this book?
      One reason is that this book is aimed at\\nscientists and engineers, and furthermore
      it seems primarily aimed at\\npeople with an interest in the \\\"hard\\\" sciences---much
      of the advice\\nassumes some contact with simulation, math, or physics. So a
      reader\\nwithout at least a glancing interest in these topics might struggle
      to\\nfind some of the content relevant. (But maybe the act of extending his\\nadvice
      to other domains would prompt deeper consideration of the\\nfundamental principles
      at play, and thus serve to cultivate wisdom!)\\n\\nAnother reason you shouldn't
      read this book is that it's very much\\nframed as a personal guide---it addresses
      the needs of an individual\\nscientist, not ideas for how science writ large
      could be improved. So\\naspiring metascientists might be disappointed by Hamming's
      perspective;\\nhe dedicates a lot of time to thinking about how one can navigate\\nimperfect
      organizations, and much less time to thinking about what a\\nperfect organization
      would look like.\\n\\nThe strongest reason for reading this book, though, is
      that the world\\nHamming hopes to write for is almost exactly our world today.
      Hamming\\nanticipates \\\"the inevitable and extensive computerization of your\\norganization
      and society generally,\\\" a world in which scientists are\\nfrequently overwhelmed
      by the \\\"rate of innovation and change of the\\ndominant paradigm,\\\" and
      a world where there is \\\"not time to allow us the\\nleisure which comes from
      separating the two fields\\\" of science and\\nengineering. From my perspective,
      this almost perfectly captures the\\nfeeling of working in science or tech today.\\n\\nAnd
      so Hamming's message---the vision of scientists \\\"trying to achieve\\nexcellence\\\"
      through making \\\"significant contributions to humanity\\\" on\\nimportant
      problems---seems more relevant today than ever. If you\\nyourself work in a
      scientific field, and want to know how to have the\\ngreatest positive impact
      on your own character and on society, then\\nHamming's wisdom is for you: but
      not without some struggle\\n\\n*A transcript of Hamming's talk \\\"You and Your
      Research\\\" (a shorter\\nexposition of some of the ideas discussed above) is
      available\\n[here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html),\\nand*

      kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), probably my favorite way to study\nthe mechanism
      of organic reactions. To summarize at a high level: if the\nbonding around a
      given atom changes over the course of a reaction, then\ndifferent isotopes of
      that atom will react at different rates. The exact\nmagnitude of the effect
      depends on the vibrational modes involved, but\nis often quite different for
      different mechanisms, meaning that you can\ncomputationally predict isotope
      effects for a lot of mechanisms and then\nuse KIE measurements to figure out
      which one is actually happening.\n\nThe trouble is that the magnitude of the
      effect depends on the\ndifference in the mass of the two isotopologues. ^1^H/^2^H
      isotope\neffects are quite large: H reacts up to 7x faster than D (more for\nmechanisms
      that involve quantum tunneling), meaning that it''s not too\nhard to measure
      the value accurately. But as the atom gets heavier, the\neffects get smaller.
      For the next most common pair of\nisotopomers,^12^C/^13^C, the effect is usually
      5% or less.\n\nSmall KIEs are usually measured by one-pot competition experiments:
      a\nmixture of the two isomers is reacted to partial conversion, and then\nthe
      isotopic composition of either the starting material or the product\nis determined.
      The product will be enriched in the isotope that reacts\nmore quickly, and the
      starting material will be enriched in the isotope\nthat reacts more slowly.
      If you know the starting ratio of isotopes, the\nconversion, and the ratio of
      isotopes at partial conversion, then you\ncan use the Bigeleisen\u2212Mayer
      equation to figure out the KIE.\n([This](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.1c07351)
      is a really\ngood review on isotope effects in general, if you want more than
      this\ncursory summary.)\n\nThe accuracy of the KIE measurement is thus limited
      by (1) how\naccurately you can determine conversion and (2) how accurately you
      can\nmeasure the isotopic composition of a sample. Although conversion can be\nannoying,
      the second is the more serious limitation---*a priori* it''s\nnot obvious how
      to figure out what the relative abundance of various\nisotopes is.\n\nToday,
      most people use approaches based on NMR spectroscopy: since ^1^H\nand ^13^C
      are both NMR-active nuclei, you can just integrate the peak of\ninterest against
      another peak to figure out how much there is.\n(Quantitative ^13^C NMR is super
      slow, so\n[various](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621)\n[tricks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-018-0079-7)
      can be\nemployed to speed things up.)\n\nBut there was an age before the advent
      of accurate NMR spectroscopy\nwhere people measured isotope effects differently.
      I was awestruck by\n[this 1975 paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00834a064)
      from\nCromartie and Swain reporting the measurement of a ^35^Cl/^37^Cl isotope\neffect
      in the cyclization of 4-chlorobutanol: they report an isotope\neffect of 1.000757
      \u00b1 0.00015 using hydroxide as base, which they\ndifferentiate from an isotope
      effect of 1.000796 \u00b1 0.00013 using water\nas base by Student''s *t* test.
      These numbers are way, way smaller and\nmore precise than any isotope effect
      I''ve seen measured in the last few\ndecades.\n\nDigging a little deeper reveals
      a\n[whole](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00418a038)\n[wealth](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00426a047)
      of papers\nusing ^35^Cl/^37^Cl isotope effects to study various mechanistic\nphenomena.
      The instrument Swain and others use (described\n[here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jo00972a016))
      is an\nisotope-ratio mass spectrometer, which as the name implies is a special\nsort
      of mass spectrometer designed specifically to measure isotopic\ncomposition.
      These instruments, although a little obscure from my point\nof view, are\n[commercial](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry-irms.html)!\n\nSo,
      why isn''t IRMS used more frequently in organic chemistry today? I\nthink it''s
      for a few reasons. IRMS, at least historically, only works on\ngases, meaning
      that you have to either use gaseous reactants or convert\nyour analytes to gases,
      both of which are pretty annoying. In the Swain\nwork, they (i) incinerate their
      samples with nitric acid, (ii)\nprecipitate out silver chloride by adding silver
      nitrate, and then (iii)\nconvert silver chloride to gaseous methyl chloride
      by [heating with\nmethyl iodide](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00873a025)
      in a\nsealed tube. This is certainly a lot of hassle to put up with for a\nsingle
      measurement---and you generally want to get a good number of\nreplicates.\n\n(There
      are some [all-in-one\nsolutions](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11206175)\navailable
      for sale, which automatically combust samples \u00e0 la elemental\nanalysis,
      but they don''t seem to work on non-standard isotopes like\nchlorine.)\n\nAnother
      reason why IRMS might have fallen out of favor is that it\nrequires a dedicated
      instrument, whereas NMR-based methods can be done\nusing the NMR spectrometers
      that any university already has. Most labs\nonly have budgets for a handful
      of instruments---is an IRMS really worth\nthe investment? (Owing to the typical
      aura of secrecy around instrument\nprices, I''m not sure how much one costs,
      but I''m guessing it''s a few\nhundred thousand dollars or so.)\n\nThese downsides
      notwithstanding, I think there is a lot of good science\nthat could be done
      if a mechanistic group decided to make IRMS a core\npart of their program. In
      particular, ^35^Cl/^37^Cl KIEs seem really\npowerful: there are a growing number
      of organometallic reactions which\ninvolve chlorine atoms in the key step(s),
      and for which Cl KIEs might\nbe complementary or superior to more conventional
      KIEs. I''m envisioning\nstudying [transmetallation from Pd(II)\nchlorides](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad6981),
      or\n[chlorine radical-mediated C--H\nactivation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c13333),
      or\n[photolysis of Ni(II)\nchlorides](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c01356).\n\n(And
      why stop at Cl? According to ThermoFisher, thermal ionization mass\nspectrometry
      lets you analyze the isotopic composition of metals with\nreally high accuracy
      \\[five decimal places, per their\n[brochure](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CMD/brochures/br-30537-triton-xt-tims-br30537-en.pdf)\\].\nWould
      a ^58^Ni/^60^Ni isotope effect be possible to measure? This might\nprovide a
      handle on some mechanistically ambiguous Ni(III) scenarios,\nlike those reported\n[here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13211):
      is radical\ntrapping or reductive elimination rate- and\nenantioselectivity-determining?)\n\nIt
      doesn''t seem like it''s that easy to start a purely mechanistic\nresearch group
      these days, so maybe this is an unfundable idea. But it\nseems sad that a technique
      as powerful for physical (in)organic chemists\nas IRMS could just fade into
      obscurity, and I hope somebody finds the\ntime and resources to apply it to
      modern mechanistic problems.\n", "images": [], "updated_at": 1683899686, "published_at":

      by (1) how\\naccurately you can determine conversion and (2) how accurately
      you can\\nmeasure the isotopic composition of a sample. Although conversion
      can be\\nannoying, the second is the more serious limitation---*a priori* it's\\nnot
      obvious how to figure out what the relative abundance of various\\nisotopes
      is.\\n\\nToday, most people use approaches based on NMR spectroscopy: since
      ^1^H\\nand ^13^C are both NMR-active nuclei, you can just integrate the peak
      of\\ninterest against another peak to figure out how much there is.\\n(Quantitative
      ^13^C NMR is super slow, so\\n[various](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621)\\n[tricks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-018-0079-7)
      can be\\nemployed to speed things up.)\\n\\nBut there was an age before the
      advent of accurate NMR spectroscopy\\nwhere people measured isotope effects
      differently. I was awestruck by\\n[this 1975 paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00834a064)
      from\\nCromartie and Swain reporting the measurement of a ^35^Cl/^37^Cl isotope\\neffect
      in the cyclization of 4-chlorobutanol: they report an isotope\\neffect of 1.000757
      \xB1 0.00015 using hydroxide as base, which they\\ndifferentiate from an isotope
      effect of 1.000796 \xB1 0.00013 using water\\nas base by Student's *t* test.
      These numbers are way, way smaller and\\nmore precise than any isotope effect
      I've seen measured in the last few\\ndecades.\\n\\nDigging a little deeper reveals
      a\\n[whole](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00418a038)\\n[wealth](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00426a047)
      of papers\\nusing ^35^Cl/^37^Cl isotope effects to study various mechanistic\\nphenomena.
      The instrument Swain and others use (described\\n[here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jo00972a016))
      is an\\nisotope-ratio mass spectrometer, which as the name implies is a special\\nsort
      of mass spectrometer designed specifically to measure isotopic\\ncomposition.
      These instruments, although a little obscure from my point\\nof view, are\\n[commercial](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry-irms.html)!\\n\\nSo,
      why isn't IRMS used more frequently in organic chemistry today? I\\nthink it's
      for a few reasons. IRMS, at least historically, only works on\\ngases, meaning
      that you have to either use gaseous reactants or convert\\nyour analytes to
      gases, both of which are pretty annoying. In the Swain\\nwork, they (i) incinerate
      their samples with nitric acid, (ii)\\nprecipitate out silver chloride by adding
      silver nitrate, and then (iii)\\nconvert silver chloride to gaseous methyl chloride
      by [heating with\\nmethyl iodide](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00873a025)
      in a\\nsealed tube. This is certainly a lot of hassle to put up with for a\\nsingle
      measurement---and you generally want to get a good number of\\nreplicates.\\n\\n(There
      are some [all-in-one\\nsolutions](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/11206175)\\navailable
      for sale, which automatically combust samples \xE0 la elemental\\nanalysis,
      but they don't seem to work on non-standard isotopes like\\nchlorine.)\\n\\nAnother
      reason why IRMS might have fallen out of favor is that it\\nrequires a dedicated
      instrument, whereas NMR-based methods can be done\\nusing the NMR spectrometers
      that any university already has. Most labs\\nonly have budgets for a handful
      of instruments---is an IRMS really worth\\nthe investment? (Owing to the typical
      aura of secrecy around instrument\\nprices, I'm not sure how much one costs,
      but I'm guessing it's a few\\nhundred thousand dollars or so.)\\n\\nThese downsides
      notwithstanding, I think there is a lot of good science\\nthat could be done
      if a mechanistic group decided to make IRMS a core\\npart of their program.
      In particular, ^35^Cl/^37^Cl KIEs seem really\\npowerful: there are a growing
      number of organometallic reactions which\\ninvolve chlorine atoms in the key
      step(s), and for which Cl KIEs might\\nbe complementary or superior to more
      conventional KIEs. I'm envisioning\\nstudying [transmetallation from Pd(II)\\nchlorides](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad6981),
      or\\n[chlorine radical-mediated C--H\\nactivation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c13333),
      or\\n[photolysis of Ni(II)\\nchlorides](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c01356).\\n\\n(And
      why stop at Cl? According to ThermoFisher, thermal ionization mass\\nspectrometry

      of organic reactions. To summarize at a high level: if the\\nbonding around
      a given atom changes over the course of a reaction, then\\ndifferent isotopes
      of that atom will react at different rates. The exact\\nmagnitude of the effect
      depends on the vibrational modes involved, but\\nis often quite different for
      different mechanisms, meaning that you can\\ncomputationally predict isotope
      effects for a lot of mechanisms and then\\nuse KIE measurements to figure out
      which one is actually happening.\\n\\nThe trouble is that the magnitude of the
      effect depends on the\\ndifference in the mass of the two isotopologues. ^1^H/^2^H
      isotope\\neffects are quite large: H reacts up to 7x faster than D (more for\\nmechanisms
      that involve quantum tunneling), meaning that it's not too\\nhard to measure
      the value accurately. But as the atom gets heavier, the\\neffects get smaller.
      For the next most common pair of\\nisotopomers,^12^C/^13^C, the effect is usually
      5% or less.\\n\\nSmall KIEs are usually measured by one-pot competition experiments:
      a\\nmixture of the two isomers is reacted to partial conversion, and then\\nthe
      isotopic composition of either the starting material or the product\\nis determined.
      The product will be enriched in the isotope that reacts\\nmore quickly, and
      the starting material will be enriched in the isotope\\nthat reacts more slowly.
      If you know the starting ratio of isotopes, the\\nconversion, and the ratio
      of isotopes at partial conversion, then you\\ncan use the Bigeleisen\u2212Mayer

      a EIE of 0.94 for benzaldehyde in aq. sulfuric acid, and\n[Gajewski and\nco-authors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja982504r)
      compute an\nEIE of 0.83 for acetaldehyde at the MP2/6-31G(d,p) level of theory.
      I\nperformed my own calculations at the M06-2X/jun-cc-pVTZ level of theory\nand
      obtained an EIE of 0.851 with\n[PyQuiver](https://github.com/ekwan/PyQuiver),
      qualitatively consistent\nwith the above results.\n\nWhere does this EIE come
      from? It''s helpful to think of benzaldehyde as\npossessing multiple resonance
      forms:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7c7683-9d0d-4894-9ae2-1906f515b8c0_984x680.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      of the neutral resonance form on the top left, but\nyou can also imagine putting
      a positive charge on carbon and a negative\ncharge on oxygen to create a zwitterion
      with a C--O single bond (bottom\nleft). In neutral benzaldehyde, this resonance
      form is substantially\ndisfavored, but in protonated benzaldehyde it doesn''t
      look any worse\nthan the \"normal\" top resonance form!\n\nIf this is true,
      we''d expect the C--O bond order to decrease from 2 in\nneutral benzaldehyde
      to \\~1.5 in protonated benzaldehyde. Indeed, in my\ncalculations the bond length
      increases from 1.20 \u00c5 to 1.28 \u00c5 upon\nprotonation---so it seems the
      double bond character is decreasing! It''s\nnot quite the same as going from
      sp^2^ to sp^3^, but the inverse KIE\nbegins to make sense.\n\n(This is purely
      guesswork, but my guess would be that the differences\nbetween the two structures
      are attenuated in a polar solvent like water.\nThe zwitterionic resonance form
      of the neutral structure will be\nstabilized and thus the neutral aldehyde will
      be more polar, making the\nchange to the oxocarbenium less drastic. This might
      explain why the\nmeasured EIE in water is smaller---although this might also
      be due to\ncounterion effects, or something completely unrelated.)\n\nLet''s
      go a level deeper. According to\n[Streitwieser](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01542a075),\nsecondary
      KIEs associated with hyperconjugation originate from the\ncreation or destruction
      of the c. 800 cm^-1^ out-of-plane bending\nvibrations of Csp^2^--H hydrogens,
      which are markedly lower in frequency\nthan the c. 1350 cm^-1^ bending vibrations
      associated with Csp^3^--H\nhydrogens.\n\nRaising the frequency of a mode increases
      the energy required to inhabit\nthe ground vibrational state (the \"zero-point
      energy\")---but deuterium\nis heavier and vibrates more slowly, meaning that
      it possesses less ZPE\nand is less affected by these changes. So when an 800
      cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode\ntransforms to a 1350 cm^-1^ sp^3^ mode, the ZPE increases,
      but less for\nD than for H, so D is favored. Conversely, when a 1350 cm^-1^
      sp^3^ mode\ntransforms to a 800 cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode, the ZPE decreases, but less
      for D\nthan for H, so H is favored. (For a more complete explanation, see [this\npresentation
      by Rob\nKnowles](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/RRK-KIE.pdf).)\n\nThis
      effect is complicated for benzaldehyde by the fact that the\nout-of-plane bend
      of the aldehyde couples to the out-of-plane bend of\nthe phenyl ring, so there
      are several modes involving out-of-plane\nvibration of the aldehyde proton.
      When I compared the out-of-plane bend\nof the aldehyde H in both structures,
      I saw only minimal differences:\n771, 963, 1040, and 1051 cm^-1^ for the neutral
      species, as compared to\n790, 1003, and 1061 cm^-1^ for the protonated species.
      These small\ndifferences can''t be responsible for the observed effect.\n\nIn
      contrast, the in-plane C--H bend shows a big change---1430 cm^-1^ for\nbenzaldehyde,
      but 1644 cm^-1^ for the oxocarbenium (it seems to couple\nto the C--O stretch;
      the reduced mass increases from 1.26 amu to 3.52\namu). Applying Streitweiser''s
      formula for estimating the isotope effect\nfor a specific mode gives a pretty
      good match:\n\nkH/kD \u2248 exp(0.187/T \\* \u2206\u03bd) = exp(0.187/298 \\*
      (-214)) = 0.87\n\nI don''t understand this area well enough to comment on why
      there''s a\nchange in the in-plane vibrational frequency and not the out-of-plane\nvibrational
      frequency, nor do I understand how to deconvolute the\neffects of mode-to-mode
      coupling. Nevertheless, this provides a\ntentative physical rationale for the
      observation.\n\nOn a more abstract level, this case study illustrates why isotope\neffects
      are such a good tool. Any transformation that perturbs the\nvibrational frequencies
      of a given molecule can, in principle, be\nmonitored by isotope effects without
      affecting the electronic energy\nsurface at all. So, although the precise nature
      and magnitude of the\neffect might be hard to predict *a priori*, it''s not
      surprising that a\ntransformation as dramatic as protonating a functional group
      produces a\nsizable isotope effect.\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd225881f-1b71-4e69-be8a-b7f17b97fe12_924x250.png",

      the H/D bond isn't involved in the reaction, we won't see a\\nprimary effect;
      so we know we have to be thinking in terms of secondary\\neffects. The most
      common reason to observe a secondary isotope effect is\\nchanges in hybridization:
      sp^3^ to sp^2^ gives a normal effect, whereas\\nsp^2^ to sp^3^ gives an inverse
      effect. From this perspective, it looks\\nlike the effect should be unity, since
      the carbon in question is sp^2^\\nin both structures.\\n\\nReality, however,

      think of the neutral resonance form on the top left, but\\nyou can also imagine
      putting a positive charge on carbon and a negative\\ncharge on oxygen to create
      a zwitterion with a C--O single bond (bottom\\nleft). In neutral benzaldehyde,
      this resonance form is substantially\\ndisfavored, but in protonated benzaldehyde
      it doesn't look any worse\\nthan the \\\"normal\\\" top resonance form!\\n\\nIf
      this is true, we'd expect the C--O bond order to decrease from 2 in\\nneutral
      benzaldehyde to \\\\~1.5 in protonated benzaldehyde. Indeed, in my\\ncalculations
      the bond length increases from 1.20 \xC5 to 1.28 \xC5 upon\\nprotonation---so
      it seems the double bond character is decreasing! It's\\nnot quite the same
      as going from sp^2^ to sp^3^, but the inverse KIE\\nbegins to make sense.\\n\\n(This
      is purely guesswork, but my guess would be that the differences\\nbetween the
      two structures are attenuated in a polar solvent like water.\\nThe zwitterionic
      resonance form of the neutral structure will be\\nstabilized and thus the neutral
      aldehyde will be more polar, making the\\nchange to the oxocarbenium less drastic.
      This might explain why the\\nmeasured EIE in water is smaller---although this
      might also be due to\\ncounterion effects, or something completely unrelated.)\\n\\nLet's
      go a level deeper. According to\\n[Streitwieser](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01542a075),\\nsecondary
      KIEs associated with hyperconjugation originate from the\\ncreation or destruction
      of the c. 800 cm^-1^ out-of-plane bending\\nvibrations of Csp^2^--H hydrogens,
      which are markedly lower in frequency\\nthan the c. 1350 cm^-1^ bending vibrations
      associated with Csp^3^--H\\nhydrogens.\\n\\nRaising the frequency of a mode
      increases the energy required to inhabit\\nthe ground vibrational state (the
      \\\"zero-point energy\\\")---but deuterium\\nis heavier and vibrates more slowly,
      meaning that it possesses less ZPE\\nand is less affected by these changes.
      So when an 800 cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode\\ntransforms to a 1350 cm^-1^ sp^3^ mode, the
      ZPE increases, but less for\\nD than for H, so D is favored. Conversely, when
      a 1350 cm^-1^ sp^3^ mode\\ntransforms to a 800 cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode, the ZPE decreases,
      but less for D\\nthan for H, so H is favored. (For a more complete explanation,
      see [this\\npresentation by Rob\\nKnowles](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/RRK-KIE.pdf).)\\n\\nThis
      effect is complicated for benzaldehyde by the fact that the\\nout-of-plane bend
      of the aldehyde couples to the out-of-plane bend of\\nthe phenyl ring, so there
      are several modes involving out-of-plane\\nvibration of the aldehyde proton.
      When I compared the out-of-plane bend\\nof the aldehyde H in both structures,
      I saw only minimal differences:\\n771, 963, 1040, and 1051 cm^-1^ for the neutral
      species, as compared to\\n790, 1003, and 1061 cm^-1^ for the protonated species.
      These small\\ndifferences can't be responsible for the observed effect.\\n\\nIn
      contrast, the in-plane C--H bend shows a big change---1430 cm^-1^ for\\nbenzaldehyde,
      but 1644 cm^-1^ for the oxocarbenium (it seems to couple\\nto the C--O stretch;
      the reduced mass increases from 1.26 amu to 3.52\\namu). Applying Streitweiser's
      formula for estimating the isotope effect\\nfor a specific mode gives a pretty
      good match:\\n\\nkH/kD \u2248 exp(0.187/T \\\\* \u2206\u03BD) = exp(0.187/298
      \\\\* (-214)) = 0.87\\n\\nI don't understand this area well enough to comment
      on why there's a\\nchange in the in-plane vibrational frequency and not the
      out-of-plane\\nvibrational frequency, nor do I understand how to deconvolute
      the\\neffects of mode-to-mode coupling. Nevertheless, this provides a\\ntentative
      physical rationale for the observation.\\n\\nOn a more abstract level, this
      case study illustrates why isotope\\neffects are such a good tool. Any transformation
      that perturbs the\\nvibrational frequencies of a given molecule can, in principle,
      be\\nmonitored by isotope effects without affecting the electronic energy\\nsurface
      at all. So, although the precise nature and magnitude of the\\neffect might
      be hard to predict *a priori*, it's not surprising that a\\ntransformation as
      dramatic as protonating a functional group produces a\\nsizable isotope effect.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"120069573\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      sp^3^ to sp^2^ gives a normal effect, whereas\\nsp^2^ to sp^3^ gives an inverse

      think of the neutral resonance form on the top left, but\\nyou can also imagine
      putting a positive charge on carbon and a negative\\ncharge on oxygen to create
      a zwitterion with a C--O single bond (bottom\\nleft). In neutral benzaldehyde,
      this resonance form is substantially\\ndisfavored, but in protonated benzaldehyde
      it doesn't look any worse\\nthan the \\\"normal\\\" top resonance form!\\n\\nIf
      this is true, we'd expect the C--O bond order to decrease from 2 in\\nneutral
      benzaldehyde to \\\\~1.5 in protonated benzaldehyde. Indeed, in my\\ncalculations
      the bond length increases from 1.20 \xC5 to 1.28 \xC5 upon\\nprotonation---so
      it seems the double bond character is decreasing! It's\\nnot quite the same
      as going from sp^2^ to sp^3^, but the inverse KIE\\nbegins to make sense.\\n\\n(This
      is purely guesswork, but my guess would be that the differences\\nbetween the
      two structures are attenuated in a polar solvent like water.\\nThe zwitterionic
      resonance form of the neutral structure will be\\nstabilized and thus the neutral
      aldehyde will be more polar, making the\\nchange to the oxocarbenium less drastic.
      This might explain why the\\nmeasured EIE in water is smaller---although this
      might also be due to\\ncounterion effects, or something completely unrelated.)\\n\\nLet's
      go a level deeper. According to\\n[Streitwieser](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01542a075),\\nsecondary
      KIEs associated with hyperconjugation originate from the\\ncreation or destruction
      of the c. 800 cm^-1^ out-of-plane bending\\nvibrations of Csp^2^--H hydrogens,
      which are markedly lower in frequency\\nthan the c. 1350 cm^-1^ bending vibrations
      associated with Csp^3^--H\\nhydrogens.\\n\\nRaising the frequency of a mode
      increases the energy required to inhabit\\nthe ground vibrational state (the
      \\\"zero-point energy\\\")---but deuterium\\nis heavier and vibrates more slowly,
      meaning that it possesses less ZPE\\nand is less affected by these changes.
      So when an 800 cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode\\ntransforms to a 1350 cm^-1^ sp^3^ mode, the
      ZPE increases, but less for\\nD than for H, so D is favored. Conversely, when
      a 1350 cm^-1^ sp^3^ mode\\ntransforms to a 800 cm^-1^ sp^2^ mode, the ZPE decreases,
      but less for D\\nthan for H, so H is favored. (For a more complete explanation,
      see [this\\npresentation by Rob\\nKnowles](https://macmillan.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/RRK-KIE.pdf).)\\n\\nThis
      effect is complicated for benzaldehyde by the fact that the\\nout-of-plane bend
      of the aldehyde couples to the out-of-plane bend of\\nthe phenyl ring, so there
      are several modes involving out-of-plane\\nvibration of the aldehyde proton.
      When I compared the out-of-plane bend\\nof the aldehyde H in both structures,
      I saw only minimal differences:\\n771, 963, 1040, and 1051 cm^-1^ for the neutral
      species, as compared to\\n790, 1003, and 1061 cm^-1^ for the protonated species.
      These small\\ndifferences can't be responsible for the observed effect.\\n\\nIn
      contrast, the in-plane C--H bend shows a big change---1430 cm^-1^ for\\nbenzaldehyde,
      but 1644 cm^-1^ for the oxocarbenium (it seems to couple\\nto the C--O stretch;
      the reduced mass increases from 1.26 amu to 3.52\\namu). Applying Streitweiser's
      formula for estimating the isotope effect\\nfor a specific mode gives a pretty
      good match:\\n\\nkH/kD \u2248 exp(0.187/T \\\\* \u2206\u03BD) = exp(0.187/298
      \\\\* (-214)) = 0.87\\n\\nI don't understand this area well enough to comment
      on why there's a\\nchange in the in-plane vibrational frequency and not the
      out-of-plane\\nvibrational frequency, nor do I understand how to deconvolute
      the\\neffects of mode-to-mode coupling. Nevertheless, this provides a\\ntentative
      physical rationale for the observation.\\n\\nOn a more abstract level, this
      case study illustrates why isotope\\neffects are such a good tool. Any transformation
      that perturbs the\\nvibrational frequencies of a given molecule can, in principle,
      be\\nmonitored by isotope effects without affecting the electronic energy\\nsurface
      at all. So, although the precise nature and magnitude of the\\neffect might
      be hard to predict *a priori*, it's not surprising that a\\ntransformation as
      dramatic as protonating a functional group produces a\\nsizable isotope effect.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"120069573\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      wonder what the error bars on my life choices are. What are\nthe chances I ended
      up a chemist? A scientist of any type? Having two\nchildren in graduate school?\n\nIf
      I had the ability, I would want to restart the World Simulator from\nthe time
      I started high school, run a bunch of replicates, and see what\nhappened to
      me in different simulations. And this wouldn''t just be\nuseful for me personally---there
      are lots of things in the world that\nare just as contingent and path-dependent
      as one''s life choices. What\nwould have happened if Charles the Bold hadn''t
      died in 1477 and Burgundy\nhad preserved its independence? If the 1787 convention
      were rerun\nseveral times, how might the US Constitution differ?\n\nSadly, we''ll
      never know the answer to these questions. But what we can\ndo instead is find
      cases in which analogous institutions evolved in\nparallel, and try to learn
      from the similarities and differences between\nthem. It''s an imperfect substitute
      for rerunning the World Simulator,\nbut it''s still pretty cool. (This is far
      from an original idea: see for\ninstance *[Legal Systems Very Different From\nOurs](https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Systems-Very-Different-Ours/dp/1793386722/)*.)\n\nLately,
      I''ve come to think about the tech/startup world as somewhat\nparallel to academic
      science in this manner. Why? For one, both tech and\nacademia deal with hard
      problems that demand obscure/arcane\ndomain-specific knowledge inaccessible
      to non-experts. (It''s true that\nthe problems are typically scientific in academia
      and\nengineering-related in tech, but I''ve argued\n[previously](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\nthat
      this distinction is flimsier than it seems.) And in both fields, a\nfew high
      performers [vastly outperform](https://nadia.xyz/top-talent)\nthe rest of the
      field, be it a \"10x engineer\" or a Nobel laureate.\n\nStartups, like academic
      labs, are small and agile institutions which\nface the task of raising money,
      building a team, selecting a hard yet\nsolvable problem, and finding a solution
      all within a few years. In both\ncases, too, there are nonlinear returns to
      success: moderate success is\nnot much better than failure, pushing founders/assistant
      professors to\nbe as ambitious as possible.\n\nIf we accept these two fields
      as vaguely analogous, what interesting\ndifferences can we observe?\n\n### **Startups
      Have Multiple Founders**\n\nI''ll quote from [an essay by Paul\nGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html),
      founder of Y\nCombinator and noted startup sage:\n\n> Have you ever noticed
      how few successful startups were founded by just\n> one person? Even companies
      you think of as having one founder, like\n> Oracle, usually turn out to have
      more. It seems unlikely this is a\n> coincidence.  \n>   \n> What\\''s wrong
      with having one founder? To start with, it\\''s a vote of\n> no confidence.
      It probably means the founder couldn\\''t talk any of his\n> friends into starting
      the company with him. That\\''s pretty alarming,\n> because his friends are
      the ones who know him best.  \n>   \n> But even if the founder\\''s friends
      were all wrong and the company is a\n> good bet, he\\''s still at a disadvantage.
      Starting a startup is too\n> hard for one person. Even if you could do all the
      work yourself, you\n> need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of
      stupid\n> decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.\n\nEver since
      I read this, I''ve wondered why no labs ever have multiple\nPIs. I guess this
      would mess with the semi-feudal organization of\nuniversity bureaucracy, but
      it doesn''t seem intrinsically bad---after\nall, lots of startups seem to do
      just fine.\n\n### **Startup Winners Can''t Be Picked** ***Ex Ante***\n\nThe
      VC strategy, as I understand it, is basically \"fund a bunch of\ncompanies,
      and one or two of them will make it all worth our while.\"\nThis is a little
      bit different than how universities approach hiring\nassistant professors: each
      university will typically hire a small number\nof professors each year, after
      much deliberation, and they have a pretty\nhigh likelihood of giving them tenure,
      at least relative to the\nlikelihood of any given startup succeeding. (Basically,
      [startups are\nr-selected, whereas academic labs are\nK-selected.](https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/r_and_k_selection/r_and_k.html))\n\nThere
      are a lot of reasons why this might be. For one, faculty members\naren''t just
      trying to pick a winner but also their future colleague, so\npersonal considerations
      probably matter more. Failure in science seems\nmore cruel, too: while a failed
      startup founder can often negotiate the\n\"sale\" of their company and parlay
      that into new jobs and the constant\nchurn of tech means that there are always
      new openings for talented\nex-startup employees, a lab that doesn''t get tenure
      takes a toll on\nprofessor and students alike.\n\nA hypothesis for why the success
      rate for new labs is so much higher\nthan the success rate for new businesses
      is that many labs only succeed\na little bit. They don''t actually achieve what
      they dreamed about in\ntheir initial proposals, but they pivot and accrue enough
      publications\nand cachet to earn tenure nevertheless. In business, it seems
      harder to\nsucceed a little bit---the market is a harsher critic than one''s
      peers.\n\n### **Founders Should Be Focused**\n\nPaul Graham again, this time
      talking about [the dangers of\nfundraising](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html):\n\n>
      Raising money is terribly distracting. You\\''re lucky if your\n> productivity
      is a third of what it was before. And it can last for\n> months.  \n>   \n>
      I didn\\''t understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising money\n>
      was so distracting till earlier this year. I\\''d noticed that startups\n> we
      funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched to raising\n> money,
      but I didn\\''t remember exactly why till YC raised money itself.\n> We had
      a comparatively easy time of it; the first people I asked said\n> yes; but it
      took months to work out the details, and during that time\n> I got hardly any
      real work done. Why? Because I thought about it all\n> the time.\n\nThe broader
      conclusion, from this and other essays, is that any\ndistractions from the core
      mission of the startup are very dangerous,\nand should be avoided at all costs.
      This is very different from the\nlifestyle of new PIs, who are typically juggling
      departmental\nresponsibilities, writing a curriculum, lecturing for the first
      time,\nand writing grants all while trying to get their lab up and running.\n\n###
      **Talent Acquisition Is Crucial**\n\nIn tech, people obsess about recruiting
      the best people possible---I\nreviewed [a whole book about\nthis](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220928_talent.html)\nlast
      year. Hiring bad programmers is \\#6 on PG''s [list of mistakes that\nkill startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html),
      and\nthere seems to be a general consensus that a great company takes great\nengineers,
      no matter what.\n\nIn contrast, professors don''t have full control over whom
      they hire (for\ngraduate students), making recruiting much harder. Graduate
      students are\nselected through a complex two-stage system involving admission
      to a\nschool and then a subsequent group-joining process (and new assistant\nprofessors
      sometimes aren''t even around for the first of these stages).\nYou can obviously
      try to coax talented students to work for you, but the\npool of accepted students
      interested in your subfield might be tiny, and\nthey might all prefer to work
      for an established group...\n\n(Plus, there''s not a good way to reward top
      performers in academia. All\ngraduate students are equal, at least on paper---you
      can''t give someone\na year-end bonus, or a promotion.)\n\nA nice concrete example
      of this is how professors [struggle to hire\ncompetent\nprogrammers](https://www.jefftk.com/p/hiring-programmers-in-academia),\neven
      as research scientists---they aren''t allowed to pay enough to match\nmarket
      rates, even when the expense would be well worth the money. To\nquote [Bret\nDevereaux](https://acoup.blog/2023/04/28/collections-academic-ranks-explained-or-what-on-earth-is-an-adjunct/?s=03#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18391):\n\"academic
      hiring, to be frank, is not conducted seriously\" (he''s\ndiscussing the humanities,
      but the point stands).\n\n### **Successful Startups Grow**\n\nAs a startup succeeds,
      it grows: while a seed-stage startup typically\nhas \\<15 people, startups at
      Series A often have 20--40, and startups at\nSeries B--C might have as many
      as 300 employees ([one\nref](https://www.quora.com/How-many-employees-do-early-stage-startups-have);\nrough
      numbers broadly consistent with other sources). Good companies\ngrow, while
      bad ones die.\n\nIn contrast, it''s rare for even the most successful US academic
      labs to\ngrow past 30 people (although [it occasionally\nhappens](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA195680544&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00280836&p=HRCA&sw=w&userGroupName=mlin_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true)),\nlimiting
      the reach of top-performing professors. While a huge proportion\nof tech employees
      work for the best companies (Google, Meta, Amazon,\netc), only a very small
      number of students work for the best professors.\n\n### **Concluding Thoughts**\n\nThe
      imperfect nature of the analogy means that some of these points\nmight not be
      useful in a normative sense: universities are not really\noptimized to produce
      research as efficiently as possible, and maybe\nthat''s fine. Likewise, startups
      aren''t optimized to produce unprofitable\nresearch or train future scientists,
      even if these activities may in the\nlong run be beneficial. (This is [why basic
      science is considered a\npublic\ngood](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220728_consulting_as_grad_school.html#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20the%20government%20sponsors%20research%20into%20interesting%20problems%20with%20uncertain%20timeframes%20to%20do%20what%20the%20free%20market%20cannot),\nand
      why the government funds it at all!)\n\nNevertheless, I think there''s a lot
      that scientists can learn from\nstartups. There is a whole army of people working
      to solve challenging\ntechnical problems in the most efficient way, and it''d
      be prudent to\nstudy the wisdom that emerges.\n\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen and Jacob

      we can\ndo instead is find cases in which analogous institutions evolved in\nparallel,
      and try to learn from the similarities and differences between\nthem. It''s
      an imperfect substitute for rerunning the World Simulator,\nbut it''s still
      pretty cool. (This is far from an original idea: see for\ninstance *[Legal Systems
      Very Different From\nOurs](https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Systems-Very-Different-Ours/dp/1793386722/)*.)\n\nLately,
      I''ve come to think about the tech/startup world as somewhat\nparallel to academic
      science in this manner. Why? For one, both tech and\nacademia deal with hard
      problems that demand obscure/arcane\ndomain-specific knowledge inaccessible
      to non-experts. (It''s true that\nthe problems are typically scientific in academia
      and\nengineering-related in tech, but I''ve argued\n[previously](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\nthat
      this distinction is flimsier than it seems.) And in both fields, a\nfew high
      performers [vastly outperform](https://nadia.xyz/top-talent)\nthe rest of the
      field, be it a \"10x engineer\" or a Nobel laureate.\n\nStartups, like academic
      labs, are small and agile institutions which\nface the task of raising money,
      building a team, selecting a hard yet\nsolvable problem, and finding a solution
      all within a few years. In both\ncases, too, there are nonlinear returns to
      success: moderate success is\nnot much better than failure, pushing founders/assistant
      professors to\nbe as ambitious as possible.\n\nIf we accept these two fields
      as vaguely analogous, what interesting\ndifferences can we observe?\n\n### **Startups
      Have Multiple Founders**\n\nI''ll quote from [an essay by Paul\nGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html),
      founder of Y\nCombinator and noted startup sage:\n\n> Have you ever noticed
      how few successful startups were founded by just\n> one person? Even companies
      you think of as having one founder, like\n> Oracle, usually turn out to have
      more. It seems unlikely this is a\n> coincidence.  \n>   \n> What\\''s wrong
      with having one founder? To start with, it\\''s a vote of\n> no confidence.
      It probably means the founder couldn\\''t talk any of his\n> friends into starting
      the company with him. That\\''s pretty alarming,\n> because his friends are
      the ones who know him best.  \n>   \n> But even if the founder\\''s friends
      were all wrong and the company is a\n> good bet, he\\''s still at a disadvantage.
      Starting a startup is too\n> hard for one person. Even if you could do all the
      work yourself, you\n> need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of
      stupid\n> decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.\n\nEver since
      I read this, I''ve wondered why no labs ever have multiple\nPIs. I guess this
      would mess with the semi-feudal organization of\nuniversity bureaucracy, but
      it doesn''t seem intrinsically bad---after\nall, lots of startups seem to do
      just fine.\n\n### **Startup Winners Can''t Be Picked** ***Ex Ante***\n\nThe
      VC strategy, as I understand it, is basically \"fund a bunch of\ncompanies,
      and one or two of them will make it all worth our while.\"\nThis is a little
      bit different than how universities approach hiring\nassistant professors: each
      university will typically hire a small number\nof professors each year, after
      much deliberation, and they have a pretty\nhigh likelihood of giving them tenure,
      at least relative to the\nlikelihood of any given startup succeeding. (Basically,
      [startups are\nr-selected, whereas academic labs are\nK-selected.](https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/r_and_k_selection/r_and_k.html))\n\nThere
      are a lot of reasons why this might be. For one, faculty members\naren''t just
      trying to pick a winner but also their future colleague, so\npersonal considerations
      probably matter more. Failure in science seems\nmore cruel, too: while a failed
      startup founder can often negotiate the\n\"sale\" of their company and parlay
      that into new jobs and the constant\nchurn of tech means that there are always
      new openings for talented\nex-startup employees, a lab that doesn''t get tenure
      takes a toll on\nprofessor and students alike.\n\nA hypothesis for why the success
      rate for new labs is so much higher\nthan the success rate for new businesses
      is that many labs only succeed\na little bit. They don''t actually achieve what
      they dreamed about in\ntheir initial proposals, but they pivot and accrue enough
      publications\nand cachet to earn tenure nevertheless. In business, it seems
      harder to\nsucceed a little bit---the market is a harsher critic than one''s
      peers.\n\n### **Founders Should Be Focused**\n\nPaul Graham again, this time

      and\nengineering-related in tech, but I''ve argued\n[previously](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\nthat
      this distinction is flimsier than it seems.) And in both fields, a\nfew high
      performers [vastly outperform](https://nadia.xyz/top-talent)\nthe rest of the
      field, be it a \"10x engineer\" or a Nobel laureate.\n\nStartups, like academic
      labs, are small and agile institutions which\nface the task of raising money,
      building a team, selecting a hard yet\nsolvable problem, and finding a solution
      all within a few years. In both\ncases, too, there are nonlinear returns to
      success: moderate success is\nnot much better than failure, pushing founders/assistant
      professors to\nbe as ambitious as possible.\n\nIf we accept these two fields
      as vaguely analogous, what interesting\ndifferences can we observe?\n\n### **Startups
      Have Multiple Founders**\n\nI''ll quote from [an essay by Paul\nGraham](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html),
      founder of Y\nCombinator and noted startup sage:\n\n> Have you ever noticed
      how few successful startups were founded by just\n> one person? Even companies
      you think of as having one founder, like\n> Oracle, usually turn out to have
      more. It seems unlikely this is a\n> coincidence.  \n>   \n> What\\''s wrong
      with having one founder? To start with, it\\''s a vote of\n> no confidence.
      It probably means the founder couldn\\''t talk any of his\n> friends into starting
      the company with him. That\\''s pretty alarming,\n> because his friends are
      the ones who know him best.  \n>   \n> But even if the founder\\''s friends
      were all wrong and the company is a\n> good bet, he\\''s still at a disadvantage.
      Starting a startup is too\n> hard for one person. Even if you could do all the
      work yourself, you\n> need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of
      stupid\n> decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.\n\nEver since
      I read this, I''ve wondered why no labs ever have multiple\nPIs. I guess this
      would mess with the semi-feudal organization of\nuniversity bureaucracy, but
      it doesn''t seem intrinsically bad---after\nall, lots of startups seem to do
      just fine.\n\n### **Startup Winners Can''t Be Picked** ***Ex Ante***\n\nThe
      VC strategy, as I understand it, is basically \"fund a bunch of\ncompanies,
      and one or two of them will make it all worth our while.\"\nThis is a little
      bit different than how universities approach hiring\nassistant professors: each
      university will typically hire a small number\nof professors each year, after
      much deliberation, and they have a pretty\nhigh likelihood of giving them tenure,
      at least relative to the\nlikelihood of any given startup succeeding. (Basically,
      [startups are\nr-selected, whereas academic labs are\nK-selected.](https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/r_and_k_selection/r_and_k.html))\n\nThere
      are a lot of reasons why this might be. For one, faculty members\naren''t just
      trying to pick a winner but also their future colleague, so\npersonal considerations
      probably matter more. Failure in science seems\nmore cruel, too: while a failed
      startup founder can often negotiate the\n\"sale\" of their company and parlay
      that into new jobs and the constant\nchurn of tech means that there are always
      new openings for talented\nex-startup employees, a lab that doesn''t get tenure
      takes a toll on\nprofessor and students alike.\n\nA hypothesis for why the success
      rate for new labs is so much higher\nthan the success rate for new businesses
      is that many labs only succeed\na little bit. They don''t actually achieve what
      they dreamed about in\ntheir initial proposals, but they pivot and accrue enough
      publications\nand cachet to earn tenure nevertheless. In business, it seems
      harder to\nsucceed a little bit---the market is a harsher critic than one''s
      peers.\n\n### **Founders Should Be Focused**\n\nPaul Graham again, this time
      talking about [the dangers of\nfundraising](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html):\n\n>
      Raising money is terribly distracting. You\\''re lucky if your\n> productivity
      is a third of what it was before. And it can last for\n> months.  \n>   \n>
      I didn\\''t understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising money\n>
      was so distracting till earlier this year. I\\''d noticed that startups\n> we
      funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched to raising\n> money,
      but I didn\\''t remember exactly why till YC raised money itself.\n> We had
      a comparatively easy time of it; the first people I asked said\n> yes; but it
      took months to work out the details, and during that time\n> I got hardly any
      real work done. Why? Because I thought about it all\n> the time.\n\nThe broader
      conclusion, from this and other essays, is that any\ndistractions from the core
      mission of the startup are very dangerous,\nand should be avoided at all costs.
      This is very different from the\nlifestyle of new PIs, who are typically juggling
      departmental\nresponsibilities, writing a curriculum, lecturing for the first
      time,\nand writing grants all while trying to get their lab up and running.\n\n###
      **Talent Acquisition Is Crucial**\n\nIn tech, people obsess about recruiting
      the best people possible---I\nreviewed [a whole book about\nthis](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220928_talent.html)\nlast
      year. Hiring bad programmers is \\#6 on PG''s [list of mistakes that\nkill startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html),
      and\nthere seems to be a general consensus that a great company takes great\nengineers,
      no matter what.\n\nIn contrast, professors don''t have full control over whom
      they hire (for\ngraduate students), making recruiting much harder. Graduate
      students are\nselected through a complex two-stage system involving admission
      to a\nschool and then a subsequent group-joining process (and new assistant\nprofessors
      sometimes aren''t even around for the first of these stages).\nYou can obviously
      try to coax talented students to work for you, but the\npool of accepted students
      interested in your subfield might be tiny, and\nthey might all prefer to work
      for an established group...\n\n(Plus, there''s not a good way to reward top
      performers in academia. All\ngraduate students are equal, at least on paper---you
      can''t give someone\na year-end bonus, or a promotion.)\n\nA nice concrete example
      of this is how professors [struggle to hire\ncompetent\nprogrammers](https://www.jefftk.com/p/hiring-programmers-in-academia),\neven
      as research scientists---they aren''t allowed to pay enough to match\nmarket
      rates, even when the expense would be well worth the money. To\nquote [Bret\nDevereaux](https://acoup.blog/2023/04/28/collections-academic-ranks-explained-or-what-on-earth-is-an-adjunct/?s=03#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18391):\n\"academic
      hiring, to be frank, is not conducted seriously\" (he''s\ndiscussing the humanities,
      but the point stands).\n\n### **Successful Startups Grow**\n\nAs a startup succeeds,
      it grows: while a seed-stage startup typically\nhas \\<15 people, startups at
      Series A often have 20--40, and startups at\nSeries B--C might have as many
      as 300 employees ([one\nref](https://www.quora.com/How-many-employees-do-early-stage-startups-have);\nrough
      numbers broadly consistent with other sources). Good companies\ngrow, while
      bad ones die.\n\nIn contrast, it''s rare for even the most successful US academic
      labs to\ngrow past 30 people (although [it occasionally\nhappens](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA195680544&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00280836&p=HRCA&sw=w&userGroupName=mlin_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true)),\nlimiting
      the reach of top-performing professors. While a huge proportion\nof tech employees
      work for the best companies (Google, Meta, Amazon,\netc), only a very small
      number of students work for the best professors.\n\n### **Concluding Thoughts**\n\nThe
      imperfect nature of the analogy means that some of these points\nmight not be
      useful in a normative sense: universities are not really\noptimized to produce
      research as efficiently as possible, and maybe\nthat''s fine. Likewise, startups
      aren''t optimized to produce unprofitable\nresearch or train future scientists,
      even if these activities may in the\nlong run be beneficial. (This is [why basic
      science is considered a\npublic\ngood](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220728_consulting_as_grad_school.html#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20the%20government%20sponsors%20research%20into%20interesting%20problems%20with%20uncertain%20timeframes%20to%20do%20what%20the%20free%20market%20cannot),\nand
      why the government funds it at all!)\n\nNevertheless, I think there''s a lot
      that scientists can learn from\nstartups. There is a whole army of people working
      to solve challenging\ntechnical problems in the most efficient way, and it''d
      be prudent to\nstudy the wisdom that emerges.\n\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen and Jacob

      of the most distinctive parts of science, relative to other fields,\nis the
      practice of communicating findings through peer-reviewed journal\npublications.
      Why do scientists communicate in this way? As I see it,\nscientific journals
      provide three important services to the community:\n\n1.  Journals help scientists
      communicate; they disseminate scientific\n    results to a broad audience, both
      within one''s community and to a\n    broader scientific audience.\n\n2.  Through
      the peer review process, journals ensure scientific\n    correctness and keep
      standards high. You never know which of your\n    scientific adversaries might
      be scrutinizing your work for flaws, so\n    you''re incentivized to do the
      best job possible.\n\n3.  Journals, and peer review, help scientists to read
      high-quality,\n    impactful work by filtering out low-impact papers (even those
      which\n    are scientifically correct). This makes journals a somewhat \"fair\"\n    way
      to score the importance of publications without being a\n    subject-matter
      expert; I might not know what''s happening these days\n    with topological
      quantum materials, but if I see three\n    *Science*/*Nature* papers on a CV,
      I''ll certainly pay attention!\n\n(There are certainly other services that journals
      provide, like DOIs and\ntypesetting, but these seem much less important to me.)\n\nIn
      this post, I want to (1) discuss the problems with scientific\njournals today,
      (2) briefly summarize the history of journals and\nexplain how they came to
      be the way they are today, and (3) imagine how\njournals might evolve in the
      coming decades to adapt to the changing\nlandscape of science. My central claim
      is that the scientific journal,\nas defined by the above criteria, has only
      existed since about the\n1970s, and will probably not exist for very much longer---and
      that''s ok.\n(I''ll also try and explain the esoteric meme at the top.)\n\n##
      **1. Journals Present** {#journals-present}\n\nMany people are upset about scientific
      journals today, and for many\ndifferent reasons.\n\n### **1.1 Profits and Paywalls**
      {#profits-and-paywalls}\n\nThe business model of scientific journals is, to
      put it lightly,\nunusual. [Writing\nfor](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\n*[The\nGuardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)*,\nStephen
      Buranyi describes how \"scientific publishers manage to duck most\nof the actual
      costs\" that normal magazines incur by outsourcing their\neditorial duties to
      scientists: the very people who both write and read\nthe articles:\n\n> It is
      as if the New Yorker or the Economist demanded that journalists\n> write and
      edit each other''s work for free, and asked the government to\n> foot the bill.
      Outside observers tend to fall into a sort of stunned\n> disbelief when describing
      this setup. A 2004 parliamentary science and\n> technology committee report
      on the industry drily observed that \"in a\n> traditional market suppliers are
      paid for the goods they provide\". A\n> 2005 Deutsche Bank report referred to
      it as a \"bizarre\" \"triple-pay\"\n> system, in which \"the state funds most
      research, pays the salaries of\n> most of those checking the quality of research,
      and then buys most of\n> the published product\".\n\nAnd this cost-dodging is
      very successful: scientific journals are a huge\nmoneymaker, with Elsevier (one
      of the largest publishers) having a\nmargin [in excess of\n30%](https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing),\nand
      ACS''s \"information services\" (publication) division close behind,\n[with
      a profit margin of\n27%](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/aboutacs/financial/2022-audited-financial-statements.pdf).\n\nThe
      exorbitant fees charged by journals, and the concomitantly huge\nprofits they
      earn, have led to increasing pushback against the\npaywall-based status quo.
      The Biden administration [has\ncalled](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1)
      for all\ngovernment-funded research to be free-to-read without any embargo by\n2025,
      and other countries have been pursuing similar policies [for some\ntime](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/eu-and-uk-bitten-by-the-open-access-bug/5236.article).\nSimilarly,\n[MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611)\nand
      [the UC\nsystem](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-uc-split-publishing-giant-elsevier)\nrecently
      terminated their subscriptions to Elsevier over open-access\nissues. (And the
      rise of SciHub means that, even without a subscription,\nmost scientists can
      still read almost any article they\nwant---threatening to completely destroy
      the closed-access model.)\n\nIn response to this pressure, journals have begun
      offering open-access\nalternatives, where the journal''s fees are paid by the
      submitting author\nrather than the reader. While in theory this is a solution
      to this\nproblem, in practice the fees for authors are so high that it''s not
      a\nvery good solution. The board of editors of NeuroImage [recently\nresigned](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
      over their\njournal''s high open-access fees---and they''re [not the\nfirst](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00135-8)
      board of\neditors to do this. As [a\n2019](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\n*[Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)*\n[summary](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\nput
      it: \"Publishers are still going to get paid. Open access just means\nthe paychecks

      **1.2 Efficacy of Peer Review** {#efficacy-of-peer-review}\n\nIn parallel, the
      [\"replication\ncrisis\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)
      has led to\ngrowing skepticism about the value of peer review. In his article
      [\"The\nRise and Fall of Peer\nReview,\"](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review)\nAdam
      Mastroianni describes how experiments to measure its value have\nyielded dismal
      outcomes:\n\n> Scientists have run studies where they deliberately add errors
      to\n> papers, send them out to reviewers, and simply count how many errors\n>
      the reviewers catch. Reviewers are pretty awful at this. In [this\n> study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019606449870006X?casa_token=D5MklJnYP0MAAAAA:CzyYl8VLg-M-bvKIHxl7vWCIh8AVrkTUizQ9LZPZWh_eVT5jLf3WJlGaJQzYCsHMraF5Fh8mqw)\n>
      reviewers caught 30% of the major flaws, in [this\n> study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/187748)\n>
      they caught 25%, and in [this\n> study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1258/jrsm.2008.080062)\n>
      they caught 29%. These were critical issues, like \"the paper claims to\n> be
      a randomized controlled trial but it isn''t\" and \"when you look at\n> the
      graphs, it''s pretty clear there''s no effect\" and \"the authors draw\n> conclusions
      that are totally unsupported by the data.\" Reviewers\n> mostly didn''t notice.\n\nWhile
      the worst of the replication crisis seems to be contained to the\nsocial sciences,
      my own field---chemistry---is by no means exempt. As I\nwrote\n[previously](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html),\n\"[elemental

      **1.3 Preprint Servers** {#preprint-servers}\n\nThe rise of preprint servers
      like arXiv, BioRxiv, and ChemRxiv also\nmeans journals aren''t necessary for
      communication of scientific results.\nMore and more, preprints dominate discussions
      of cutting-edge science,\nwhile actual peer-reviewed publications lag months
      to years behind.\n\nWhile in theory preprints aren''t supposed to be viewed
      as scientifically\nauthoritative---since they haven''t been reviewed---in practice
      most\npreprints are qualitatively identical to the peer-reviewed papers that\nthey
      give rise to. [A retrospective\nanalysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285)\nof
      early COVID preprints found that the vast majority of preprints\nsurvived peer
      review without any substantive changes to their\nconclusions (although this
      might be biased by the fact that the worst\npre-prints will never be accepted
      at all.)\n\nIf this is the case, why bother with journals at all? To a growing\ndegree
      this seems to be the norm in CS and CS-adjacent fields: the\nlandmark Google
      transformer paper from 2017, [\"Attention Is All You\nNeed,\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
      is still just a PDF on\narXiv six years later, despite being potentially the
      most impactful\ndiscovery of the 2010s. Similarly, UMAP, [which I discussed
      last\nweek,](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230417_dimensionality_reduction.html)\nis
      also just [hanging out on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426),\nno peer-reviewed
      publication in sight. Still, in chemistry and other\nsciences we''re expected
      to publish in \"real journals\" if we want to\ngraduate or get jobs.\n\n###
      **1.4 Impact-Neutral Reviewing** {#impact-neutral-reviewing}\n\nAn implicit
      assumption of the scientific journal is that high-impact\npublications can be
      distinguished from low-impact publications without\nthe benefit of hindsight.
      Yet many of the most impactful scientific\ndiscoveries---like the Krebs cycle,
      the weak interaction, lasers,\ncontinental drift, and CRISPR---[were\nrejected](https://nintil.com/discoveries-ignored)
      when first submitted\nto journals. How is this possible?\n\nI''d argue that
      peer review creates a bias towards incrementalism. It''s\neasy to see how an
      improvement over something already known is\nsignificant; it''s perhaps harder
      to appreciate the impact of a\nfield-defining discovery, or to believe that
      such a result could even be\npossible. To quote Antonio Garcia Martinez on startups:
      \"If your idea is\nany good, it won''t get stolen, you''ll have to jam it down
      people''s\nthroats instead.\" True zero-to-one thinking can provoke a strong\nreaction
      from the establishment, and rarely a positive one.\n\n(It''s worth noting that
      some of the highest profile organic chemistry\npapers from 2022 were new takes
      on old, established, reactions:\n[Parasram](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.2c05648)
      and\n[Leonori''s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05211-0)\n\"ozonolysis
      without ozone\" and\n[Nagib''s](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo6443)
      \"carbenes\nwithout diazoalkanes.\" I love both papers---but I also think it''s
      easier\nfor audiences to appreciate why \"ozonolysis without ozone\" is a big
      deal\nthan to process an entirely new idea.)\n\nEven for more quotidian scientific
      results, the value of impact-based\npeer review is limited. Matt Clancy at *[New
      Things Under the\nSun](https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/nc5341ua/release/3)*\nwrites
      that, for preprints, paper acceptance is indeed correlated with\nnumber of eventual
      citations, but that the correlation is weak:\nreviewers seem to be doing better
      than random chance, but worse than we\nmight hope. (Similar results emerge when
      studying the efficacy of peer\nreview for grants.) On the aggregate, it does
      seem true that the average\n*JACS* paper is better than the average *JOC* paper,
      but the trend is\nfar from monotonic.\n\nThese concerns aren''t just mine; indeed,
      a growing number of scientists\nseek to reject impact-based refereeing altogether.
      The [\"impact-neutral\nreviewing\"](http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/2016/01/writing-impact-neutral-review.html?m=1&s=03)\nmovement
      thinks that papers should be evaluated only on the basis of\ntheir scientific
      correctness, not their perceived potential impact.\nAlthough I wouldn''t say
      this is a mainstream idea, journals like *[PLOS\nOne](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information)*,\n*[Frontiers](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/)*,
      and\n*[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research)*\nhave
      adopted versions of it, and perhaps more journals will follow in\nthe years
      to come.\n\nTaken together, these anecdotes demonstrate that all three pillars
      of\nthe modern scientific journal---communication, peer review, and\nimpact-based
      sorting---are threatened today.\n\n## **2. Journals Past** {#journals-past}\n\nHow
      did we get here?\n\nThe importance of journals as a filter for low-quality work
      is a modern\nphenomenon. Of course, editors have always had discretion over
      what to\npublish, but until fairly recently [the total volume of papers was
      much\nlower](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490),\nmeaning
      that it wasn''t so vital to separate the wheat from the chaff. In\nfact, [Stephen\nBuranyi](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\nattributes
      the modern obsession with impact factor and prestige to the\nfounding of *Cell*
      in 1974:\n\n> \\[*Cell*\\] was edited by a young biologist named Ben Lewin,
      who\n> approached his work with an intense, almost literary bent. Lewin\n> prized
      long, rigorous papers that answered big questions -- often\n> representing years
      of research that would have yielded multiple papers\n> in other venues -- and,
      breaking with the idea that journals were\n> passive instruments to communicate
      science, he rejected far more\n> papers than he published....  \n>   \n> Suddenly,
      where you published became immensely important. Other\n> editors took a similarly
      activist approach in the hopes of replicating\n> *Cell*''s success. Publishers
      also adopted a metric called \"impact\n> factor,\" invented in the 1960s by
      Eugene Garfield, a librarian and\n> linguist, as a rough calculation of how
      often papers in a given\n> journal are cited in other papers. For publishers,
      it became a way to\n> rank and advertise the scientific reach of their products.
      The\n> new-look journals, with their emphasis on big results, shot to the top\n>
      of these new rankings, and scientists who published in \"high-impact\"\n> journals
      were rewarded with jobs and funding. Almost overnight, a new\n> currency of
      prestige had been created in the scientific world.\n\nAs Buranyi reports, the
      changes induced by *Cell* rippled across the\njournal ecosystem. The acceptance
      rate at *Nature* [dropped from 35% to\n13%](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)\nover
      the following decade-and-a-half (coincidentally also the years when\npeer review
      was introduced), making journal editors the \"kingmakers of\nscience\" (Buranyi).\n\nPeer
      review is also a modern addition. In *[Physics\nToday](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3463)*,\nMelissa
      Baldwin recounts how peer review only became ubiquitous\nfollowing a series
      of contentious House subcommittee hearings in 1974\nthat questioned the value
      of NSF-funded science:\n\n> Spending on both basic and applied research had
      increased dramatically\n> in the 1950s and 1960s---but when doubts began to
      creep in about the\n> public value of the work that money had funded, scientists
      were faced\n> with the prospect of losing both public trust and access to research\n>
      funding. Legislators wanted publicly funded science to be accountable;\n> scientists
      wanted decisions about science to be left in expert hands.\n> Trusting peer
      review to ensure that only the best and most essential\n> science received funding
      seemed a way to split the difference.\n\nOur expectation that journals ought
      to validate the correctness of the\nwork they publish, too, is quite modern.
      Baldwin again:\n\n> It also seems significant that refereeing procedures were
      not\n> initially developed to detect fraud or to ensure the accuracy of\n> scientific
      claims.... Authors, not referees, were responsible for the\n> contents of their
      papers. It was not until the 20th century that\n> anyone thought a referee should
      be responsible for the quality of the\n> scientific literature, and not until
      the Cold War that something had\n> to be peer-reviewed to be seen as scientifically
      legitimate.\n\nIf journals didn''t do peer review and they didn''t do (as much)\nimpact-based
      filtering before the 1970s, what *did* they do? The answer\nis simple: communication.
      Scientists started communicating in journals\nbecause writing books was too
      slow, and it was important that they be\nable to share results and get feedback
      on their ideas quickly. This was\na founding aim of *Nature*:\n\n> ...to aid
      Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of\n> all advances made
      in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the\n> world, and by affording
      them an opportunity of discussing the various\n> Scientific questions which
      arise from time to time.\n\nAlthough perhaps underwhelming to a modern audience,
      this makes sense.\nScientists back in the day didn''t have preprints, Twitter,
      or Zoom---so\nthey published journal articles because it was \"one of the fastest
      ways\nto bring a scientific issue or idea to their fellow researchers''\nattention\"\n([ref](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)),\nnot
      because it would look good on their CV. Journals became \"the place\nto discuss
      big science questions\" among researchers, and frequently\nfeatured acrimonious
      and public disputes between researchers---far from\ncelebrated storehouses of
      truth, journals were simply the social media\nof pre-communication age scientists.\n\n##
      **3. Journals'' Future?** {#journals-future}\n\nSo, is the solution \"reject
      modernity, embrace tradition\"? Should we go\nback to the way things used to
      be and stop worrying about whether\npublished articles are correct or impactful?\n\nAnyone
      who''s close to the scientific publishing process knows that this\nwould be
      ridiculous and suicidal. We''ve come a long way from the\nintimate scientific
      community of 18th-century England, where scientists\nhad reputations to uphold
      and weren''t incentivized to crank out a bunch\nof *Tet. Lett.* papers. Like
      it or not, today''s scientists have been\ntrained to think of their own productivity
      in terms of publications, and\nthe editorial standards we have today are just
      barely keeping a sea of\nlow-quality crap at bay (cf. [Goodhart''s\nLaw](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490)).\nSometimes
      it feels like peer reviewers are the only people who are\nwilling to give me
      honest criticism about my work---if we get rid of\nthem, what then?\n\nWe can
      understand the changes in journals by borrowing some thinking\nfrom economics:
      as the scale of communities increases, the norms and\ninstitutions of the community
      must progress from informal to formal.\nThis process [has been documented\nnicely](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/development-of-property-rights-on-frontiers-endowments-norms-and-politics/23F4D5DB23AE6EC415ADF049F6CD0B54)\nfor
      the development of property rights on frontiers: at first, land is\nabundant,
      and no property rights are necessary. Later on, inhabitants\ndevelop a *de facto*
      system of informal property rights to mediate\ndisputes---and still later, these
      *de facto* property rights are\ntransformed into *de jure* property rights,
      raising them to the status\nof law. Communities with 10,000 people need more
      formal institutions\nthan communities with 100 people.\n\nIf we revisit the
      history of scientific journals, we can see an\nanalogous process taking place.
      Centuries ago there were relatively few\nscientists, and so journals could simply
      serve as a bulletin board for\nwhatever these scientists were up to. As the
      scale and scope of science\nexpanded in the late 20th century, peer review became
      a way to deal with\nthe rising number of scientific publications, sorting the
      good from the\nbad and providing feedback. Today, as the scale of science continues
      to\nincrease and the communication revolution renders many of the historical\nfunctions
      of journals moot, it seems that journals will have to change\nagain, to adapt
      to the new needs of the community.\n\nTo the extent that this post has a key
      prediction, it''s this: scientific\njournals are going to change a lot in the
      decade or two to come. If\nyou''re a scientist today---even a relatively venerable
      one---you''ve\nlived your whole career in the post-peer review era, and so I
      think\npeople have gotten used to the status quo. Submitting papers to\njournals,
      getting referee reviews, etc are part of what we''re taught\n\"being a scientist\"
      means. But this hasn''t always been true, and it may\nnot be true within your
      lifetime!\n\nSadly, I don''t really have a specific high-confidence prediction
      for how\njournals will change, or how they should change. Instead, I want to\nsketch
      out nine little vignettes of what could happen to journals, good\nor bad. These
      options are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively\nexhaustive; it''s meant
      simply as an exercise in creativity, and to\nprovide a little basis set with
      which to imagine the future.\n\nI''ll repost the initial image of the post here,
      for ambiance, and then\nwalk through the possibilities.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d6953d-9702-4717-b086-e7116c0e8ef8_1152x1210.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      as Bastion of Verified Truth** {#the-journal-as-bastion-of-verified-truth}\n\nOne
      scenario is that journals, no longer being needed to distribute\nresults widely,
      will double down on their role as defenders of\nscientific correctness. To a
      much greater degree, journals will focus on\nonly publishing truly correct work,
      and thus make peer review their key\n\"value add.\" This is already being done
      post-replication crisis in some\nfields; Michael Nielsen and Kanjun Qiu describe
      the rise of \"Registered\nReports\" in their [essay on\nmetascience](https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/):\n\n>
      The idea \\[behind Registered Reports\\] is for scientists to design\n> their
      study in advance: exactly what data is to be taken, exactly what\n> analyses
      are to be run, what questions asked. That study design is\n> then pre-registered
      publicly, and before data is taken the design is\n> refereed at the journal.
      The referees can\\''t know whether the results\n> are \\\"interesting\\\", since
      no data has yet been taken. There are (as\n> yet) no results! Rather, they\\''re
      looking to see if the design is\n> sound, and if the questions being asked are
      interesting -- which is\n> quite different to whether the answers are interesting!
      If the paper\n> passes this round of peer review, only then are the experiments
      done,\n> and the paper completed.\n\nThis makes more sense for medicine or psychology
      than it does for more\nexploratory sciences---if you''re blundering around synthesizing
      novel\nlow-valent Bi complexes, it''s tough to know what you''ll find or what\nexperiments
      you''ll want to run! But there are other ways we could make\nscience more rigorous,
      if we wanted to.\n\nA start would be requiring original datafiles (e.g. for
      NMR spectra)\ninstead of just providing a PDF with images, and having reviewers\nexamine
      these data. ACS has made some moves in this direction\n([e.g.](https://publish.acs.org/publish/data_policy)),
      although to my\nknowledge no ACS journal yet requires original data. One could
      also\nimagine requiring all figures to be linked to the underlying data, with\ncode
      supplied by the submitting group (like a Jupyter notebook). A more\ndrastic
      step would be to require all results to be independently\nreproduced by another
      research group,\n[like](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx) *[Organic\nSyntheses](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx)*\n[does](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx).\n\nThese
      efforts would certainly make the scientific literature more\naccurate, but at
      what cost? Preparing publications already consumes an\nexcessive amount of time
      and energy, and making peer review stricter\nmight just exacerbate this problem.
      Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy\ndiscuss this in a nice\n[perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206685/)
      on\nperverse incentives in modern science:\n\n> Assuming that the goal of the
      scientific enterprise is to maximize\n> true scientific progress, a process
      that overemphasizes quality might\n> require triple or quadruple blinded studies,
      mandatory replication of\n> results by independent parties, and peer-review
      of all data and\n> statistics before publication---such a system would minimize
      mistakes,\n> but would produce very few results due to overcaution.\n\nIt seems
      good that there are some \"overcautious\" journals, like *Org.\nSyn.*, but it
      also seems unlikely that all of science will adopt this\nmodel. In fact, a move
      in this direction might create a two-tiered\nsystem: some journals would adopt
      stringent policies, but there''s a huge\nincentive for some journals to defect
      and avoid these policies, since\nauthors are lazy and would prefer not to do
      extra work. It seems\nunlikely that all of science could realistically be moved
      to a \"bastion\nof truth\" model in the near future, although perhaps we could
      push the\nneedle in that direction.\n\n### **3.2 The Journal as Guild-Approved
      Periodical** {#the-journal-as-guild-approved-periodical}\n\nIf peer review is
      so vital, why not make it a real career? Imagine a\nworld in which journals
      like *Nature* and *Science* have their own\nin-house experts, recruited to serve
      as professional overseers and\ncustodians of science. Instead of your manuscript
      getting sent to some\nrandom editor, and thence to whomever deigns to respond
      to that editor''s\nrequest for reviewers, your manuscript would be scrutinized
      by a team of\nhand-picked domain specialists. This would certainly cost money,
      but\njournals seem to have a bit of extra cash to spare.\n\nI call this scenario
      the \"guild-approved periodical\" because the\nprofessionals who determined
      which papers got published would\nessentially be managers, or leaders, of science---they
      would have a good\namount of power over other scientists, to a degree that seems
      uncommon\ntoday. Thus, this model would amount to a centralization of science:
      if\n*Nature* says you have to do genomics a certain way, you have to do it\nthat
      way or *Nature* journals won''t publish your work! I''m not sure\nwhether this
      would be good or bad.\n\n(It is a little funny that the editors of high-tier
      journals---arguably\nthe most powerful people in their field---are chosen without
      the\nknowledge or consent of the field, through processes that are completely\nopaque
      to rank-and-file scientists. To the extent that this proposal\nallows scientists
      to choose their own governance, it might be good.)\n\n### **3.3 The Journal
      as Living Knowledge Aggregator** {#the-journal-as-living-knowledge-aggregator}\n\nThis
      scenario envisions a world in which \"publications\" are freed from\nthe tyranny
      of needing to be complete at a certain point. While that was\ntrue in the days
      when you actually got a published physical issue in the\nmail, it''s not necessary
      in the Internet age! Instead, one can imagine a\ndynamic process of publishing,
      where a journal article is continually\nupdated in response to new data.\n\nA
      2020 article in\n*[FACETS](https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0012)*\nproposes
      exactly this model:\n\n> The paper of the future may be a digital-only document
      that is not\n> only discussed openly after the peer-review process but also
      regularly\n> updated with time-stamped versions and complementary research by\n>
      different authors... Living systematic reviews are another valuable\n> way to
      keep research up to date in rapidly evolving fields. The papers\n> of the future
      that take the form of living reviews can help our\n> understanding of a topic
      keep pace with the research but will also add\n> complexities. *(citations removed
      from passage)*\n\nThe idea of the living systematic review is being tried out
      by the\n*[Living Journal of Computational Molecular\nScience](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031)*,\nwhich
      (among other things) has published a 60-page [review of enhanced\nsampling methods
      in\nMD](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031),\nwhich
      will continue being updated as the field evolves.\n\nThese ideas are cool, but
      I wonder what would happen if more research\nbecame \"living.\" Disputes and
      acrimony are part of the collective\nprocess of scientific truth-seeking. What
      will happen if bitter rivals\nstart working on the same \"living\" publications---who
      will adjudicate\ntheir disputes?\n\nWikipedia manages to solve this problem
      through a plethora of editors,\nwho can even lock down particularly controversial
      pages, and perhaps\neditors of living journals will assume analogous roles.
      But the ability\nof our collective scientific intelligence to simultaneously
      believe\ncontradictory ideas seems like a virtue, not a vice, and I worry that\nliving
      journals will squash this.\n\nAn even thornier question is who adjudicates questions
      of impact. The\nenhanced sampling review linked above has over 400 references,
      making it\na formidable tome for a non-expert like myself. There''s a lot of
      merit\nin a non-comprehensive and opinionated introduction to the field, which\ntakes
      some subjective editorial liberties, but it''s not clear to me how\nthat would
      work in a collaborative living journal. What''s to stop me\nfrom linking to
      my own papers everywhere?\n\n(I''m sure that there are clever organizational
      and administrative\nsolutions to these problems; I just don''t know what they
      are.)\n\n### **3.4 The Journal as Curated Scientific Vision** {#the-journal-as-curated-scientific-vision}\n\nIf
      \"objective impact\" is so hard to determine fairly, why not just\naccept that
      we''re basically just subjectively scoring publications based\non how much we
      like them, and abandon the pretense of objectivity? One\ncan imagine the rise
      of a new kind of figure: the editor with authorial\nlicense, who has a specific
      vision for what they think science should\nlook like and publishes work in keeping
      with that vision. The role is as\nmuch aesthetic as it is analytic.\n\nThere''s
      some historical precedent for this idea---Eric Gilliam''s written\nabout how
      Warren Weaver, a grant director for the Rockefeller\nFoundation, essentially
      [created the field of molecular\nbiology](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/a-report-on-scientific-branch-creation)\n*ex
      nihilo* by following an opinionated thesis about what work ought to\nbe funded.
      Likewise, one can envision starting a journal as an act of\ncommunity-building,
      essentially creating a Schelling point for\nlike-minded scientists to collaborate,
      share results, and develop a\ncommon approach to science.\n\nWe can see hints
      of this today: newsletters like [\"Some Items of\nInterest to Process\nChemists\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.3c00060)
      or Elliot\nHershberg''s *[Century of Bio](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)*\n[Substack](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)
      highlight a\nparticular vision of science, although they haven''t quite advanced
      to\nthe stage of formally publishing papers themselves. But perhaps it will\nhappen
      soon; new movements, like molecular editing or digital chemistry,\nmight benefit
      from forming more tightly-knit communities.\n\n### **3.5 The Journal as Post
      Hoc Impact Archive** {#the-journal-as-post-hoc-impact-archive}\n\nIf preprints
      take over every field of science as thoroughly as they have\ncomputer science,
      journals may find themselves almost completely\ndivorced from the day-to-day
      practice of science, for better or for\nworse. Papers might still be submitted
      to journals, and the status of\nthe journal might still mean something, but
      it wouldn''t be a guess\nanymore---journals could simply accept the advances
      already proven to be\nimpactful and basically just publish a nicely formatted
      \"version of\nrecord,\" like a scientific Library of Congress.\n\nThis is essentially
      equivalent to the \"publish first, curate second\"\nproposal of [Stern and\nO''Shea](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116)---preprints\neliminate
      the need for journals to move quickly, so we can just see what\nwork the community
      finds to be best and collect that into journals. The\nvalue of journals for
      specialists, who already need to be reading a\nlarge fraction of the papers
      in their area, would be much\nlower---journals would mainly be summarizing a
      field''s achievements for\nthose out-of-field. In this scenario, \"many specialized
      journals that\ncurrently curate a large fraction of the literature will become\nobsolete.\"\n\n(This
      already happens sometimes; I remember chuckling at the 2020 Numpy\n*Nature*
      [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2).\nNumpy isn''t successful
      because it was published in *Nature*; Numpy got\ninto *Nature* because it was
      already successful.)\n\n### **3.6 The Journal as Antediluvian Status Symbol**
      {#the-journal-as-antediluvian-status-symbol}\n\nPessimistically, one can imagine
      a world in which journal publications\nstill carry weight with the \"old guard\"
      and certain sentimental types,\nbut the scientific community has almost completely
      moved to preprints\nfor day-to-day communication. In this scenario, one might
      still have to\npublish journal articles to get a job, but it''s just a formality,
      like a\ndissertation: the active work of science is done through preprints.
      Like\nBlockbuster, journals might limp along for some time, but their fate is\npretty
      much sealed.\n\n### **3.7 The Journal as Philanthropic Pravda** {#the-journal-as-philanthropic-pravda}\n\nAnother
      reason why journals might persist in a world driven by preprints\nis the desire
      of philanthropic agencies to appear beneficent. If a\ncertain organization,
      public or private, is giving tens of millions of\ndollars to support scientific
      progress, the only real reward it can reap\nin the short term is the prestige
      of having its name associated with a\ngiven discovery. Why not go one step further
      and control the means of\npublication?\n\nIn this *Infinite Jest*-like vision,
      funding a certain project buys you\nthe right to publish its results in your
      own journal. We can imagine *J.\nPfizer-Funded Research* and *J. Navy Research*
      competing to fund and\npublish the most exciting work in a given area, since
      no one wants to\nsponsor a loser. (Why stop there? Why not name things after
      corporate\nsponsors? We could have the Red Bull--Higgs Boson, or the\nWittig--Genentech
      olefination.)\n\nAs discussed at the beginning of this article, the government
      \"funds\nmost research, pays the salaries of most of those checking the quality\nof
      research, and then buys most of the published product.\" There''s a\ncertain
      simplicity in a funding agency just taking over the whole\nprocess, but I doubt
      this would be good for scientists. Unifying the\nroles of funder, publisher,
      and editor would probably lower the agency\nof actual researchers to an untenably
      low level.\n\n### **3.8 The Journal as Rent-Seeking Data Troll** {#the-journal-as-rent-seeking-data-troll}\n\nAnother
      depressing scenario is one in which journals cease contributing\nto the positive
      progress of science, and start essentially just trying\nto monetize their existing
      intellectual property. As ML and AI become\nmore important, legal ownership
      of data rights will presumably increase\nin economic value, and one can easily
      imagine the Elseviers of the world\nvacuuming up any smaller journals they can
      and then charging exorbitant\nfees for access to their data. (Goodbye, Reaxys...)\n\nI
      hope this doesn''t happen.\n\n### **3.9 No Journals; Just an Anarchic Preprint
      Lake** {#no-journals-just-an-anarchic-preprint-lake}\n\nThe obvious alternative
      to these increasingly far-fetched scenarios is\nalso the simplest; we get rid
      of journals all together, and---just like\nin the 1700s---rely solely on communication-style
      preprints on arXiv,\nbioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc. This has been termed a \"preprint
      lake,\" in\nanalogy to [\"data lakes.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake)\n\nTo
      help scientists make sense of the lake, one can envision some sort of\npreprint
      aggregator: a Reddit or Hacker News for science, which sorts\npapers by audience
      feedback and permits\n[PubPeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubPeer)-type
      public comments on\nthe merits and shortcomings of each publication. The home
      page of\nReddit-for-papers could serve as the equivalent to *Science*; the\nchemistry-specific
      subpage, the equivalent to *JACS*. Peer review could\nhappen in a decentralized
      fashion, and reviews would be public for all\nto see.\n\nThere''s an anarchic
      appeal to this proposal, but it has potential\ndrawbacks too:\n\n1.  For those
      not immersed in a given field, it''s very difficult to know\n    what''s good
      research and what isn''t. This is doubly true for\n    non-scientists---what
      will become of high-school students trying to\n    write papers?\n\n2.  Existing
      status symbols will become more important absent journal\n    status. To quote
      [Luis Pedro\n    Coelho](https://luispedro.substack.com/p/against-publication-lakes-glam-journals?s=03):\n\n>
      I mostly read preprints by people whose names I already recognize.\n> When thousands
      of papers are thrown into the \"level playing field\" of\n> biorxiv, pre-existing
      markers of prestige end up taking an even\n> greater role.\n\n1.  This presumably
      will disadvantage up-and-coming scientists, or\n    scientists without access
      to existing networks of prestige. That\n    being said, one might make the same
      arguments for the Internet, and\n    the real effect seems to have been exactly
      the opposite! So I''m not\n    quite sure how to think about this.\n\n2.  What
      \"goes viral\" may not always be what''s the best science. Rarely\n    do thoughtful
      or contemplative ideas rise to popularity out of the\n    unstructured morass
      of the Internet, and I find it na\u00efve to expect\n    that scientists would
      be any different here. That being said, the\n    wisdom of crowds might be the
      lesser of two evils, given that our\n    current system is basically \"ask three
      random rivals in the field.\"\n\n3.  There are also just so many papers out
      there today that it might\n    just become overwhelming, even to specialists.
      I miss papers in \"my\n    areas\" constantly, and I try pretty hard to keep
      up with the\n    literature! (Some have proposed that [AI might help us sift
      through\n    things](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1514),\n    but
      AI might also help people write more papers faster---tough to\n    say who will
      win.)\n\n4.  Without the implicit threat of peer review, standards might ebb\n    across
      the board. I think this is a real concern, but it''s possible\n    that the
      same community norms enforced through today''s peer review\n    might also be
      enforced through whatever decentralized review process\n    replaces it. [There''s
      some\n    evidence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-013-9420-1)\n    that,
      in knowledge industries with high information asymmetry (like\n    science),
      communities tend to spontaneously develop strong systems\n    of self-regulation.\n\n##
      **4. Conclusion: Archipelagic Multiverse** {#conclusion-archipelagic-multiverse}\n\nThe
      most likely scenario, to me, is that all of this sorta happens\nsimultaneously.
      Most cutting-edge scientific discussion will move to the\nanarchic world of
      preprints, but there will still be plenty of room for\nmore traditional journals:
      some journals will have very high standards\nand represent the [magisterium
      of scientific\nauthority](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/),\nwhile
      other journals will act as living repositories of knowledge and\nstill others
      will become subjectively curated editorial statements.\n\nWe can see journals
      moving in different directions even today: some\njournals are indicating that
      they''ll start requiring original data and\nimplement more aggressive fraud
      detection, while others are moving away\nfrom impact-based reviewing. And I
      can''t help but notice that it seems\nto be increasingly acceptable to cite
      preprints in publications,\nsuggesting that the needle might be moving towards
      the \"anarchic\npreprint lake\" scenario ever so slightly.\n\nFor my part, I
      plan to continue writing and submitting papers as\nnecessary, reviewing papers
      when asked, and so forth---but I''m excited\nfor the future, and to see how
      the new world order compares to the old.\n\n*Thanks to Melanie Blackburn, Jonathan
      Wong, Joe Gair, and my wife for\nhelpful discussions, and Ari Wagen, Taylor

      of the most distinctive parts of science, relative to other fields,\\nis the
      practice of communicating findings through peer-reviewed journal\\npublications.
      Why do scientists communicate in this way? As I see it,\\nscientific journals
      provide three important services to the community:\\n\\n1.  Journals help scientists
      communicate; they disseminate scientific\\n    results to a broad audience,
      both within one's community and to a\\n    broader scientific audience.\\n\\n2.
      \ Through the peer review process, journals ensure scientific\\n    correctness
      and keep standards high. You never know which of your\\n    scientific adversaries
      might be scrutinizing your work for flaws, so\\n    you're incentivized to do
      the best job possible.\\n\\n3.  Journals, and peer review, help scientists to
      read high-quality,\\n    impactful work by filtering out low-impact papers (even
      those which\\n    are scientifically correct). This makes journals a somewhat
      \\\"fair\\\"\\n    way to score the importance of publications without being
      a\\n    subject-matter expert; I might not know what's happening these days\\n
      \   with topological quantum materials, but if I see three\\n    *Science*/*Nature*
      papers on a CV, I'll certainly pay attention!\\n\\n(There are certainly other
      services that journals provide, like DOIs and\\ntypesetting, but these seem
      much less important to me.)\\n\\nIn this post, I want to (1) discuss the problems
      with scientific\\njournals today, (2) briefly summarize the history of journals
      and\\nexplain how they came to be the way they are today, and (3) imagine how\\njournals
      might evolve in the coming decades to adapt to the changing\\nlandscape of science.
      My central claim is that the scientific journal,\\nas defined by the above criteria,
      has only existed since about the\\n1970s, and will probably not exist for very
      much longer---and that's ok.\\n(I'll also try and explain the esoteric meme
      at the top.)\\n\\n## **1. Journals Present** {#journals-present}\\n\\nMany people
      are upset about scientific journals today, and for many\\ndifferent reasons.\\n\\n###
      **1.1 Profits and Paywalls** {#profits-and-paywalls}\\n\\nThe business model
      of scientific journals is, to put it lightly,\\nunusual. [Writing\\nfor](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\\n*[The\\nGuardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)*,\\nStephen
      Buranyi describes how \\\"scientific publishers manage to duck most\\nof the
      actual costs\\\" that normal magazines incur by outsourcing their\\neditorial
      duties to scientists: the very people who both write and read\\nthe articles:\\n\\n>
      It is as if the New Yorker or the Economist demanded that journalists\\n> write
      and edit each other's work for free, and asked the government to\\n> foot the
      bill. Outside observers tend to fall into a sort of stunned\\n> disbelief when
      describing this setup. A 2004 parliamentary science and\\n> technology committee
      report on the industry drily observed that \\\"in a\\n> traditional market suppliers
      are paid for the goods they provide\\\". A\\n> 2005 Deutsche Bank report referred
      to it as a \\\"bizarre\\\" \\\"triple-pay\\\"\\n> system, in which \\\"the state
      funds most research, pays the salaries of\\n> most of those checking the quality
      of research, and then buys most of\\n> the published product\\\".\\n\\nAnd this
      cost-dodging is very successful: scientific journals are a huge\\nmoneymaker,
      with Elsevier (one of the largest publishers) having a\\nmargin [in excess of\\n30%](https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing),\\nand
      ACS's \\\"information services\\\" (publication) division close behind,\\n[with
      a profit margin of\\n27%](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/aboutacs/financial/2022-audited-financial-statements.pdf).\\n\\nThe
      exorbitant fees charged by journals, and the concomitantly huge\\nprofits they
      earn, have led to increasing pushback against the\\npaywall-based status quo.
      The Biden administration [has\\ncalled](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1)
      for all\\ngovernment-funded research to be free-to-read without any embargo
      by\\n2025, and other countries have been pursuing similar policies [for some\\ntime](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/eu-and-uk-bitten-by-the-open-access-bug/5236.article).\\nSimilarly,\\n[MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611)\\nand
      [the UC\\nsystem](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-uc-split-publishing-giant-elsevier)\\nrecently
      terminated their subscriptions to Elsevier over open-access\\nissues. (And the
      rise of SciHub means that, even without a subscription,\\nmost scientists can
      still read almost any article they\\nwant---threatening to completely destroy
      the closed-access model.)\\n\\nIn response to this pressure, journals have begun
      offering open-access\\nalternatives, where the journal's fees are paid by the
      submitting author\\nrather than the reader. While in theory this is a solution
      to this\\nproblem, in practice the fees for authors are so high that it's not
      a\\nvery good solution. The board of editors of NeuroImage [recently\\nresigned](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
      over their\\njournal's high open-access fees---and they're [not the\\nfirst](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00135-8)
      board of\\neditors to do this. As [a\\n2019](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\\n*[Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)*\\n[summary](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\\nput
      it: \\\"Publishers are still going to get paid. Open access just means\\nthe
      paychecks come at the front end.\\\"\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55789217-2429-4805-abed-2f1e0e783bc4_1176x462.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      {#preprint-servers}\\n\\nThe rise of preprint servers like arXiv, BioRxiv, and
      ChemRxiv also\\nmeans journals aren't necessary for communication of scientific
      results.\\nMore and more, preprints dominate discussions of cutting-edge science,\\nwhile
      actual peer-reviewed publications lag months to years behind.\\n\\nWhile in
      theory preprints aren't supposed to be viewed as scientifically\\nauthoritative---since
      they haven't been reviewed---in practice most\\npreprints are qualitatively
      identical to the peer-reviewed papers that\\nthey give rise to. [A retrospective\\nanalysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285)\\nof
      early COVID preprints found that the vast majority of preprints\\nsurvived peer
      review without any substantive changes to their\\nconclusions (although this
      might be biased by the fact that the worst\\npre-prints will never be accepted
      at all.)\\n\\nIf this is the case, why bother with journals at all? To a growing\\ndegree
      this seems to be the norm in CS and CS-adjacent fields: the\\nlandmark Google
      transformer paper from 2017, [\\\"Attention Is All You\\nNeed,\\\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
      is still just a PDF on\\narXiv six years later, despite being potentially the
      most impactful\\ndiscovery of the 2010s. Similarly, UMAP, [which I discussed
      last\\nweek,](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230417_dimensionality_reduction.html)\\nis
      also just [hanging out on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426),\\nno peer-reviewed
      publication in sight. Still, in chemistry and other\\nsciences we're expected
      to publish in \\\"real journals\\\" if we want to\\ngraduate or get jobs.\\n\\n###
      **1.4 Impact-Neutral Reviewing** {#impact-neutral-reviewing}\\n\\nAn implicit
      assumption of the scientific journal is that high-impact\\npublications can
      be distinguished from low-impact publications without\\nthe benefit of hindsight.
      Yet many of the most impactful scientific\\ndiscoveries---like the Krebs cycle,
      the weak interaction, lasers,\\ncontinental drift, and CRISPR---[were\\nrejected](https://nintil.com/discoveries-ignored)
      when first submitted\\nto journals. How is this possible?\\n\\nI'd argue that
      peer review creates a bias towards incrementalism. It's\\neasy to see how an
      improvement over something already known is\\nsignificant; it's perhaps harder
      to appreciate the impact of a\\nfield-defining discovery, or to believe that
      such a result could even be\\npossible. To quote Antonio Garcia Martinez on
      startups: \\\"If your idea is\\nany good, it won't get stolen, you'll have to
      jam it down people's\\nthroats instead.\\\" True zero-to-one thinking can provoke
      a strong\\nreaction from the establishment, and rarely a positive one.\\n\\n(It's
      worth noting that some of the highest profile organic chemistry\\npapers from
      2022 were new takes on old, established, reactions:\\n[Parasram](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.2c05648)
      and\\n[Leonori's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05211-0)\\n\\\"ozonolysis
      without ozone\\\" and\\n[Nagib's](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo6443)
      \\\"carbenes\\nwithout diazoalkanes.\\\" I love both papers---but I also think
      it's easier\\nfor audiences to appreciate why \\\"ozonolysis without ozone\\\"
      is a big deal\\nthan to process an entirely new idea.)\\n\\nEven for more quotidian
      scientific results, the value of impact-based\\npeer review is limited. Matt
      Clancy at *[New Things Under the\\nSun](https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/nc5341ua/release/3)*\\nwrites
      that, for preprints, paper acceptance is indeed correlated with\\nnumber of
      eventual citations, but that the correlation is weak:\\nreviewers seem to be
      doing better than random chance, but worse than we\\nmight hope. (Similar results
      emerge when studying the efficacy of peer\\nreview for grants.) On the aggregate,
      it does seem true that the average\\n*JACS* paper is better than the average
      *JOC* paper, but the trend is\\nfar from monotonic.\\n\\nThese concerns aren't
      just mine; indeed, a growing number of scientists\\nseek to reject impact-based
      refereeing altogether. The [\\\"impact-neutral\\nreviewing\\\"](http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/2016/01/writing-impact-neutral-review.html?m=1&s=03)\\nmovement
      thinks that papers should be evaluated only on the basis of\\ntheir scientific
      correctness, not their perceived potential impact.\\nAlthough I wouldn't say
      this is a mainstream idea, journals like *[PLOS\\nOne](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information)*,\\n*[Frontiers](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/)*,
      and\\n*[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research)*\\nhave
      adopted versions of it, and perhaps more journals will follow in\\nthe years
      to come.\\n\\nTaken together, these anecdotes demonstrate that all three pillars
      of\\nthe modern scientific journal---communication, peer review, and\\nimpact-based
      sorting---are threatened today.\\n\\n## **2. Journals Past** {#journals-past}\\n\\nHow
      did we get here?\\n\\nThe importance of journals as a filter for low-quality
      work is a modern\\nphenomenon. Of course, editors have always had discretion
      over what to\\npublish, but until fairly recently [the total volume of papers
      was much\\nlower](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490),\\nmeaning
      that it wasn't so vital to separate the wheat from the chaff. In\\nfact, [Stephen\\nBuranyi](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\\nattributes
      the modern obsession with impact factor and prestige to the\\nfounding of *Cell*
      in 1974:\\n\\n> \\\\[*Cell*\\\\] was edited by a young biologist named Ben Lewin,
      who\\n> approached his work with an intense, almost literary bent. Lewin\\n>
      prized long, rigorous papers that answered big questions -- often\\n> representing
      years of research that would have yielded multiple papers\\n> in other venues
      -- and, breaking with the idea that journals were\\n> passive instruments to
      communicate science, he rejected far more\\n> papers than he published....  \\n>
      \  \\n> Suddenly, where you published became immensely important. Other\\n>
      editors took a similarly activist approach in the hopes of replicating\\n> *Cell*'s
      success. Publishers also adopted a metric called \\\"impact\\n> factor,\\\"
      invented in the 1960s by Eugene Garfield, a librarian and\\n> linguist, as a
      rough calculation of how often papers in a given\\n> journal are cited in other
      papers. For publishers, it became a way to\\n> rank and advertise the scientific
      reach of their products. The\\n> new-look journals, with their emphasis on big
      results, shot to the top\\n> of these new rankings, and scientists who published
      in \\\"high-impact\\\"\\n> journals were rewarded with jobs and funding. Almost
      overnight, a new\\n> currency of prestige had been created in the scientific
      world.\\n\\nAs Buranyi reports, the changes induced by *Cell* rippled across
      the\\njournal ecosystem. The acceptance rate at *Nature* [dropped from 35% to\\n13%](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)\\nover
      the following decade-and-a-half (coincidentally also the years when\\npeer review
      was introduced), making journal editors the \\\"kingmakers of\\nscience\\\"
      (Buranyi).\\n\\nPeer review is also a modern addition. In *[Physics\\nToday](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3463)*,\\nMelissa
      Baldwin recounts how peer review only became ubiquitous\\nfollowing a series
      of contentious House subcommittee hearings in 1974\\nthat questioned the value
      of NSF-funded science:\\n\\n> Spending on both basic and applied research had
      increased dramatically\\n> in the 1950s and 1960s---but when doubts began to
      creep in about the\\n> public value of the work that money had funded, scientists
      were faced\\n> with the prospect of losing both public trust and access to research\\n>
      funding. Legislators wanted publicly funded science to be accountable;\\n> scientists
      wanted decisions about science to be left in expert hands.\\n> Trusting peer
      review to ensure that only the best and most essential\\n> science received
      funding seemed a way to split the difference.\\n\\nOur expectation that journals
      ought to validate the correctness of the\\nwork they publish, too, is quite
      modern. Baldwin again:\\n\\n> It also seems significant that refereeing procedures
      were not\\n> initially developed to detect fraud or to ensure the accuracy of\\n>
      scientific claims.... Authors, not referees, were responsible for the\\n> contents
      of their papers. It was not until the 20th century that\\n> anyone thought a
      referee should be responsible for the quality of the\\n> scientific literature,
      and not until the Cold War that something had\\n> to be peer-reviewed to be
      seen as scientifically legitimate.\\n\\nIf journals didn't do peer review and
      they didn't do (as much)\\nimpact-based filtering before the 1970s, what *did*
      they do? The answer\\nis simple: communication. Scientists started communicating
      in journals\\nbecause writing books was too slow, and it was important that
      they be\\nable to share results and get feedback on their ideas quickly. This
      was\\na founding aim of *Nature*:\\n\\n> ...to aid Scientific men themselves,
      by giving early information of\\n> all advances made in any branch of Natural
      knowledge throughout the\\n> world, and by affording them an opportunity of
      discussing the various\\n> Scientific questions which arise from time to time.\\n\\nAlthough
      perhaps underwhelming to a modern audience, this makes sense.\\nScientists back
      in the day didn't have preprints, Twitter, or Zoom---so\\nthey published journal
      articles because it was \\\"one of the fastest ways\\nto bring a scientific
      issue or idea to their fellow researchers'\\nattention\\\"\\n([ref](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)),\\nnot
      because it would look good on their CV. Journals became \\\"the place\\nto discuss
      big science questions\\\" among researchers, and frequently\\nfeatured acrimonious
      and public disputes between researchers---far from\\ncelebrated storehouses
      of truth, journals were simply the social media\\nof pre-communication age scientists.\\n\\n##
      **3. Journals' Future?** {#journals-future}\\n\\nSo, is the solution \\\"reject
      modernity, embrace tradition\\\"? Should we go\\nback to the way things used
      to be and stop worrying about whether\\npublished articles are correct or impactful?\\n\\nAnyone
      who's close to the scientific publishing process knows that this\\nwould be
      ridiculous and suicidal. We've come a long way from the\\nintimate scientific
      community of 18th-century England, where scientists\\nhad reputations to uphold
      and weren't incentivized to crank out a bunch\\nof *Tet. Lett.* papers. Like
      it or not, today's scientists have been\\ntrained to think of their own productivity
      in terms of publications, and\\nthe editorial standards we have today are just
      barely keeping a sea of\\nlow-quality crap at bay (cf. [Goodhart's\\nLaw](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490)).\\nSometimes
      it feels like peer reviewers are the only people who are\\nwilling to give me
      honest criticism about my work---if we get rid of\\nthem, what then?\\n\\nWe
      can understand the changes in journals by borrowing some thinking\\nfrom economics:
      as the scale of communities increases, the norms and\\ninstitutions of the community
      must progress from informal to formal.\\nThis process [has been documented\\nnicely](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/development-of-property-rights-on-frontiers-endowments-norms-and-politics/23F4D5DB23AE6EC415ADF049F6CD0B54)\\nfor
      the development of property rights on frontiers: at first, land is\\nabundant,
      and no property rights are necessary. Later on, inhabitants\\ndevelop a *de
      facto* system of informal property rights to mediate\\ndisputes---and still
      later, these *de facto* property rights are\\ntransformed into *de jure* property
      rights, raising them to the status\\nof law. Communities with 10,000 people
      need more formal institutions\\nthan communities with 100 people.\\n\\nIf we
      revisit the history of scientific journals, we can see an\\nanalogous process
      taking place. Centuries ago there were relatively few\\nscientists, and so journals
      could simply serve as a bulletin board for\\nwhatever these scientists were
      up to. As the scale and scope of science\\nexpanded in the late 20th century,
      peer review became a way to deal with\\nthe rising number of scientific publications,
      sorting the good from the\\nbad and providing feedback. Today, as the scale
      of science continues to\\nincrease and the communication revolution renders
      many of the historical\\nfunctions of journals moot, it seems that journals
      will have to change\\nagain, to adapt to the new needs of the community.\\n\\nTo
      the extent that this post has a key prediction, it's this: scientific\\njournals
      are going to change a lot in the decade or two to come. If\\nyou're a scientist
      today---even a relatively venerable one---you've\\nlived your whole career in
      the post-peer review era, and so I think\\npeople have gotten used to the status
      quo. Submitting papers to\\njournals, getting referee reviews, etc are part
      of what we're taught\\n\\\"being a scientist\\\" means. But this hasn't always
      been true, and it may\\nnot be true within your lifetime!\\n\\nSadly, I don't
      really have a specific high-confidence prediction for how\\njournals will change,
      or how they should change. Instead, I want to\\nsketch out nine little vignettes
      of what could happen to journals, good\\nor bad. These options are neither mutually
      exclusive nor collectively\\nexhaustive; it's meant simply as an exercise in
      creativity, and to\\nprovide a little basis set with which to imagine the future.\\n\\nI'll
      repost the initial image of the post here, for ambiance, and then\\nwalk through
      the possibilities.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d6953d-9702-4717-b086-e7116c0e8ef8_1152x1210.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      Journal as Bastion of Verified Truth** {#the-journal-as-bastion-of-verified-truth}\\n\\nOne
      scenario is that journals, no longer being needed to distribute\\nresults widely,
      will double down on their role as defenders of\\nscientific correctness. To
      a much greater degree, journals will focus on\\nonly publishing truly correct
      work, and thus make peer review their key\\n\\\"value add.\\\" This is already
      being done post-replication crisis in some\\nfields; Michael Nielsen and Kanjun
      Qiu describe the rise of \\\"Registered\\nReports\\\" in their [essay on\\nmetascience](https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/):\\n\\n>
      The idea \\\\[behind Registered Reports\\\\] is for scientists to design\\n>
      their study in advance: exactly what data is to be taken, exactly what\\n> analyses
      are to be run, what questions asked. That study design is\\n> then pre-registered
      publicly, and before data is taken the design is\\n> refereed at the journal.
      The referees can\\\\'t know whether the results\\n> are \\\\\\\"interesting\\\\\\\",
      since no data has yet been taken. There are (as\\n> yet) no results! Rather,
      they\\\\'re looking to see if the design is\\n> sound, and if the questions
      being asked are interesting -- which is\\n> quite different to whether the answers
      are interesting! If the paper\\n> passes this round of peer review, only then
      are the experiments done,\\n> and the paper completed.\\n\\nThis makes more
      sense for medicine or psychology than it does for more\\nexploratory sciences---if
      you're blundering around synthesizing novel\\nlow-valent Bi complexes, it's
      tough to know what you'll find or what\\nexperiments you'll want to run! But
      there are other ways we could make\\nscience more rigorous, if we wanted to.\\n\\nA
      start would be requiring original datafiles (e.g. for NMR spectra)\\ninstead
      of just providing a PDF with images, and having reviewers\\nexamine these data.
      ACS has made some moves in this direction\\n([e.g.](https://publish.acs.org/publish/data_policy)),
      although to my\\nknowledge no ACS journal yet requires original data. One could
      also\\nimagine requiring all figures to be linked to the underlying data, with\\ncode
      supplied by the submitting group (like a Jupyter notebook). A more\\ndrastic
      step would be to require all results to be independently\\nreproduced by another
      research group,\\n[like](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx) *[Organic\\nSyntheses](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx)*\\n[does](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx).\\n\\nThese
      efforts would certainly make the scientific literature more\\naccurate, but
      at what cost? Preparing publications already consumes an\\nexcessive amount
      of time and energy, and making peer review stricter\\nmight just exacerbate
      this problem. Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy\\ndiscuss this in a nice\\n[perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206685/)
      on\\nperverse incentives in modern science:\\n\\n> Assuming that the goal of
      the scientific enterprise is to maximize\\n> true scientific progress, a process
      that overemphasizes quality might\\n> require triple or quadruple blinded studies,
      mandatory replication of\\n> results by independent parties, and peer-review
      of all data and\\n> statistics before publication---such a system would minimize
      mistakes,\\n> but would produce very few results due to overcaution.\\n\\nIt
      seems good that there are some \\\"overcautious\\\" journals, like *Org.\\nSyn.*,
      but it also seems unlikely that all of science will adopt this\\nmodel. In fact,
      a move in this direction might create a two-tiered\\nsystem: some journals would
      adopt stringent policies, but there's a huge\\nincentive for some journals to
      defect and avoid these policies, since\\nauthors are lazy and would prefer not
      to do extra work. It seems\\nunlikely that all of science could realistically
      be moved to a \\\"bastion\\nof truth\\\" model in the near future, although
      perhaps we could push the\\nneedle in that direction.\\n\\n### **3.2 The Journal
      as Guild-Approved Periodical** {#the-journal-as-guild-approved-periodical}\\n\\nIf
      peer review is so vital, why not make it a real career? Imagine a\\nworld in
      which journals like *Nature* and *Science* have their own\\nin-house experts,
      recruited to serve as professional overseers and\\ncustodians of science. Instead
      of your manuscript getting sent to some\\nrandom editor, and thence to whomever
      deigns to respond to that editor's\\nrequest for reviewers, your manuscript
      would be scrutinized by a team of\\nhand-picked domain specialists. This would
      certainly cost money, but\\njournals seem to have a bit of extra cash to spare.\\n\\nI
      call this scenario the \\\"guild-approved periodical\\\" because the\\nprofessionals
      who determined which papers got published would\\nessentially be managers, or
      leaders, of science---they would have a good\\namount of power over other scientists,
      to a degree that seems uncommon\\ntoday. Thus, this model would amount to a
      centralization of science: if\\n*Nature* says you have to do genomics a certain
      way, you have to do it\\nthat way or *Nature* journals won't publish your work!
      I'm not sure\\nwhether this would be good or bad.\\n\\n(It is a little funny
      that the editors of high-tier journals---arguably\\nthe most powerful people
      in their field---are chosen without the\\nknowledge or consent of the field,
      through processes that are completely\\nopaque to rank-and-file scientists.
      To the extent that this proposal\\nallows scientists to choose their own governance,
      it might be good.)\\n\\n### **3.3 The Journal as Living Knowledge Aggregator**
      {#the-journal-as-living-knowledge-aggregator}\\n\\nThis scenario envisions a
      world in which \\\"publications\\\" are freed from\\nthe tyranny of needing
      to be complete at a certain point. While that was\\ntrue in the days when you
      actually got a published physical issue in the\\nmail, it's not necessary in
      the Internet age! Instead, one can imagine a\\ndynamic process of publishing,
      where a journal article is continually\\nupdated in response to new data.\\n\\nA
      2020 article in\\n*[FACETS](https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0012)*\\nproposes
      exactly this model:\\n\\n> The paper of the future may be a digital-only document
      that is not\\n> only discussed openly after the peer-review process but also
      regularly\\n> updated with time-stamped versions and complementary research
      by\\n> different authors... Living systematic reviews are another valuable\\n>
      way to keep research up to date in rapidly evolving fields. The papers\\n> of
      the future that take the form of living reviews can help our\\n> understanding
      of a topic keep pace with the research but will also add\\n> complexities. *(citations
      removed from passage)*\\n\\nThe idea of the living systematic review is being
      tried out by the\\n*[Living Journal of Computational Molecular\\nScience](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031)*,\\nwhich
      (among other things) has published a 60-page [review of enhanced\\nsampling
      methods in\\nMD](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031),\\nwhich
      will continue being updated as the field evolves.\\n\\nThese ideas are cool,
      but I wonder what would happen if more research\\nbecame \\\"living.\\\" Disputes
      and acrimony are part of the collective\\nprocess of scientific truth-seeking.
      What will happen if bitter rivals\\nstart working on the same \\\"living\\\"
      publications---who will adjudicate\\ntheir disputes?\\n\\nWikipedia manages
      to solve this problem through a plethora of editors,\\nwho can even lock down
      particularly controversial pages, and perhaps\\neditors of living journals will
      assume analogous roles. But the ability\\nof our collective scientific intelligence
      to simultaneously believe\\ncontradictory ideas seems like a virtue, not a vice,
      and I worry that\\nliving journals will squash this.\\n\\nAn even thornier question
      is who adjudicates questions of impact. The\\nenhanced sampling review linked
      above has over 400 references, making it\\na formidable tome for a non-expert
      like myself. There's a lot of merit\\nin a non-comprehensive and opinionated
      introduction to the field, which\\ntakes some subjective editorial liberties,
      but it's not clear to me how\\nthat would work in a collaborative living journal.
      What's to stop me\\nfrom linking to my own papers everywhere?\\n\\n(I'm sure
      that there are clever organizational and administrative\\nsolutions to these
      problems; I just don't know what they are.)\\n\\n### **3.4 The Journal as Curated
      Scientific Vision** {#the-journal-as-curated-scientific-vision}\\n\\nIf \\\"objective
      impact\\\" is so hard to determine fairly, why not just\\naccept that we're
      basically just subjectively scoring publications based\\non how much we like
      them, and abandon the pretense of objectivity? One\\ncan imagine the rise of
      a new kind of figure: the editor with authorial\\nlicense, who has a specific
      vision for what they think science should\\nlook like and publishes work in
      keeping with that vision. The role is as\\nmuch aesthetic as it is analytic.\\n\\nThere's
      some historical precedent for this idea---Eric Gilliam's written\\nabout how
      Warren Weaver, a grant director for the Rockefeller\\nFoundation, essentially
      [created the field of molecular\\nbiology](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/a-report-on-scientific-branch-creation)\\n*ex
      nihilo* by following an opinionated thesis about what work ought to\\nbe funded.
      Likewise, one can envision starting a journal as an act of\\ncommunity-building,
      essentially creating a Schelling point for\\nlike-minded scientists to collaborate,
      share results, and develop a\\ncommon approach to science.\\n\\nWe can see hints
      of this today: newsletters like [\\\"Some Items of\\nInterest to Process\\nChemists\\\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.3c00060)
      or Elliot\\nHershberg's *[Century of Bio](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)*\\n[Substack](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)
      highlight a\\nparticular vision of science, although they haven't quite advanced
      to\\nthe stage of formally publishing papers themselves. But perhaps it will\\nhappen
      soon; new movements, like molecular editing or digital chemistry,\\nmight benefit
      from forming more tightly-knit communities.\\n\\n### **3.5 The Journal as Post
      Hoc Impact Archive** {#the-journal-as-post-hoc-impact-archive}\\n\\nIf preprints
      take over every field of science as thoroughly as they have\\ncomputer science,
      journals may find themselves almost completely\\ndivorced from the day-to-day
      practice of science, for better or for\\nworse. Papers might still be submitted
      to journals, and the status of\\nthe journal might still mean something, but
      it wouldn't be a guess\\nanymore---journals could simply accept the advances
      already proven to be\\nimpactful and basically just publish a nicely formatted
      \\\"version of\\nrecord,\\\" like a scientific Library of Congress.\\n\\nThis
      is essentially equivalent to the \\\"publish first, curate second\\\"\\nproposal
      of [Stern and\\nO'Shea](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116)---preprints\\neliminate
      the need for journals to move quickly, so we can just see what\\nwork the community
      finds to be best and collect that into journals. The\\nvalue of journals for
      specialists, who already need to be reading a\\nlarge fraction of the papers
      in their area, would be much\\nlower---journals would mainly be summarizing
      a field's achievements for\\nthose out-of-field. In this scenario, \\\"many
      specialized journals that\\ncurrently curate a large fraction of the literature
      will become\\nobsolete.\\\"\\n\\n(This already happens sometimes; I remember
      chuckling at the 2020 Numpy\\n*Nature* [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2).\\nNumpy
      isn't successful because it was published in *Nature*; Numpy got\\ninto *Nature*
      because it was already successful.)\\n\\n### **3.6 The Journal as Antediluvian
      Status Symbol** {#the-journal-as-antediluvian-status-symbol}\\n\\nPessimistically,
      one can imagine a world in which journal publications\\nstill carry weight with
      the \\\"old guard\\\" and certain sentimental types,\\nbut the scientific community
      has almost completely moved to preprints\\nfor day-to-day communication. In
      this scenario, one might still have to\\npublish journal articles to get a job,
      but it's just a formality, like a\\ndissertation: the active work of science
      is done through preprints. Like\\nBlockbuster, journals might limp along for
      some time, but their fate is\\npretty much sealed.\\n\\n### **3.7 The Journal
      as Philanthropic Pravda** {#the-journal-as-philanthropic-pravda}\\n\\nAnother
      reason why journals might persist in a world driven by preprints\\nis the desire
      of philanthropic agencies to appear beneficent. If a\\ncertain organization,
      public or private, is giving tens of millions of\\ndollars to support scientific
      progress, the only real reward it can reap\\nin the short term is the prestige
      of having its name associated with a\\ngiven discovery. Why not go one step
      further and control the means of\\npublication?\\n\\nIn this *Infinite Jest*-like
      vision, funding a certain project buys you\\nthe right to publish its results
      in your own journal. We can imagine *J.\\nPfizer-Funded Research* and *J. Navy
      Research* competing to fund and\\npublish the most exciting work in a given
      area, since no one wants to\\nsponsor a loser. (Why stop there? Why not name
      things after corporate\\nsponsors? We could have the Red Bull--Higgs Boson,
      or the\\nWittig--Genentech olefination.)\\n\\nAs discussed at the beginning
      of this article, the government \\\"funds\\nmost research, pays the salaries
      of most of those checking the quality\\nof research, and then buys most of the
      published product.\\\" There's a\\ncertain simplicity in a funding agency just
      taking over the whole\\nprocess, but I doubt this would be good for scientists.
      Unifying the\\nroles of funder, publisher, and editor would probably lower the
      agency\\nof actual researchers to an untenably low level.\\n\\n### **3.8 The
      Journal as Rent-Seeking Data Troll** {#the-journal-as-rent-seeking-data-troll}\\n\\nAnother
      depressing scenario is one in which journals cease contributing\\nto the positive
      progress of science, and start essentially just trying\\nto monetize their existing
      intellectual property. As ML and AI become\\nmore important, legal ownership
      of data rights will presumably increase\\nin economic value, and one can easily
      imagine the Elseviers of the world\\nvacuuming up any smaller journals they
      can and then charging exorbitant\\nfees for access to their data. (Goodbye,
      Reaxys...)\\n\\nI hope this doesn't happen.\\n\\n### **3.9 No Journals; Just
      an Anarchic Preprint Lake** {#no-journals-just-an-anarchic-preprint-lake}\\n\\nThe
      obvious alternative to these increasingly far-fetched scenarios is\\nalso the
      simplest; we get rid of journals all together, and---just like\\nin the 1700s---rely
      solely on communication-style preprints on arXiv,\\nbioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc.
      This has been termed a \\\"preprint lake,\\\" in\\nanalogy to [\\\"data lakes.\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake)\\n\\nTo
      help scientists make sense of the lake, one can envision some sort of\\npreprint
      aggregator: a Reddit or Hacker News for science, which sorts\\npapers by audience
      feedback and permits\\n[PubPeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubPeer)-type
      public comments on\\nthe merits and shortcomings of each publication. The home
      page of\\nReddit-for-papers could serve as the equivalent to *Science*; the\\nchemistry-specific
      subpage, the equivalent to *JACS*. Peer review could\\nhappen in a decentralized
      fashion, and reviews would be public for all\\nto see.\\n\\nThere's an anarchic
      appeal to this proposal, but it has potential\\ndrawbacks too:\\n\\n1.  For
      those not immersed in a given field, it's very difficult to know\\n    what's
      good research and what isn't. This is doubly true for\\n    non-scientists---what
      will become of high-school students trying to\\n    write papers?\\n\\n2.  Existing
      status symbols will become more important absent journal\\n    status. To quote
      [Luis Pedro\\n    Coelho](https://luispedro.substack.com/p/against-publication-lakes-glam-journals?s=03):\\n\\n>
      I mostly read preprints by people whose names I already recognize.\\n> When
      thousands of papers are thrown into the \\\"level playing field\\\" of\\n> biorxiv,
      pre-existing markers of prestige end up taking an even\\n> greater role.\\n\\n1.
      \ This presumably will disadvantage up-and-coming scientists, or\\n    scientists
      without access to existing networks of prestige. That\\n    being said, one
      might make the same arguments for the Internet, and\\n    the real effect seems
      to have been exactly the opposite! So I'm not\\n    quite sure how to think
      about this.\\n\\n2.  What \\\"goes viral\\\" may not always be what's the best
      science. Rarely\\n    do thoughtful or contemplative ideas rise to popularity
      out of the\\n    unstructured morass of the Internet, and I find it na\xEFve
      to expect\\n    that scientists would be any different here. That being said,
      the\\n    wisdom of crowds might be the lesser of two evils, given that our\\n
      \   current system is basically \\\"ask three random rivals in the field.\\\"\\n\\n3.
      \ There are also just so many papers out there today that it might\\n    just
      become overwhelming, even to specialists. I miss papers in \\\"my\\n    areas\\\"
      constantly, and I try pretty hard to keep up with the\\n    literature! (Some
      have proposed that [AI might help us sift through\\n    things](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1514),\\n
      \   but AI might also help people write more papers faster---tough to\\n    say
      who will win.)\\n\\n4.  Without the implicit threat of peer review, standards
      might ebb\\n    across the board. I think this is a real concern, but it's possible\\n
      \   that the same community norms enforced through today's peer review\\n    might
      also be enforced through whatever decentralized review process\\n    replaces
      it. [There's some\\n    evidence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-013-9420-1)\\n
      \   that, in knowledge industries with high information asymmetry (like\\n    science),
      communities tend to spontaneously develop strong systems\\n    of self-regulation.\\n\\n##
      **4. Conclusion: Archipelagic Multiverse** {#conclusion-archipelagic-multiverse}\\n\\nThe
      most likely scenario, to me, is that all of this sorta happens\\nsimultaneously.
      Most cutting-edge scientific discussion will move to the\\nanarchic world of
      preprints, but there will still be plenty of room for\\nmore traditional journals:
      some journals will have very high standards\\nand represent the [magisterium
      of scientific\\nauthority](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/),\\nwhile
      other journals will act as living repositories of knowledge and\\nstill others
      will become subjectively curated editorial statements.\\n\\nWe can see journals
      moving in different directions even today: some\\njournals are indicating that
      they'll start requiring original data and\\nimplement more aggressive fraud
      detection, while others are moving away\\nfrom impact-based reviewing. And I
      can't help but notice that it seems\\nto be increasingly acceptable to cite
      preprints in publications,\\nsuggesting that the needle might be moving towards
      the \\\"anarchic\\npreprint lake\\\" scenario ever so slightly.\\n\\nFor my
      part, I plan to continue writing and submitting papers as\\nnecessary, reviewing
      papers when asked, and so forth---but I'm excited\\nfor the future, and to see
      how the new world order compares to the old.\\n\\n*Thanks to Melanie Blackburn,
      Jonathan Wong, Joe Gair, and my wife for\\nhelpful discussions, and Ari Wagen,
      Taylor Wagen, and Eugene Kwan for\\nreading drafts of this piece.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"117635334\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      of the most distinctive parts of science, relative to other fields,\\nis the
      practice of communicating findings through peer-reviewed journal\\npublications.
      Why do scientists communicate in this way? As I see it,\\nscientific journals
      provide three important services to the community:\\n\\n1.  Journals help scientists
      communicate; they disseminate scientific\\n    results to a broad audience,
      both within one's community and to a\\n    broader scientific audience.\\n\\n2.
      \ Through the peer review process, journals ensure scientific\\n    correctness
      and keep standards high. You never know which of your\\n    scientific adversaries
      might be scrutinizing your work for flaws, so\\n    you're incentivized to do
      the best job possible.\\n\\n3.  Journals, and peer review, help scientists to
      read high-quality,\\n    impactful work by filtering out low-impact papers (even
      those which\\n    are scientifically correct). This makes journals a somewhat
      \\\"fair\\\"\\n    way to score the importance of publications without being
      a\\n    subject-matter expert; I might not know what's happening these days\\n
      \   with topological quantum materials, but if I see three\\n    *Science*/*Nature*
      papers on a CV, I'll certainly pay attention!\\n\\n(There are certainly other
      services that journals provide, like DOIs and\\ntypesetting, but these seem
      much less important to me.)\\n\\nIn this post, I want to (1) discuss the problems
      with scientific\\njournals today, (2) briefly summarize the history of journals
      and\\nexplain how they came to be the way they are today, and (3) imagine how\\njournals
      might evolve in the coming decades to adapt to the changing\\nlandscape of science.
      My central claim is that the scientific journal,\\nas defined by the above criteria,
      has only existed since about the\\n1970s, and will probably not exist for very
      much longer---and that's ok.\\n(I'll also try and explain the esoteric meme
      at the top.)\\n\\n## **1. Journals Present** {#journals-present}\\n\\nMany people
      are upset about scientific journals today, and for many\\ndifferent reasons.\\n\\n###
      **1.1 Profits and Paywalls** {#profits-and-paywalls}\\n\\nThe business model
      of scientific journals is, to put it lightly,\\nunusual. [Writing\\nfor](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\\n*[The\\nGuardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)*,\\nStephen
      Buranyi describes how \\\"scientific publishers manage to duck most\\nof the
      actual costs\\\" that normal magazines incur by outsourcing their\\neditorial
      duties to scientists: the very people who both write and read\\nthe articles:\\n\\n>
      It is as if the New Yorker or the Economist demanded that journalists\\n> write
      and edit each other's work for free, and asked the government to\\n> foot the
      bill. Outside observers tend to fall into a sort of stunned\\n> disbelief when
      describing this setup. A 2004 parliamentary science and\\n> technology committee
      report on the industry drily observed that \\\"in a\\n> traditional market suppliers
      are paid for the goods they provide\\\". A\\n> 2005 Deutsche Bank report referred
      to it as a \\\"bizarre\\\" \\\"triple-pay\\\"\\n> system, in which \\\"the state
      funds most research, pays the salaries of\\n> most of those checking the quality
      of research, and then buys most of\\n> the published product\\\".\\n\\nAnd this
      cost-dodging is very successful: scientific journals are a huge\\nmoneymaker,
      with Elsevier (one of the largest publishers) having a\\nmargin [in excess of\\n30%](https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing),\\nand
      ACS's \\\"information services\\\" (publication) division close behind,\\n[with
      a profit margin of\\n27%](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/aboutacs/financial/2022-audited-financial-statements.pdf).\\n\\nThe
      exorbitant fees charged by journals, and the concomitantly huge\\nprofits they
      earn, have led to increasing pushback against the\\npaywall-based status quo.
      The Biden administration [has\\ncalled](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1)
      for all\\ngovernment-funded research to be free-to-read without any embargo
      by\\n2025, and other countries have been pursuing similar policies [for some\\ntime](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/eu-and-uk-bitten-by-the-open-access-bug/5236.article).\\nSimilarly,\\n[MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611)\\nand
      [the UC\\nsystem](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-uc-split-publishing-giant-elsevier)\\nrecently
      terminated their subscriptions to Elsevier over open-access\\nissues. (And the
      rise of SciHub means that, even without a subscription,\\nmost scientists can
      still read almost any article they\\nwant---threatening to completely destroy
      the closed-access model.)\\n\\nIn response to this pressure, journals have begun
      offering open-access\\nalternatives, where the journal's fees are paid by the
      submitting author\\nrather than the reader. While in theory this is a solution
      to this\\nproblem, in practice the fees for authors are so high that it's not
      a\\nvery good solution. The board of editors of NeuroImage [recently\\nresigned](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01391-5)
      over their\\njournal's high open-access fees---and they're [not the\\nfirst](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00135-8)
      board of\\neditors to do this. As [a\\n2019](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\\n*[Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)*\\n[summary](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls)\\nput
      it: \\\"Publishers are still going to get paid. Open access just means\\nthe
      paychecks come at the front end.\\\"\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55789217-2429-4805-abed-2f1e0e783bc4_1176x462.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      has led to\\ngrowing skepticism about the value of peer review. In his article

      Mastroianni describes how experiments to measure its value have\\nyielded dismal

      the reviewers catch. Reviewers are pretty awful at this. In [this\\n> study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019606449870006X?casa_token=D5MklJnYP0MAAAAA:CzyYl8VLg-M-bvKIHxl7vWCIh8AVrkTUizQ9LZPZWh_eVT5jLf3WJlGaJQzYCsHMraF5Fh8mqw)\\n>
      reviewers caught 30% of the major flaws, in [this\\n> study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/187748)\\n>
      they caught 25%, and in [this\\n> study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1258/jrsm.2008.080062)\\n>
      they caught 29%. These were critical issues, like \\\"the paper claims to\\n>
      be a randomized controlled trial but it isn't\\\" and \\\"when you look at\\n>
      the graphs, it's pretty clear there's no effect\\\" and \\\"the authors draw\\n>
      conclusions that are totally unsupported by the data.\\\" Reviewers\\n> mostly
      didn't notice.\\n\\nWhile the worst of the replication crisis seems to be contained
      to the\\nsocial sciences, my own field---chemistry---is by no means exempt.

      {#preprint-servers}\\n\\nThe rise of preprint servers like arXiv, BioRxiv, and
      ChemRxiv also\\nmeans journals aren't necessary for communication of scientific
      results.\\nMore and more, preprints dominate discussions of cutting-edge science,\\nwhile
      actual peer-reviewed publications lag months to years behind.\\n\\nWhile in
      theory preprints aren't supposed to be viewed as scientifically\\nauthoritative---since
      they haven't been reviewed---in practice most\\npreprints are qualitatively
      identical to the peer-reviewed papers that\\nthey give rise to. [A retrospective\\nanalysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285)\\nof
      early COVID preprints found that the vast majority of preprints\\nsurvived peer
      review without any substantive changes to their\\nconclusions (although this
      might be biased by the fact that the worst\\npre-prints will never be accepted
      at all.)\\n\\nIf this is the case, why bother with journals at all? To a growing\\ndegree
      this seems to be the norm in CS and CS-adjacent fields: the\\nlandmark Google
      transformer paper from 2017, [\\\"Attention Is All You\\nNeed,\\\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
      is still just a PDF on\\narXiv six years later, despite being potentially the
      most impactful\\ndiscovery of the 2010s. Similarly, UMAP, [which I discussed
      last\\nweek,](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230417_dimensionality_reduction.html)\\nis
      also just [hanging out on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426),\\nno peer-reviewed
      publication in sight. Still, in chemistry and other\\nsciences we're expected
      to publish in \\\"real journals\\\" if we want to\\ngraduate or get jobs.\\n\\n###
      **1.4 Impact-Neutral Reviewing** {#impact-neutral-reviewing}\\n\\nAn implicit
      assumption of the scientific journal is that high-impact\\npublications can
      be distinguished from low-impact publications without\\nthe benefit of hindsight.
      Yet many of the most impactful scientific\\ndiscoveries---like the Krebs cycle,
      the weak interaction, lasers,\\ncontinental drift, and CRISPR---[were\\nrejected](https://nintil.com/discoveries-ignored)
      when first submitted\\nto journals. How is this possible?\\n\\nI'd argue that
      peer review creates a bias towards incrementalism. It's\\neasy to see how an
      improvement over something already known is\\nsignificant; it's perhaps harder
      to appreciate the impact of a\\nfield-defining discovery, or to believe that
      such a result could even be\\npossible. To quote Antonio Garcia Martinez on
      startups: \\\"If your idea is\\nany good, it won't get stolen, you'll have to
      jam it down people's\\nthroats instead.\\\" True zero-to-one thinking can provoke
      a strong\\nreaction from the establishment, and rarely a positive one.\\n\\n(It's
      worth noting that some of the highest profile organic chemistry\\npapers from
      2022 were new takes on old, established, reactions:\\n[Parasram](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.2c05648)
      and\\n[Leonori's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05211-0)\\n\\\"ozonolysis
      without ozone\\\" and\\n[Nagib's](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo6443)
      \\\"carbenes\\nwithout diazoalkanes.\\\" I love both papers---but I also think
      it's easier\\nfor audiences to appreciate why \\\"ozonolysis without ozone\\\"
      is a big deal\\nthan to process an entirely new idea.)\\n\\nEven for more quotidian
      scientific results, the value of impact-based\\npeer review is limited. Matt
      Clancy at *[New Things Under the\\nSun](https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/nc5341ua/release/3)*\\nwrites
      that, for preprints, paper acceptance is indeed correlated with\\nnumber of
      eventual citations, but that the correlation is weak:\\nreviewers seem to be
      doing better than random chance, but worse than we\\nmight hope. (Similar results
      emerge when studying the efficacy of peer\\nreview for grants.) On the aggregate,
      it does seem true that the average\\n*JACS* paper is better than the average
      *JOC* paper, but the trend is\\nfar from monotonic.\\n\\nThese concerns aren't
      just mine; indeed, a growing number of scientists\\nseek to reject impact-based
      refereeing altogether. The [\\\"impact-neutral\\nreviewing\\\"](http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.com/2016/01/writing-impact-neutral-review.html?m=1&s=03)\\nmovement
      thinks that papers should be evaluated only on the basis of\\ntheir scientific
      correctness, not their perceived potential impact.\\nAlthough I wouldn't say
      this is a mainstream idea, journals like *[PLOS\\nOne](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information)*,\\n*[Frontiers](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/)*,
      and\\n*[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research)*\\nhave
      adopted versions of it, and perhaps more journals will follow in\\nthe years
      to come.\\n\\nTaken together, these anecdotes demonstrate that all three pillars
      of\\nthe modern scientific journal---communication, peer review, and\\nimpact-based
      sorting---are threatened today.\\n\\n## **2. Journals Past** {#journals-past}\\n\\nHow
      did we get here?\\n\\nThe importance of journals as a filter for low-quality
      work is a modern\\nphenomenon. Of course, editors have always had discretion
      over what to\\npublish, but until fairly recently [the total volume of papers
      was much\\nlower](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490),\\nmeaning
      that it wasn't so vital to separate the wheat from the chaff. In\\nfact, [Stephen\\nBuranyi](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)\\nattributes
      the modern obsession with impact factor and prestige to the\\nfounding of *Cell*
      in 1974:\\n\\n> \\\\[*Cell*\\\\] was edited by a young biologist named Ben Lewin,
      who\\n> approached his work with an intense, almost literary bent. Lewin\\n>
      prized long, rigorous papers that answered big questions -- often\\n> representing
      years of research that would have yielded multiple papers\\n> in other venues
      -- and, breaking with the idea that journals were\\n> passive instruments to
      communicate science, he rejected far more\\n> papers than he published....  \\n>
      \  \\n> Suddenly, where you published became immensely important. Other\\n>
      editors took a similarly activist approach in the hopes of replicating\\n> *Cell*'s
      success. Publishers also adopted a metric called \\\"impact\\n> factor,\\\"
      invented in the 1960s by Eugene Garfield, a librarian and\\n> linguist, as a
      rough calculation of how often papers in a given\\n> journal are cited in other
      papers. For publishers, it became a way to\\n> rank and advertise the scientific
      reach of their products. The\\n> new-look journals, with their emphasis on big
      results, shot to the top\\n> of these new rankings, and scientists who published
      in \\\"high-impact\\\"\\n> journals were rewarded with jobs and funding. Almost
      overnight, a new\\n> currency of prestige had been created in the scientific
      world.\\n\\nAs Buranyi reports, the changes induced by *Cell* rippled across
      the\\njournal ecosystem. The acceptance rate at *Nature* [dropped from 35% to\\n13%](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)\\nover
      the following decade-and-a-half (coincidentally also the years when\\npeer review
      was introduced), making journal editors the \\\"kingmakers of\\nscience\\\"
      (Buranyi).\\n\\nPeer review is also a modern addition. In *[Physics\\nToday](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3463)*,\\nMelissa
      Baldwin recounts how peer review only became ubiquitous\\nfollowing a series
      of contentious House subcommittee hearings in 1974\\nthat questioned the value
      of NSF-funded science:\\n\\n> Spending on both basic and applied research had
      increased dramatically\\n> in the 1950s and 1960s---but when doubts began to
      creep in about the\\n> public value of the work that money had funded, scientists
      were faced\\n> with the prospect of losing both public trust and access to research\\n>
      funding. Legislators wanted publicly funded science to be accountable;\\n> scientists
      wanted decisions about science to be left in expert hands.\\n> Trusting peer
      review to ensure that only the best and most essential\\n> science received
      funding seemed a way to split the difference.\\n\\nOur expectation that journals
      ought to validate the correctness of the\\nwork they publish, too, is quite
      modern. Baldwin again:\\n\\n> It also seems significant that refereeing procedures
      were not\\n> initially developed to detect fraud or to ensure the accuracy of\\n>
      scientific claims.... Authors, not referees, were responsible for the\\n> contents
      of their papers. It was not until the 20th century that\\n> anyone thought a
      referee should be responsible for the quality of the\\n> scientific literature,
      and not until the Cold War that something had\\n> to be peer-reviewed to be
      seen as scientifically legitimate.\\n\\nIf journals didn't do peer review and
      they didn't do (as much)\\nimpact-based filtering before the 1970s, what *did*
      they do? The answer\\nis simple: communication. Scientists started communicating
      in journals\\nbecause writing books was too slow, and it was important that
      they be\\nable to share results and get feedback on their ideas quickly. This
      was\\na founding aim of *Nature*:\\n\\n> ...to aid Scientific men themselves,
      by giving early information of\\n> all advances made in any branch of Natural
      knowledge throughout the\\n> world, and by affording them an opportunity of
      discussing the various\\n> Scientific questions which arise from time to time.\\n\\nAlthough
      perhaps underwhelming to a modern audience, this makes sense.\\nScientists back
      in the day didn't have preprints, Twitter, or Zoom---so\\nthey published journal
      articles because it was \\\"one of the fastest ways\\nto bring a scientific
      issue or idea to their fellow researchers'\\nattention\\\"\\n([ref](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)),\\nnot
      because it would look good on their CV. Journals became \\\"the place\\nto discuss
      big science questions\\\" among researchers, and frequently\\nfeatured acrimonious
      and public disputes between researchers---far from\\ncelebrated storehouses
      of truth, journals were simply the social media\\nof pre-communication age scientists.\\n\\n##
      **3. Journals' Future?** {#journals-future}\\n\\nSo, is the solution \\\"reject
      modernity, embrace tradition\\\"? Should we go\\nback to the way things used
      to be and stop worrying about whether\\npublished articles are correct or impactful?\\n\\nAnyone
      who's close to the scientific publishing process knows that this\\nwould be
      ridiculous and suicidal. We've come a long way from the\\nintimate scientific
      community of 18th-century England, where scientists\\nhad reputations to uphold
      and weren't incentivized to crank out a bunch\\nof *Tet. Lett.* papers. Like
      it or not, today's scientists have been\\ntrained to think of their own productivity
      in terms of publications, and\\nthe editorial standards we have today are just
      barely keeping a sea of\\nlow-quality crap at bay (cf. [Goodhart's\\nLaw](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490)).\\nSometimes
      it feels like peer reviewers are the only people who are\\nwilling to give me
      honest criticism about my work---if we get rid of\\nthem, what then?\\n\\nWe
      can understand the changes in journals by borrowing some thinking\\nfrom economics:
      as the scale of communities increases, the norms and\\ninstitutions of the community
      must progress from informal to formal.\\nThis process [has been documented\\nnicely](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/development-of-property-rights-on-frontiers-endowments-norms-and-politics/23F4D5DB23AE6EC415ADF049F6CD0B54)\\nfor
      the development of property rights on frontiers: at first, land is\\nabundant,
      and no property rights are necessary. Later on, inhabitants\\ndevelop a *de
      facto* system of informal property rights to mediate\\ndisputes---and still
      later, these *de facto* property rights are\\ntransformed into *de jure* property
      rights, raising them to the status\\nof law. Communities with 10,000 people
      need more formal institutions\\nthan communities with 100 people.\\n\\nIf we
      revisit the history of scientific journals, we can see an\\nanalogous process
      taking place. Centuries ago there were relatively few\\nscientists, and so journals
      could simply serve as a bulletin board for\\nwhatever these scientists were
      up to. As the scale and scope of science\\nexpanded in the late 20th century,
      peer review became a way to deal with\\nthe rising number of scientific publications,
      sorting the good from the\\nbad and providing feedback. Today, as the scale
      of science continues to\\nincrease and the communication revolution renders
      many of the historical\\nfunctions of journals moot, it seems that journals
      will have to change\\nagain, to adapt to the new needs of the community.\\n\\nTo
      the extent that this post has a key prediction, it's this: scientific\\njournals
      are going to change a lot in the decade or two to come. If\\nyou're a scientist
      today---even a relatively venerable one---you've\\nlived your whole career in
      the post-peer review era, and so I think\\npeople have gotten used to the status
      quo. Submitting papers to\\njournals, getting referee reviews, etc are part
      of what we're taught\\n\\\"being a scientist\\\" means. But this hasn't always
      been true, and it may\\nnot be true within your lifetime!\\n\\nSadly, I don't
      really have a specific high-confidence prediction for how\\njournals will change,
      or how they should change. Instead, I want to\\nsketch out nine little vignettes
      of what could happen to journals, good\\nor bad. These options are neither mutually
      exclusive nor collectively\\nexhaustive; it's meant simply as an exercise in
      creativity, and to\\nprovide a little basis set with which to imagine the future.\\n\\nI'll
      repost the initial image of the post here, for ambiance, and then\\nwalk through
      the possibilities.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d6953d-9702-4717-b086-e7116c0e8ef8_1152x1210.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      Journal as Bastion of Verified Truth** {#the-journal-as-bastion-of-verified-truth}\\n\\nOne
      scenario is that journals, no longer being needed to distribute\\nresults widely,
      will double down on their role as defenders of\\nscientific correctness. To
      a much greater degree, journals will focus on\\nonly publishing truly correct
      work, and thus make peer review their key\\n\\\"value add.\\\" This is already
      being done post-replication crisis in some\\nfields; Michael Nielsen and Kanjun
      Qiu describe the rise of \\\"Registered\\nReports\\\" in their [essay on\\nmetascience](https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/):\\n\\n>
      The idea \\\\[behind Registered Reports\\\\] is for scientists to design\\n>
      their study in advance: exactly what data is to be taken, exactly what\\n> analyses
      are to be run, what questions asked. That study design is\\n> then pre-registered
      publicly, and before data is taken the design is\\n> refereed at the journal.
      The referees can\\\\'t know whether the results\\n> are \\\\\\\"interesting\\\\\\\",
      since no data has yet been taken. There are (as\\n> yet) no results! Rather,
      they\\\\'re looking to see if the design is\\n> sound, and if the questions
      being asked are interesting -- which is\\n> quite different to whether the answers
      are interesting! If the paper\\n> passes this round of peer review, only then
      are the experiments done,\\n> and the paper completed.\\n\\nThis makes more
      sense for medicine or psychology than it does for more\\nexploratory sciences---if
      you're blundering around synthesizing novel\\nlow-valent Bi complexes, it's
      tough to know what you'll find or what\\nexperiments you'll want to run! But
      there are other ways we could make\\nscience more rigorous, if we wanted to.\\n\\nA
      start would be requiring original datafiles (e.g. for NMR spectra)\\ninstead
      of just providing a PDF with images, and having reviewers\\nexamine these data.
      ACS has made some moves in this direction\\n([e.g.](https://publish.acs.org/publish/data_policy)),
      although to my\\nknowledge no ACS journal yet requires original data. One could
      also\\nimagine requiring all figures to be linked to the underlying data, with\\ncode
      supplied by the submitting group (like a Jupyter notebook). A more\\ndrastic
      step would be to require all results to be independently\\nreproduced by another
      research group,\\n[like](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx) *[Organic\\nSyntheses](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx)*\\n[does](http://www.orgsyn.org/about.aspx).\\n\\nThese
      efforts would certainly make the scientific literature more\\naccurate, but
      at what cost? Preparing publications already consumes an\\nexcessive amount
      of time and energy, and making peer review stricter\\nmight just exacerbate
      this problem. Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy\\ndiscuss this in a nice\\n[perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206685/)
      on\\nperverse incentives in modern science:\\n\\n> Assuming that the goal of
      the scientific enterprise is to maximize\\n> true scientific progress, a process
      that overemphasizes quality might\\n> require triple or quadruple blinded studies,
      mandatory replication of\\n> results by independent parties, and peer-review
      of all data and\\n> statistics before publication---such a system would minimize
      mistakes,\\n> but would produce very few results due to overcaution.\\n\\nIt
      seems good that there are some \\\"overcautious\\\" journals, like *Org.\\nSyn.*,
      but it also seems unlikely that all of science will adopt this\\nmodel. In fact,
      a move in this direction might create a two-tiered\\nsystem: some journals would
      adopt stringent policies, but there's a huge\\nincentive for some journals to
      defect and avoid these policies, since\\nauthors are lazy and would prefer not
      to do extra work. It seems\\nunlikely that all of science could realistically
      be moved to a \\\"bastion\\nof truth\\\" model in the near future, although
      perhaps we could push the\\nneedle in that direction.\\n\\n### **3.2 The Journal
      as Guild-Approved Periodical** {#the-journal-as-guild-approved-periodical}\\n\\nIf
      peer review is so vital, why not make it a real career? Imagine a\\nworld in
      which journals like *Nature* and *Science* have their own\\nin-house experts,
      recruited to serve as professional overseers and\\ncustodians of science. Instead
      of your manuscript getting sent to some\\nrandom editor, and thence to whomever
      deigns to respond to that editor's\\nrequest for reviewers, your manuscript
      would be scrutinized by a team of\\nhand-picked domain specialists. This would
      certainly cost money, but\\njournals seem to have a bit of extra cash to spare.\\n\\nI
      call this scenario the \\\"guild-approved periodical\\\" because the\\nprofessionals
      who determined which papers got published would\\nessentially be managers, or
      leaders, of science---they would have a good\\namount of power over other scientists,
      to a degree that seems uncommon\\ntoday. Thus, this model would amount to a
      centralization of science: if\\n*Nature* says you have to do genomics a certain
      way, you have to do it\\nthat way or *Nature* journals won't publish your work!
      I'm not sure\\nwhether this would be good or bad.\\n\\n(It is a little funny
      that the editors of high-tier journals---arguably\\nthe most powerful people
      in their field---are chosen without the\\nknowledge or consent of the field,
      through processes that are completely\\nopaque to rank-and-file scientists.
      To the extent that this proposal\\nallows scientists to choose their own governance,
      it might be good.)\\n\\n### **3.3 The Journal as Living Knowledge Aggregator**
      {#the-journal-as-living-knowledge-aggregator}\\n\\nThis scenario envisions a
      world in which \\\"publications\\\" are freed from\\nthe tyranny of needing
      to be complete at a certain point. While that was\\ntrue in the days when you
      actually got a published physical issue in the\\nmail, it's not necessary in
      the Internet age! Instead, one can imagine a\\ndynamic process of publishing,
      where a journal article is continually\\nupdated in response to new data.\\n\\nA
      2020 article in\\n*[FACETS](https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0012)*\\nproposes
      exactly this model:\\n\\n> The paper of the future may be a digital-only document
      that is not\\n> only discussed openly after the peer-review process but also
      regularly\\n> updated with time-stamped versions and complementary research
      by\\n> different authors... Living systematic reviews are another valuable\\n>
      way to keep research up to date in rapidly evolving fields. The papers\\n> of
      the future that take the form of living reviews can help our\\n> understanding
      of a topic keep pace with the research but will also add\\n> complexities. *(citations
      removed from passage)*\\n\\nThe idea of the living systematic review is being
      tried out by the\\n*[Living Journal of Computational Molecular\\nScience](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031)*,\\nwhich
      (among other things) has published a 60-page [review of enhanced\\nsampling
      methods in\\nMD](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v1i1e2031),\\nwhich
      will continue being updated as the field evolves.\\n\\nThese ideas are cool,
      but I wonder what would happen if more research\\nbecame \\\"living.\\\" Disputes
      and acrimony are part of the collective\\nprocess of scientific truth-seeking.
      What will happen if bitter rivals\\nstart working on the same \\\"living\\\"
      publications---who will adjudicate\\ntheir disputes?\\n\\nWikipedia manages
      to solve this problem through a plethora of editors,\\nwho can even lock down
      particularly controversial pages, and perhaps\\neditors of living journals will
      assume analogous roles. But the ability\\nof our collective scientific intelligence
      to simultaneously believe\\ncontradictory ideas seems like a virtue, not a vice,
      and I worry that\\nliving journals will squash this.\\n\\nAn even thornier question
      is who adjudicates questions of impact. The\\nenhanced sampling review linked
      above has over 400 references, making it\\na formidable tome for a non-expert
      like myself. There's a lot of merit\\nin a non-comprehensive and opinionated
      introduction to the field, which\\ntakes some subjective editorial liberties,
      but it's not clear to me how\\nthat would work in a collaborative living journal.
      What's to stop me\\nfrom linking to my own papers everywhere?\\n\\n(I'm sure
      that there are clever organizational and administrative\\nsolutions to these
      problems; I just don't know what they are.)\\n\\n### **3.4 The Journal as Curated
      Scientific Vision** {#the-journal-as-curated-scientific-vision}\\n\\nIf \\\"objective
      impact\\\" is so hard to determine fairly, why not just\\naccept that we're
      basically just subjectively scoring publications based\\non how much we like
      them, and abandon the pretense of objectivity? One\\ncan imagine the rise of
      a new kind of figure: the editor with authorial\\nlicense, who has a specific
      vision for what they think science should\\nlook like and publishes work in
      keeping with that vision. The role is as\\nmuch aesthetic as it is analytic.\\n\\nThere's
      some historical precedent for this idea---Eric Gilliam's written\\nabout how
      Warren Weaver, a grant director for the Rockefeller\\nFoundation, essentially
      [created the field of molecular\\nbiology](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/a-report-on-scientific-branch-creation)\\n*ex
      nihilo* by following an opinionated thesis about what work ought to\\nbe funded.
      Likewise, one can envision starting a journal as an act of\\ncommunity-building,
      essentially creating a Schelling point for\\nlike-minded scientists to collaborate,
      share results, and develop a\\ncommon approach to science.\\n\\nWe can see hints
      of this today: newsletters like [\\\"Some Items of\\nInterest to Process\\nChemists\\\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.oprd.3c00060)
      or Elliot\\nHershberg's *[Century of Bio](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)*\\n[Substack](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/about)
      highlight a\\nparticular vision of science, although they haven't quite advanced
      to\\nthe stage of formally publishing papers themselves. But perhaps it will\\nhappen
      soon; new movements, like molecular editing or digital chemistry,\\nmight benefit
      from forming more tightly-knit communities.\\n\\n### **3.5 The Journal as Post
      Hoc Impact Archive** {#the-journal-as-post-hoc-impact-archive}\\n\\nIf preprints
      take over every field of science as thoroughly as they have\\ncomputer science,
      journals may find themselves almost completely\\ndivorced from the day-to-day
      practice of science, for better or for\\nworse. Papers might still be submitted
      to journals, and the status of\\nthe journal might still mean something, but
      it wouldn't be a guess\\nanymore---journals could simply accept the advances
      already proven to be\\nimpactful and basically just publish a nicely formatted
      \\\"version of\\nrecord,\\\" like a scientific Library of Congress.\\n\\nThis
      is essentially equivalent to the \\\"publish first, curate second\\\"\\nproposal
      of [Stern and\\nO'Shea](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000116)---preprints\\neliminate
      the need for journals to move quickly, so we can just see what\\nwork the community
      finds to be best and collect that into journals. The\\nvalue of journals for
      specialists, who already need to be reading a\\nlarge fraction of the papers
      in their area, would be much\\nlower---journals would mainly be summarizing
      a field's achievements for\\nthose out-of-field. In this scenario, \\\"many
      specialized journals that\\ncurrently curate a large fraction of the literature
      will become\\nobsolete.\\\"\\n\\n(This already happens sometimes; I remember
      chuckling at the 2020 Numpy\\n*Nature* [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2).\\nNumpy
      isn't successful because it was published in *Nature*; Numpy got\\ninto *Nature*
      because it was already successful.)\\n\\n### **3.6 The Journal as Antediluvian
      Status Symbol** {#the-journal-as-antediluvian-status-symbol}\\n\\nPessimistically,
      one can imagine a world in which journal publications\\nstill carry weight with
      the \\\"old guard\\\" and certain sentimental types,\\nbut the scientific community
      has almost completely moved to preprints\\nfor day-to-day communication. In
      this scenario, one might still have to\\npublish journal articles to get a job,
      but it's just a formality, like a\\ndissertation: the active work of science
      is done through preprints. Like\\nBlockbuster, journals might limp along for
      some time, but their fate is\\npretty much sealed.\\n\\n### **3.7 The Journal
      as Philanthropic Pravda** {#the-journal-as-philanthropic-pravda}\\n\\nAnother
      reason why journals might persist in a world driven by preprints\\nis the desire
      of philanthropic agencies to appear beneficent. If a\\ncertain organization,
      public or private, is giving tens of millions of\\ndollars to support scientific
      progress, the only real reward it can reap\\nin the short term is the prestige
      of having its name associated with a\\ngiven discovery. Why not go one step
      further and control the means of\\npublication?\\n\\nIn this *Infinite Jest*-like
      vision, funding a certain project buys you\\nthe right to publish its results
      in your own journal. We can imagine *J.\\nPfizer-Funded Research* and *J. Navy
      Research* competing to fund and\\npublish the most exciting work in a given
      area, since no one wants to\\nsponsor a loser. (Why stop there? Why not name
      things after corporate\\nsponsors? We could have the Red Bull--Higgs Boson,
      or the\\nWittig--Genentech olefination.)\\n\\nAs discussed at the beginning
      of this article, the government \\\"funds\\nmost research, pays the salaries
      of most of those checking the quality\\nof research, and then buys most of the
      published product.\\\" There's a\\ncertain simplicity in a funding agency just
      taking over the whole\\nprocess, but I doubt this would be good for scientists.
      Unifying the\\nroles of funder, publisher, and editor would probably lower the
      agency\\nof actual researchers to an untenably low level.\\n\\n### **3.8 The
      Journal as Rent-Seeking Data Troll** {#the-journal-as-rent-seeking-data-troll}\\n\\nAnother
      depressing scenario is one in which journals cease contributing\\nto the positive
      progress of science, and start essentially just trying\\nto monetize their existing
      intellectual property. As ML and AI become\\nmore important, legal ownership
      of data rights will presumably increase\\nin economic value, and one can easily
      imagine the Elseviers of the world\\nvacuuming up any smaller journals they
      can and then charging exorbitant\\nfees for access to their data. (Goodbye,
      Reaxys...)\\n\\nI hope this doesn't happen.\\n\\n### **3.9 No Journals; Just
      an Anarchic Preprint Lake** {#no-journals-just-an-anarchic-preprint-lake}\\n\\nThe
      obvious alternative to these increasingly far-fetched scenarios is\\nalso the
      simplest; we get rid of journals all together, and---just like\\nin the 1700s---rely
      solely on communication-style preprints on arXiv,\\nbioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc.
      This has been termed a \\\"preprint lake,\\\" in\\nanalogy to [\\\"data lakes.\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake)\\n\\nTo
      help scientists make sense of the lake, one can envision some sort of\\npreprint
      aggregator: a Reddit or Hacker News for science, which sorts\\npapers by audience
      feedback and permits\\n[PubPeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubPeer)-type
      public comments on\\nthe merits and shortcomings of each publication. The home
      page of\\nReddit-for-papers could serve as the equivalent to *Science*; the\\nchemistry-specific
      subpage, the equivalent to *JACS*. Peer review could\\nhappen in a decentralized
      fashion, and reviews would be public for all\\nto see.\\n\\nThere's an anarchic
      appeal to this proposal, but it has potential\\ndrawbacks too:\\n\\n1.  For
      those not immersed in a given field, it's very difficult to know\\n    what's
      good research and what isn't. This is doubly true for\\n    non-scientists---what
      will become of high-school students trying to\\n    write papers?\\n\\n2.  Existing
      status symbols will become more important absent journal\\n    status. To quote
      [Luis Pedro\\n    Coelho](https://luispedro.substack.com/p/against-publication-lakes-glam-journals?s=03):\\n\\n>
      I mostly read preprints by people whose names I already recognize.\\n> When
      thousands of papers are thrown into the \\\"level playing field\\\" of\\n> biorxiv,
      pre-existing markers of prestige end up taking an even\\n> greater role.\\n\\n1.
      \ This presumably will disadvantage up-and-coming scientists, or\\n    scientists
      without access to existing networks of prestige. That\\n    being said, one
      might make the same arguments for the Internet, and\\n    the real effect seems
      to have been exactly the opposite! So I'm not\\n    quite sure how to think
      about this.\\n\\n2.  What \\\"goes viral\\\" may not always be what's the best
      science. Rarely\\n    do thoughtful or contemplative ideas rise to popularity
      out of the\\n    unstructured morass of the Internet, and I find it na\xEFve
      to expect\\n    that scientists would be any different here. That being said,
      the\\n    wisdom of crowds might be the lesser of two evils, given that our\\n
      \   current system is basically \\\"ask three random rivals in the field.\\\"\\n\\n3.
      \ There are also just so many papers out there today that it might\\n    just
      become overwhelming, even to specialists. I miss papers in \\\"my\\n    areas\\\"
      constantly, and I try pretty hard to keep up with the\\n    literature! (Some
      have proposed that [AI might help us sift through\\n    things](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1514),\\n
      \   but AI might also help people write more papers faster---tough to\\n    say
      who will win.)\\n\\n4.  Without the implicit threat of peer review, standards
      might ebb\\n    across the board. I think this is a real concern, but it's possible\\n
      \   that the same community norms enforced through today's peer review\\n    might
      also be enforced through whatever decentralized review process\\n    replaces
      it. [There's some\\n    evidence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-013-9420-1)\\n
      \   that, in knowledge industries with high information asymmetry (like\\n    science),
      communities tend to spontaneously develop strong systems\\n    of self-regulation.\\n\\n##
      **4. Conclusion: Archipelagic Multiverse** {#conclusion-archipelagic-multiverse}\\n\\nThe
      most likely scenario, to me, is that all of this sorta happens\\nsimultaneously.
      Most cutting-edge scientific discussion will move to the\\nanarchic world of
      preprints, but there will still be plenty of room for\\nmore traditional journals:
      some journals will have very high standards\\nand represent the [magisterium
      of scientific\\nauthority](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/),\\nwhile
      other journals will act as living repositories of knowledge and\\nstill others
      will become subjectively curated editorial statements.\\n\\nWe can see journals
      moving in different directions even today: some\\njournals are indicating that
      they'll start requiring original data and\\nimplement more aggressive fraud
      detection, while others are moving away\\nfrom impact-based reviewing. And I
      can't help but notice that it seems\\nto be increasingly acceptable to cite
      preprints in publications,\\nsuggesting that the needle might be moving towards
      the \\\"anarchic\\npreprint lake\\\" scenario ever so slightly.\\n\\nFor my
      part, I plan to continue writing and submitting papers as\\nnecessary, reviewing
      papers when asked, and so forth---but I'm excited\\nfor the future, and to see
      how the new world order compares to the old.\\n\\n*Thanks to Melanie Blackburn,

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "In many
      applications, including cheminformatics, it''s common to have\ndatasets that
      have too many dimensions to analyze conveniently. For\ninstance, [chemical\nfingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf)\nare
      typically 2048-length binary vectors, meaning that \"chemical space\"\nas encoded
      by fingerprints is 2048-dimensional.\n\nTo more easily handle these complex
      datasets (and to bypass the [\"curse\nof\ndimensionality\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)),\nit''s
      common practice to use a dimensionality reduction algorithm to\nconvert the
      data to a low-dimensional space. In this post I want to\ncompare and contrast
      three approaches to dimensionality reduction, and\ndiscuss the challenges with
      low-dimensional embeddings in general.\n\n## **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**\n\nThere
      are many approaches to dimensionality reduction, but I''m only\ngoing to talk
      about three here: PCA, tSNE, and UMAP.\n\n[Principal component\nanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\n(PCA)
      is perhaps the most famous dimensionality reduction algorithm, and\nis commonly
      used in a variety of scientific fields. PCA works by\ntransforming the data
      into a new set of coordinates such that the first\ncoordinate vector explains
      the largest amount of the variance, the\nsecond coordinate vector the next most
      variance, and so on and so forth.\nIt''s pretty common for the first 5--20 dimensions
      to capture \\>99% of\nthe variance, meaning that the subsequent dimensions can
      essentially be\ndiscarded wholesale.\n\n[tSNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)\n(t-distributed
      stochastic neighbor embedding) and\n[UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html)\n(uniform
      manifold approximation and projection) are alternative\ndimensionality reduction
      approaches, based on much more complex\nalgorithms. To quote Wikipedia:\n\n>
      The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs\n> a
      probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in\n> such a
      way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability\n> while dissimilar
      points are assigned a lower probability. Second,\n> t-SNE defines a similar
      probability distribution over the points in\n> the low-dimensional map, and
      it minimizes the Kullback--Leibler\n> divergence (KL divergence) between the
      two distributions with respect\n> to the locations of the points in the map.\n\nUMAP,
      at a high level, works in a very similar way, but uses some fancy\ntopology
      to construct a \"fuzzy simplicial complex\" representation of the\ndata in high-dimensional
      space, and then projects this representation\ndown into a lower dimension ([more
      detailed\nexplanation](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/)).\nPractically,
      UMAP is a lot faster than tSNE, and is becoming the\nalgorithm of choice for
      most cheminformatics applications. (Although, in\nfairness, there are [ways
      to make tSNE\nfaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09005).)\n\n## **Data Visualization**\n\nFor
      the purposes of this post, I chose to study Abbie Doyle''s set of\n[2683 aryl
      bromides](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)\n(obtained from Reaxys,
      with various filters applied). I used the RDKIT7\nfingerprint to generate a
      2048-bit encoding of each aryl bromide,\ncomputed a distance matrix using Tanimoto/Jaccard
      distance, and then\nused each dimensionality reduction technique to generate

      chemical space using UMAP (30\nneighbors, 0.1 minimum distance).</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nUMAP
      also creates tight tSNE-like clusters, but UMAP plots generally\nhave a much
      more variable overall shape---the clusters themselves are\ntighter and scattered
      across more space. (These considerations are\ncomplicated by the fact that UMAP
      has multiple tunable hyperparameters,\nmeaning that the exact appearance of
      the plot is substantially up to the\nend user.)\n\nThe debate between tSNE and
      UMAP is spirited\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.877522v1.full.pdf)),\nbut
      for whatever reason people in chemistry almost exclusively use UMAP.\n(See,
      for instance, pretty much every paper I taked about [in this\npost](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230118_meta_optimization.html).)\n\nAn
      important thing that I''m not showing here, but which bears\nmentioning, is
      that the clusters in all three plots are actually\nchemically meaningful. For
      instance, each cluster in the tSNE plot\ngenerally corresponds to a different
      functional group: carboxylic acids,\nalkynes, etc. So the graphs do in some
      real sense correspond to the\nintuition we have about molecular similarity,
      which is good! (You can\nuse [molplotly](https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly)
      to visualize these\nplots very easily.)\n\n## **Distance Preservation**\n\nHow
      well are distances from the high-dimensional space preserved in the\n2D embedding?
      Obviously the distances won''t all be the same, but ideally\nthe mapping would
      be monotonic: if distance A is greater than distance B\nin the high-dimensional
      space, we would like distance A to also be\ngreater than distance B in the low-dimensional
      space.\n\nWe can measure this with [Spearman\ncorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient),\nwhich
      is like a Pearson correlation (AKA \"r-squared\") but without the\nassumption
      of linearity. A Spearman correlation coefficient of 1\nindicates a perfect monotonic
      relationship, while a coefficient of 0\nindicates no relationship. Let''s plot
      the pairwise distances from each\nembedding against the true distances and compare
      the Spearman\ncoefficients:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef25c98a-8bb9-47f4-9a13-eeca5da894ab_594x1392.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      see that the 2048-dimensional space has a very distinct\nhistogram. Most of
      the compounds are pretty different from one another,\nand---crucially---most
      of the distances are about the same (0.8 or so).\nIn chemical terms, this means
      that most of the fingerprints share a few\nepitopes in common, but otherwise
      are substantially different, which is\nunsurprising since fingerprints in general
      are quite sparse.\n\nUnfortunately, \"lots of equidistant points\" is an extremely
      tough\npattern to recapitulate in a low-dimensional space. We can see why with\na
      toy example: in 2D space, we can only have 3 equidistant points (an\nequilateral
      triangle), and in 3D space, we can only have 4 equidistant\npoints (a tetrahedron).
      More generally, if we want *N* equidistant\npoints, we need to be in **R***^N^*^-1^
      (*N*-1 dimensional Euclidean\nspace). We can [relax this\nrequirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma)\na
      little bit if we''re willing to accept approximate equidistance, but\nthe general
      principle still holds: it''s hard to recapitulate lots of\nequidistant points
      in a low-dimensional space.\n\nAs expected, then, we can see that the histogram
      of each of our\nalgorithms looks very different from the ideal distance histogram.\n\n##
      **Local Structure**\n\nBoth tSNE and UMAP take the nearest neighbors of each
      point explicitly\ninto account, and claim to preserve the local structure of
      the points as\nmuch as possible. To put these claims to the test, I looked at
      the\nclosest 30 neighbors of each point in high-dimensional space, and then\nchecked
      how many of those neighbors made it into the closest 30\nneighbors in low-dimensional
      space.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc79a1d9-48ba-4ab0-b96c-26c025c7a36a_794x596.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      recapitulated correctly, as\nneighborhood size increases.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWe
      can see that UMAP and tSNE both preserve about 60% of the neighbors\nacross
      a wide range of neighborhood sizes, while PCA gets better as we\nzoom out more.
      (At the limit where we consider all 2683 points as\nneighbors, every method
      will trivially achieve perfect accuracy.) tSNE\ndoes much better than UMAP for
      small neighborhoods; I''m not sure why!\n\nAnother way to think about this is
      in terms of the [precision--recall\ntradeoff](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html).\nIn
      classification, \"precision\" refers to a classifier''s ability to avoid\nfalse
      positives, while \"recall\" refers to a classifier''s ability to\navoid false
      negatives. What does this mean in the context of embedding?\n\nImagine looking
      at all points in the neighborhood of our central point\nin high-dimensional
      space, and then comparing to the points within a\ncertain radius of our point
      in low-dimensional space. As we increase the\nradius, we expect to see more
      of the correct neighbor points in\nlow-dimensional space, but we also expect
      to see more \"incorrect\nneighbors\" that aren''t really there in the high-dimensional
      space.\n([This paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/venna10a/venna10a.pdf)\ndiscusses
      these issues nicely, as does [this\npresentation](https://coursepages2.tuni.fi/mttts17/wp-content/uploads/sites/136/2020/03/drv_2020_lecture_7.pdf).)\n\nSo
      low radii lead to high precision (most of the points are really\nneighbors)
      but low recall (we''re not finding most of the neighbors),\nwhile high radii
      lead to low precision and high recall. We can thus\nstudy the performance of
      our embedding by graphing the precision--recall\ncurve for various neighborhood
      sizes. The better the embedding, the\ncloser the curve will come to the top
      right:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d615197-eb27-4e29-a2d7-5c27f7a02fd9_793x796.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      to 3, 4, or more dimensions. This would\nmake visualization tricky, but might
      still be suitable for other\noperations (like clustering).\n\ntSNE gets very,
      very slow in higher dimensions, so I focused on PCA and\nUMAP for this study.

      our precision--recall graph is still pretty dismal when compared to\ntSNE or
      UMAP. So, it seems like if distances are what matters, then\nhigh-dimensional
      PCA is an appealing choice---but if local structure is\nwhat matters, tSNE or
      UMAP is still superior.\n\n## **Conclusions**\n\nMy big takeaway from all of
      this is: dimensionality reduction is a lossy\nprocess, and one where you always
      have to make tradeoffs. You''re\nfundamentally throwing away information, and
      that always has a cost:\nthere''s no such thing as a free lunch. As such, if
      you don''t have to\nperform dimensionality reduction, then my inclination would
      be to avoid\nit. (People in single-cell genomics seem to have come to [a similar\nconclusion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v4.full.pdf).)\n\nIf
      you really need your data to be in a low-dimensional space (e.g. for\nplotting),
      then keep in mind what you''re trying to study! PCA seems to\ndo a slightly
      better job with distances (although I''m sure there are\nmore sophisticated
      strategies for distance-preserving dimensionality\nreduction), while tSNE and
      UMAP seem to do much, much better with local\nstructure.\n\n*Thanks to Michael
      Tartre for helpful conversations, and the students in\nCarnegie Mellon''s \"Digital
      Molecular Design Studio\" class for their\nthought-provoking questions on these

      many applications, including cheminformatics, it's common to have\\ndatasets
      that have too many dimensions to analyze conveniently. For\\ninstance, [chemical\\nfingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf)\\nare
      typically 2048-length binary vectors, meaning that \\\"chemical space\\\"\\nas
      encoded by fingerprints is 2048-dimensional.\\n\\nTo more easily handle these
      complex datasets (and to bypass the [\\\"curse\\nof\\ndimensionality\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)),\\nit's
      common practice to use a dimensionality reduction algorithm to\\nconvert the
      data to a low-dimensional space. In this post I want to\\ncompare and contrast
      three approaches to dimensionality reduction, and\\ndiscuss the challenges with
      low-dimensional embeddings in general.\\n\\n## **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**\\n\\nThere
      are many approaches to dimensionality reduction, but I'm only\\ngoing to talk
      about three here: PCA, tSNE, and UMAP.\\n\\n[Principal component\\nanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\\n(PCA)
      is perhaps the most famous dimensionality reduction algorithm, and\\nis commonly
      used in a variety of scientific fields. PCA works by\\ntransforming the data
      into a new set of coordinates such that the first\\ncoordinate vector explains
      the largest amount of the variance, the\\nsecond coordinate vector the next
      most variance, and so on and so forth.\\nIt's pretty common for the first 5--20
      dimensions to capture \\\\>99% of\\nthe variance, meaning that the subsequent
      dimensions can essentially be\\ndiscarded wholesale.\\n\\n[tSNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)\\n(t-distributed
      stochastic neighbor embedding) and\\n[UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html)\\n(uniform
      manifold approximation and projection) are alternative\\ndimensionality reduction
      approaches, based on much more complex\\nalgorithms. To quote Wikipedia:\\n\\n>
      The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs\\n> a
      probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in\\n> such
      a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability\\n> while dissimilar
      points are assigned a lower probability. Second,\\n> t-SNE defines a similar
      probability distribution over the points in\\n> the low-dimensional map, and
      it minimizes the Kullback--Leibler\\n> divergence (KL divergence) between the
      two distributions with respect\\n> to the locations of the points in the map.\\n\\nUMAP,
      at a high level, works in a very similar way, but uses some fancy\\ntopology
      to construct a \\\"fuzzy simplicial complex\\\" representation of the\\ndata
      in high-dimensional space, and then projects this representation\\ndown into
      a lower dimension ([more detailed\\nexplanation](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/)).\\nPractically,
      UMAP is a lot faster than tSNE, and is becoming the\\nalgorithm of choice for
      most cheminformatics applications. (Although, in\\nfairness, there are [ways
      to make tSNE\\nfaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09005).)\\n\\n## **Data Visualization**\\n\\nFor
      the purposes of this post, I chose to study Abbie Doyle's set of\\n[2683 aryl
      bromides](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)\\n(obtained from Reaxys,
      with various filters applied). I used the RDKIT7\\nfingerprint to generate a
      2048-bit encoding of each aryl bromide,\\ncomputed a distance matrix using Tanimoto/Jaccard
      distance, and then\\nused each dimensionality reduction technique to generate
      a 2-dimensional\\nembedding.\\n\\nLet's look at PCA first:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fbb7844-df77-4bc2-8e31-3dc9e25b72b2_794x794.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      bromide chemical space using UMAP (30\\nneighbors, 0.1 minimum distance).</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nUMAP
      also creates tight tSNE-like clusters, but UMAP plots generally\\nhave a much
      more variable overall shape---the clusters themselves are\\ntighter and scattered
      across more space. (These considerations are\\ncomplicated by the fact that
      UMAP has multiple tunable hyperparameters,\\nmeaning that the exact appearance
      of the plot is substantially up to the\\nend user.)\\n\\nThe debate between
      tSNE and UMAP is spirited\\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.877522v1.full.pdf)),\\nbut
      for whatever reason people in chemistry almost exclusively use UMAP.\\n(See,
      for instance, pretty much every paper I taked about [in this\\npost](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230118_meta_optimization.html).)\\n\\nAn
      important thing that I'm not showing here, but which bears\\nmentioning, is
      that the clusters in all three plots are actually\\nchemically meaningful. For
      instance, each cluster in the tSNE plot\\ngenerally corresponds to a different
      functional group: carboxylic acids,\\nalkynes, etc. So the graphs do in some
      real sense correspond to the\\nintuition we have about molecular similarity,
      which is good! (You can\\nuse [molplotly](https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly)
      to visualize these\\nplots very easily.)\\n\\n## **Distance Preservation**\\n\\nHow
      well are distances from the high-dimensional space preserved in the\\n2D embedding?
      Obviously the distances won't all be the same, but ideally\\nthe mapping would
      be monotonic: if distance A is greater than distance B\\nin the high-dimensional
      space, we would like distance A to also be\\ngreater than distance B in the
      low-dimensional space.\\n\\nWe can measure this with [Spearman\\ncorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient),\\nwhich
      is like a Pearson correlation (AKA \\\"r-squared\\\") but without the\\nassumption
      of linearity. A Spearman correlation coefficient of 1\\nindicates a perfect
      monotonic relationship, while a coefficient of 0\\nindicates no relationship.
      Let's plot the pairwise distances from each\\nembedding against the true distances
      and compare the Spearman\\ncoefficients:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef25c98a-8bb9-47f4-9a13-eeca5da894ab_594x1392.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      of the compounds are pretty different from one another,\\nand---crucially---most
      of the distances are about the same (0.8 or so).\\nIn chemical terms, this means
      that most of the fingerprints share a few\\nepitopes in common, but otherwise
      are substantially different, which is\\nunsurprising since fingerprints in general
      are quite sparse.\\n\\nUnfortunately, \\\"lots of equidistant points\\\" is
      an extremely tough\\npattern to recapitulate in a low-dimensional space. We
      can see why with\\na toy example: in 2D space, we can only have 3 equidistant
      points (an\\nequilateral triangle), and in 3D space, we can only have 4 equidistant\\npoints
      (a tetrahedron). More generally, if we want *N* equidistant\\npoints, we need
      to be in **R***^N^*^-1^ (*N*-1 dimensional Euclidean\\nspace). We can [relax
      this\\nrequirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma)\\na
      little bit if we're willing to accept approximate equidistance, but\\nthe general
      principle still holds: it's hard to recapitulate lots of\\nequidistant points
      in a low-dimensional space.\\n\\nAs expected, then, we can see that the histogram
      of each of our\\nalgorithms looks very different from the ideal distance histogram.\\n\\n##
      **Local Structure**\\n\\nBoth tSNE and UMAP take the nearest neighbors of each
      point explicitly\\ninto account, and claim to preserve the local structure of
      the points as\\nmuch as possible. To put these claims to the test, I looked
      at the\\nclosest 30 neighbors of each point in high-dimensional space, and then\\nchecked
      how many of those neighbors made it into the closest 30\\nneighbors in low-dimensional
      space.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc79a1d9-48ba-4ab0-b96c-26c025c7a36a_794x596.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      recapitulated correctly, as\\nneighborhood size increases.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWe
      can see that UMAP and tSNE both preserve about 60% of the neighbors\\nacross
      a wide range of neighborhood sizes, while PCA gets better as we\\nzoom out more.
      (At the limit where we consider all 2683 points as\\nneighbors, every method
      will trivially achieve perfect accuracy.) tSNE\\ndoes much better than UMAP
      for small neighborhoods; I'm not sure why!\\n\\nAnother way to think about this
      is in terms of the [precision--recall\\ntradeoff](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html).\\nIn
      classification, \\\"precision\\\" refers to a classifier's ability to avoid\\nfalse
      positives, while \\\"recall\\\" refers to a classifier's ability to\\navoid
      false negatives. What does this mean in the context of embedding?\\n\\nImagine
      looking at all points in the neighborhood of our central point\\nin high-dimensional
      space, and then comparing to the points within a\\ncertain radius of our point
      in low-dimensional space. As we increase the\\nradius, we expect to see more
      of the correct neighbor points in\\nlow-dimensional space, but we also expect
      to see more \\\"incorrect\\nneighbors\\\" that aren't really there in the high-dimensional
      space.\\n([This paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/venna10a/venna10a.pdf)\\ndiscusses
      these issues nicely, as does [this\\npresentation](https://coursepages2.tuni.fi/mttts17/wp-content/uploads/sites/136/2020/03/drv_2020_lecture_7.pdf).)\\n\\nSo
      low radii lead to high precision (most of the points are really\\nneighbors)
      but low recall (we're not finding most of the neighbors),\\nwhile high radii
      lead to low precision and high recall. We can thus\\nstudy the performance of
      our embedding by graphing the precision--recall\\ncurve for various neighborhood
      sizes. The better the embedding, the\\ncloser the curve will come to the top
      right:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d615197-eb27-4e29-a2d7-5c27f7a02fd9_793x796.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      our precision--recall graph is still pretty dismal when compared to\\ntSNE or
      UMAP. So, it seems like if distances are what matters, then\\nhigh-dimensional
      PCA is an appealing choice---but if local structure is\\nwhat matters, tSNE
      or UMAP is still superior.\\n\\n## **Conclusions**\\n\\nMy big takeaway from
      all of this is: dimensionality reduction is a lossy\\nprocess, and one where
      you always have to make tradeoffs. You're\\nfundamentally throwing away information,
      and that always has a cost:\\nthere's no such thing as a free lunch. As such,
      if you don't have to\\nperform dimensionality reduction, then my inclination
      would be to avoid\\nit. (People in single-cell genomics seem to have come to
      [a similar\\nconclusion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v4.full.pdf).)\\n\\nIf
      you really need your data to be in a low-dimensional space (e.g. for\\nplotting),
      then keep in mind what you're trying to study! PCA seems to\\ndo a slightly
      better job with distances (although I'm sure there are\\nmore sophisticated
      strategies for distance-preserving dimensionality\\nreduction), while tSNE and
      UMAP seem to do much, much better with local\\nstructure.\\n\\n*Thanks to Michael
      Tartre for helpful conversations, and the students in\\nCarnegie Mellon's \\\"Digital

      many applications, including cheminformatics, it's common to have\\ndatasets
      that have too many dimensions to analyze conveniently. For\\ninstance, [chemical\\nfingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf)\\nare
      typically 2048-length binary vectors, meaning that \\\"chemical space\\\"\\nas
      encoded by fingerprints is 2048-dimensional.\\n\\nTo more easily handle these
      complex datasets (and to bypass the [\\\"curse\\nof\\ndimensionality\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)),\\nit's
      common practice to use a dimensionality reduction algorithm to\\nconvert the
      data to a low-dimensional space. In this post I want to\\ncompare and contrast
      three approaches to dimensionality reduction, and\\ndiscuss the challenges with
      low-dimensional embeddings in general.\\n\\n## **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms**\\n\\nThere
      are many approaches to dimensionality reduction, but I'm only\\ngoing to talk
      about three here: PCA, tSNE, and UMAP.\\n\\n[Principal component\\nanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\\n(PCA)
      is perhaps the most famous dimensionality reduction algorithm, and\\nis commonly
      used in a variety of scientific fields. PCA works by\\ntransforming the data
      into a new set of coordinates such that the first\\ncoordinate vector explains
      the largest amount of the variance, the\\nsecond coordinate vector the next
      most variance, and so on and so forth.\\nIt's pretty common for the first 5--20
      dimensions to capture \\\\>99% of\\nthe variance, meaning that the subsequent
      dimensions can essentially be\\ndiscarded wholesale.\\n\\n[tSNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)\\n(t-distributed
      stochastic neighbor embedding) and\\n[UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html)\\n(uniform
      manifold approximation and projection) are alternative\\ndimensionality reduction
      approaches, based on much more complex\\nalgorithms. To quote Wikipedia:\\n\\n>
      The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs\\n> a
      probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in\\n> such
      a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability\\n> while dissimilar
      points are assigned a lower probability. Second,\\n> t-SNE defines a similar
      probability distribution over the points in\\n> the low-dimensional map, and
      it minimizes the Kullback--Leibler\\n> divergence (KL divergence) between the
      two distributions with respect\\n> to the locations of the points in the map.\\n\\nUMAP,
      at a high level, works in a very similar way, but uses some fancy\\ntopology
      to construct a \\\"fuzzy simplicial complex\\\" representation of the\\ndata
      in high-dimensional space, and then projects this representation\\ndown into
      a lower dimension ([more detailed\\nexplanation](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/)).\\nPractically,
      UMAP is a lot faster than tSNE, and is becoming the\\nalgorithm of choice for
      most cheminformatics applications. (Although, in\\nfairness, there are [ways
      to make tSNE\\nfaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09005).)\\n\\n## **Data Visualization**\\n\\nFor
      the purposes of this post, I chose to study Abbie Doyle's set of\\n[2683 aryl
      bromides](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)\\n(obtained from Reaxys,
      with various filters applied). I used the RDKIT7\\nfingerprint to generate a
      2048-bit encoding of each aryl bromide,\\ncomputed a distance matrix using Tanimoto/Jaccard
      distance, and then\\nused each dimensionality reduction technique to generate
      a 2-dimensional\\nembedding.\\n\\nLet's look at PCA first:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fbb7844-df77-4bc2-8e31-3dc9e25b72b2_794x794.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      bromide chemical space using UMAP (30\\nneighbors, 0.1 minimum distance).</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nUMAP
      also creates tight tSNE-like clusters, but UMAP plots generally\\nhave a much
      more variable overall shape---the clusters themselves are\\ntighter and scattered
      across more space. (These considerations are\\ncomplicated by the fact that
      UMAP has multiple tunable hyperparameters,\\nmeaning that the exact appearance
      of the plot is substantially up to the\\nend user.)\\n\\nThe debate between
      tSNE and UMAP is spirited\\n([e.g.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.877522v1.full.pdf)),\\nbut
      for whatever reason people in chemistry almost exclusively use UMAP.\\n(See,
      for instance, pretty much every paper I taked about [in this\\npost](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230118_meta_optimization.html).)\\n\\nAn
      important thing that I'm not showing here, but which bears\\nmentioning, is
      that the clusters in all three plots are actually\\nchemically meaningful. For
      instance, each cluster in the tSNE plot\\ngenerally corresponds to a different
      functional group: carboxylic acids,\\nalkynes, etc. So the graphs do in some
      real sense correspond to the\\nintuition we have about molecular similarity,
      which is good! (You can\\nuse [molplotly](https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly)
      to visualize these\\nplots very easily.)\\n\\n## **Distance Preservation**\\n\\nHow
      well are distances from the high-dimensional space preserved in the\\n2D embedding?
      Obviously the distances won't all be the same, but ideally\\nthe mapping would
      be monotonic: if distance A is greater than distance B\\nin the high-dimensional
      space, we would like distance A to also be\\ngreater than distance B in the
      low-dimensional space.\\n\\nWe can measure this with [Spearman\\ncorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient),\\nwhich
      is like a Pearson correlation (AKA \\\"r-squared\\\") but without the\\nassumption
      of linearity. A Spearman correlation coefficient of 1\\nindicates a perfect
      monotonic relationship, while a coefficient of 0\\nindicates no relationship.
      Let's plot the pairwise distances from each\\nembedding against the true distances
      and compare the Spearman\\ncoefficients:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef25c98a-8bb9-47f4-9a13-eeca5da894ab_594x1392.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      can see that the 2048-dimensional space has a very distinct\\nhistogram. Most
      of the compounds are pretty different from one another,\\nand---crucially---most
      of the distances are about the same (0.8 or so).\\nIn chemical terms, this means
      that most of the fingerprints share a few\\nepitopes in common, but otherwise
      are substantially different, which is\\nunsurprising since fingerprints in general
      are quite sparse.\\n\\nUnfortunately, \\\"lots of equidistant points\\\" is
      an extremely tough\\npattern to recapitulate in a low-dimensional space. We
      can see why with\\na toy example: in 2D space, we can only have 3 equidistant
      points (an\\nequilateral triangle), and in 3D space, we can only have 4 equidistant\\npoints
      (a tetrahedron). More generally, if we want *N* equidistant\\npoints, we need
      to be in **R***^N^*^-1^ (*N*-1 dimensional Euclidean\\nspace). We can [relax
      this\\nrequirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma)\\na
      little bit if we're willing to accept approximate equidistance, but\\nthe general
      principle still holds: it's hard to recapitulate lots of\\nequidistant points
      in a low-dimensional space.\\n\\nAs expected, then, we can see that the histogram
      of each of our\\nalgorithms looks very different from the ideal distance histogram.\\n\\n##
      **Local Structure**\\n\\nBoth tSNE and UMAP take the nearest neighbors of each
      point explicitly\\ninto account, and claim to preserve the local structure of
      the points as\\nmuch as possible. To put these claims to the test, I looked
      at the\\nclosest 30 neighbors of each point in high-dimensional space, and then\\nchecked
      how many of those neighbors made it into the closest 30\\nneighbors in low-dimensional
      space.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc79a1d9-48ba-4ab0-b96c-26c025c7a36a_794x596.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      recapitulated correctly, as\\nneighborhood size increases.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWe
      can see that UMAP and tSNE both preserve about 60% of the neighbors\\nacross
      a wide range of neighborhood sizes, while PCA gets better as we\\nzoom out more.
      (At the limit where we consider all 2683 points as\\nneighbors, every method
      will trivially achieve perfect accuracy.) tSNE\\ndoes much better than UMAP
      for small neighborhoods; I'm not sure why!\\n\\nAnother way to think about this
      is in terms of the [precision--recall\\ntradeoff](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html).\\nIn
      classification, \\\"precision\\\" refers to a classifier's ability to avoid\\nfalse
      positives, while \\\"recall\\\" refers to a classifier's ability to\\navoid
      false negatives. What does this mean in the context of embedding?\\n\\nImagine
      looking at all points in the neighborhood of our central point\\nin high-dimensional
      space, and then comparing to the points within a\\ncertain radius of our point
      in low-dimensional space. As we increase the\\nradius, we expect to see more
      of the correct neighbor points in\\nlow-dimensional space, but we also expect
      to see more \\\"incorrect\\nneighbors\\\" that aren't really there in the high-dimensional
      space.\\n([This paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/venna10a/venna10a.pdf)\\ndiscusses
      these issues nicely, as does [this\\npresentation](https://coursepages2.tuni.fi/mttts17/wp-content/uploads/sites/136/2020/03/drv_2020_lecture_7.pdf).)\\n\\nSo
      low radii lead to high precision (most of the points are really\\nneighbors)
      but low recall (we're not finding most of the neighbors),\\nwhile high radii
      lead to low precision and high recall. We can thus\\nstudy the performance of
      our embedding by graphing the precision--recall\\ncurve for various neighborhood
      sizes. The better the embedding, the\\ncloser the curve will come to the top
      right:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d615197-eb27-4e29-a2d7-5c27f7a02fd9_793x796.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      comparable. In contrast, PCA is just abysmal.\\n\\nThe big conclusion of this
      section is that, if you're doing something\\nthat depends on the local structure
      of the data, you should avoid PCA.\\n\\n## **Do Higher Dimensions Help Things?**\\n\\nSince
      the root of our issues here is trying to represent a\\n2048-dimensional distance
      matrix in 2 dimensions, one might wonder if we\\ncould do better by expanding
      to 3, 4, or more dimensions. This would\\nmake visualization tricky, but might
      still be suitable for other\\noperations (like clustering).\\n\\ntSNE gets very,
      very slow in higher dimensions, so I focused on PCA and\\nUMAP for this study.
      I started out by comparing the Spearman correlation\\nfor PCA and UMAP up to
      20 dimensions:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faadfe822-ef39-47a7-97b4-2187be6f0814_793x796.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      our precision--recall graph is still pretty dismal when compared to\\ntSNE or
      UMAP. So, it seems like if distances are what matters, then\\nhigh-dimensional
      PCA is an appealing choice---but if local structure is\\nwhat matters, tSNE
      or UMAP is still superior.\\n\\n## **Conclusions**\\n\\nMy big takeaway from
      all of this is: dimensionality reduction is a lossy\\nprocess, and one where
      you always have to make tradeoffs. You're\\nfundamentally throwing away information,
      and that always has a cost:\\nthere's no such thing as a free lunch. As such,
      if you don't have to\\nperform dimensionality reduction, then my inclination
      would be to avoid\\nit. (People in single-cell genomics seem to have come to
      [a similar\\nconclusion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v4.full.pdf).)\\n\\nIf
      you really need your data to be in a low-dimensional space (e.g. for\\nplotting),
      then keep in mind what you're trying to study! PCA seems to\\ndo a slightly
      better job with distances (although I'm sure there are\\nmore sophisticated
      strategies for distance-preserving dimensionality\\nreduction), while tSNE and
      UMAP seem to do much, much better with local\\nstructure.\\n\\n*Thanks to Michael
      Tartre for helpful conversations, and the students in\\nCarnegie Mellon's \\\"Digital

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "This Easter
      week, I''ve been thinking about why new ventures are so\nimportant. Whether
      in private industry, where startups are the most\nconsistent source of innovative
      ideas, or in academia, where new\nassistant professors are hired each year,
      newcomers are often the most\nconsistent source of innovation. Why is this?\n\nOne
      explanation is the [Arrow replacement\neffect](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c2144/c2144.pdf)\n(named
      after [Kenneth\nArrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow)), which
      states that\n\"preinvention monopoly power acts as a strong disincentive to
      further\ninnovation.\" Arrow''s argument goes like this: suppose there''s an\norganization
      that is earning profit *P~old~*, and there is some\ninnovation that will increase
      profit to *P~new~* (*P~new~* \\> *P~old~*).\nIf the existing organization pursues
      the innovation, their profits will\nthus increase by *\u2206P* := *P~new~* -
      *P~old~*. But a new organization\nwill see its profits increase by *P~new~*:
      since the startup has no\nexisting profit to replace, the rewards to innovation
      are higher. Thus\ninnovation is more appealing for those without any economic
      stake in the\nstatus quo.[^1^](#fn1)\n\nWe can see this play out today in the
      dynamic between Google and\nOpenAI/Microsoft: Google already has a virtual monopoly
      in search, and\nso is hesitant to replace what they have, whereas Microsoft
      has already\nbeen losing in search and so is eager to replace Bing with ~~Sydney~~
      an\nAI-powered alternative. (It''s to Apple''s credit that they so eagerly\npursued
      the iPhone when it meant effectively destroying the iPod, one of\ntheir top
      money-makers.[^2^](#fn2))\n\nOne can also see this scenario in academia---plenty
      of established labs\nhave programs built up around studying specific systems,
      and are thus\ndisincentivized to study areas which might obviate projects they''ve\nspent
      decades working on. For instance, labs dedicated to \"conventional\"\nsynthetic
      methodology might be slower to turn to biocatalysis than a new\nassistant professor
      with nothing to lose; labs that have spent decades\nstudying protein folding
      might be slower to turn to AlphaFold than they\nought to.\n\nAnother reason
      is that new entrants often have an advantage in\nunderstanding the status quo.
      In *The Art of Doing Science and\nEngineering* (book review coming, eventually),
      computing legend [Richard\nHamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)
      discusses how\nthere''s often a disadvantage to being a pioneer in a field.
      Hamming''s\nargument, essentially, is that those who''ve had to invent something
      new\nnever understand it as intuitively as those who have simply learned to\ntake
      it for granted:\n\n> The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight
      through so\n> many dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding
      and\n> confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is\n>
      open and the path made easy.... in time the same will probably be true\n> of
      you.\n\nIn Hamming''s view, it''s the latecomers to a field who can see more\nclearly
      the new possibilities opened by various innovations, and take\nthe next steps
      towards previously unimaginable frontiers. There''s a deep\nirony in this: the
      very act of inventing something new makes you less\nable to see the innovations
      enabled by your own work. The process of\ninvention thus acts like a relay race,
      where newer generations\ncontinually take the baton and push things forward
      before in turn\ndropping back.\n\nI''ve heard these ideas discussed in terms
      of na\u00efvete before---the idea\nbeing that innovation requires a sort of
      \"beginner''s luck,\" a blind\noptimism about what''s possible that the experienced
      lack---but I think\nthat''s wrong. A belief in na\u00efvete as the key driver
      of innovation\nimplies that excessive knowledge is detrimental: that it''s possible
      to\n\"know too much\" and cripple oneself. If anything, the opposite is true\nin
      my experience. The most creative and productive people I''ve met are\nthose
      with an utter mastery of the knowledge in their domain.\n\nHamming''s proposal,
      which is more cognitive/subconscious, is thus\ncomplementary to the more calculated
      logic of the Arrow replacement\ntheorem: existing organizations are both less
      incentivized to innovate\nand less able to see potential innovations. These
      ideas should be\nencouraging to anyone at the beginning of their career: you
      are uniquely\npoised to discover and exploit new opportunities! So consider
      this an\nexhortation to go out and do so now (rather than waiting until you
      are\nolder and more secure in your field).\n\n*Credit to [Alex\nTabarrok](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/04/the-arrow-replacement-effect-and-the-dynamics-of-us-inventors.html?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-arrow-replacement-effect-and-the-dynamics-of-us-inventors)\nfor

      Easter week, I've been thinking about why new ventures are so\\nimportant. Whether
      in private industry, where startups are the most\\nconsistent source of innovative
      ideas, or in academia, where new\\nassistant professors are hired each year,
      newcomers are often the most\\nconsistent source of innovation. Why is this?\\n\\nOne
      explanation is the [Arrow replacement\\neffect](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c2144/c2144.pdf)\\n(named
      after [Kenneth\\nArrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow)), which
      states that\\n\\\"preinvention monopoly power acts as a strong disincentive
      to further\\ninnovation.\\\" Arrow's argument goes like this: suppose there's
      an\\norganization that is earning profit *P~old~*, and there is some\\ninnovation
      that will increase profit to *P~new~* (*P~new~* \\\\> *P~old~*).\\nIf the existing
      organization pursues the innovation, their profits will\\nthus increase by *\u2206P*
      := *P~new~* - *P~old~*. But a new organization\\nwill see its profits increase
      by *P~new~*: since the startup has no\\nexisting profit to replace, the rewards
      to innovation are higher. Thus\\ninnovation is more appealing for those without
      any economic stake in the\\nstatus quo.[^1^](#fn1)\\n\\nWe can see this play
      out today in the dynamic between Google and\\nOpenAI/Microsoft: Google already
      has a virtual monopoly in search, and\\nso is hesitant to replace what they
      have, whereas Microsoft has already\\nbeen losing in search and so is eager
      to replace Bing with ~~Sydney~~ an\\nAI-powered alternative. (It's to Apple's
      credit that they so eagerly\\npursued the iPhone when it meant effectively destroying
      the iPod, one of\\ntheir top money-makers.[^2^](#fn2))\\n\\nOne can also see
      this scenario in academia---plenty of established labs\\nhave programs built
      up around studying specific systems, and are thus\\ndisincentivized to study
      areas which might obviate projects they've\\nspent decades working on. For instance,
      labs dedicated to \\\"conventional\\\"\\nsynthetic methodology might be slower
      to turn to biocatalysis than a new\\nassistant professor with nothing to lose;
      labs that have spent decades\\nstudying protein folding might be slower to turn
      to AlphaFold than they\\nought to.\\n\\nAnother reason is that new entrants
      often have an advantage in\\nunderstanding the status quo. In *The Art of Doing
      Science and\\nEngineering* (book review coming, eventually), computing legend
      [Richard\\nHamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) discusses
      how\\nthere's often a disadvantage to being a pioneer in a field. Hamming's\\nargument,
      essentially, is that those who've had to invent something new\\nnever understand
      it as intuitively as those who have simply learned to\\ntake it for granted:\\n\\n>
      The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight through so\\n> many
      dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding and\\n> confusion,
      they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is\\n> open and the path
      made easy.... in time the same will probably be true\\n> of you.\\n\\nIn Hamming's
      view, it's the latecomers to a field who can see more\\nclearly the new possibilities
      opened by various innovations, and take\\nthe next steps towards previously
      unimaginable frontiers. There's a deep\\nirony in this: the very act of inventing
      something new makes you less\\nable to see the innovations enabled by your own
      work. The process of\\ninvention thus acts like a relay race, where newer generations\\ncontinually
      take the baton and push things forward before in turn\\ndropping back.\\n\\nI've
      heard these ideas discussed in terms of na\xEFvete before---the idea\\nbeing
      that innovation requires a sort of \\\"beginner's luck,\\\" a blind\\noptimism
      about what's possible that the experienced lack---but I think\\nthat's wrong.
      A belief in na\xEFvete as the key driver of innovation\\nimplies that excessive
      knowledge is detrimental: that it's possible to\\n\\\"know too much\\\" and
      cripple oneself. If anything, the opposite is true\\nin my experience. The most
      creative and productive people I've met are\\nthose with an utter mastery of
      the knowledge in their domain.\\n\\nHamming's proposal, which is more cognitive/subconscious,
      is thus\\ncomplementary to the more calculated logic of the Arrow replacement\\ntheorem:
      existing organizations are both less incentivized to innovate\\nand less able
      to see potential innovations. These ideas should be\\nencouraging to anyone
      at the beginning of their career: you are uniquely\\npoised to discover and
      exploit new opportunities! So consider this an\\nexhortation to go out and do
      so now (rather than waiting until you are\\nolder and more secure in your field).\\n\\n*Credit

      to get jobs, and research groups\nneed publications to win grants. So the incentives
      of everyone in the\nacademic system are aligned towards publishing papers, and
      lots of\npapers get published.\n\nIn contrast, the success or failure of a private
      company is---to a first\napproximation---unrelated to its publication record.
      Indeed, publication\nmight even be harmful for companies, insofar as time spent
      preparing\nmanuscripts and acquiring data [only needed for\npublication](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221214_against_carbon_nmr.html)\nis
      time that could be spent on more mission-critical activities.\n\nThat''s why
      I generally believe industry publications, especially those\nwhere no academic
      co-authors are involved, are underrated, and are\nprobably better than the journal
      they''re in might indicate. Getting a\npublication into a prestigious journal
      like *Science* or *Nature* is\npretty random, requires a lot of effort, and
      frequently has a slow\nturnaround time, whereas lower-tier journals are likely
      to accept your\nwork, and typically review and publish papers much, much faster.
      (In\nparticular, ACS is [among the fastest of all scientific\npublishers](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/11/08/guest-post-publishing-fast-and-slow-a-review-of-publishing-speed-in-the-last-decade/),\nand
      is generally a pleasure to work with.)\n\nThe above reflections were prompted
      by reading [an absolute gem of a\npaper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00452)
      in\n*J. Med. Chem.*, a collaboration between X-Chem, ZebiAI, and Google\nResearch.
      The paper is entitled \"Machine Learning on DNA-Encoded\nLibraries: A New Paradigm
      for Hit Finding\" and describes how data from\nDNA-encoded libraries (DELs)
      can be used to train ML models to predict\ncommercially available compounds
      with activity against a given target.\nThis is a really, really big deal. As
      the authors put it in their\nconclusion:\n\n> \\[Our approach\\] avoids the
      time-consuming and expensive process of\n> building new chemical matter into
      a DEL library and performing new\n> selections or incorporating new molecules
      into a HTS screening\n> library. This ability to consider compounds outside
      of the DEL is the\n> biggest advantage of our approach; notably, this approach
      can be used\n> at a fraction of the cost of a traditional DEL screening follow-up,\n>
      driven primarily by the large difference in synthesis cost.\n\nNow, the precise
      impact of this discovery will of course be determined\nin the years to come;
      Derek Lowe raises some fair concerns [on his\nblog](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/machine-learning-top-dna-encoded-libraries),\npointing
      out that the targets chosen are relatively easy to drug, and so\nprobably wouldn''t
      be the subject of a high-tech DEL screen anyway, and\nit''s entirely possible
      that there will be other unforeseen complications\nwith this technology that
      are only revealed in the context of a\nreal-world discovery pipeline. (Given
      that Relay [acquired\nZebiAI](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/relay-acquire-zebiai-ai-drug-discovery/598550/)\nfor
      \\$85M in 2021 essentially on the strength of this paper alone, I''m\nguessing
      plenty of real-world testing is already underway.)\n\nThe point I want to make
      is that if this paper had come from an academic\ngroup, I would be very, very
      surprised to see it in *J. Med Chem*. This\nproject has everything that one
      expects in a *Science* paper: a flashy\nnew piece of technology, a problem that''s
      understandable to a broad\naudience, clear clincal relevance, even a domain
      arbitrage angle. Yet\nthis paper is not in *Science*, nor *ACS Central Science*,
      nor even\n*JACS*, but in *J. Med. Chem.*, a journal I don''t even read regularly.\n\nMy
      conclusions from this are (1) to remember that not everyone is\nincentivized
      to market their own findings as strongly as academics are\nand (2) to try and
      look out for less-hyped industry results that I might\nneglect otherwise.\n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"114373961","updated":false,"category":"chemicalSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "If you are
      a scientist, odds are you should be reading the literature\nmore. This might
      not be true in every case---one can certainly imagine\nsomeone who reads the
      literature too much and never does any actual\nwork---but as a heuristic, my
      experience has been that most people would\nbenefit from reading more than they
      do, and often much more. Despite the\nsomewhat aggressive title, my hope in
      writing this is to encourage you\nto read the literature more: to make you excited
      about reading the\nliterature, not to guilt you into it or provoke anxiety.\n\n##
      Why You Should Read The Literature More\n\nYou should read the literature because
      you are a scientist, and your\nbusiness is ideas. The literature is the vast,
      messy, primal chaos that\ncontains centuries of scientific ideas. If you are
      an ideas worker, this\nis your raw material---this is what you work with. Not
      reading the\nliterature as an ideas worker is like not going to new restaurants
      as a\nnew chef, or not looking at other people''s art as an artist, or not\nlistening
      to music as a composer. Maybe the rare person has an internal\ncreativity so
      deep that they don''t need any external sources of\ninspiration, but I''m not
      sure I know anyone like that.\n\nIf you buy the concept of [\"domain\narbitrage\"](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230320_domain_arbitrage.html)\nI
      outlined last week, then reading the literature becomes doubly\nimportant for
      up-and-coming arbitrageurs. Not only do you need to stay\non top of research
      in your own field, but you also need to keep an eye\non other fields, to look
      for unexpected connections. It was only after\nmonths of reading physical chemistry
      papers about various IR\nspectroscopy techniques, with no direct goal in mind,
      that I realized I\ncould use *in situ* IR to [pin down the structure of ethereal\nHCl](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03622);
      simply\nreading organic chemistry papers would not have given me that insight.\n\n##
      How You Can Read The Literature More\n\nIf you don''t read the literature at
      all---like me, when I started\nundergrad---then you should start small. I usually
      recommend *JACS* to\nchemists. Just try to read every paper in your subfield
      in *JACS* for a\nfew months; I began by trying to read every organic chemistry
      paper in\n*JACS*. At the beginning, probably only 10--20% will make sense. But
      if\nyou push through and keep trying to make sense of things, eventually it\nwill
      get easier. You''ll start to see the same experiments repeated,\nunderstand
      the structure of different types of papers, and even\nrecognize certain turns
      of phrase. (This happened to me after about a\nyear and a half of reading the
      literature.)\n\nReading more papers makes you a faster reader. Here''s [Tyler\nCowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/how_to_read_fas.html)\non
      how he reads so quickly (not papers specifically, but still\napplicable):\n\n>
      The best way to read quickly is to read lots. And lots. And to have\n> started
      a long time ago. Then maybe you know what is coming in the\n> current book.
      Reading quickly is often, in a margin-relevant way,\n> close to not reading
      much at all.  \n>   \n> Note that when you add up the time costs of reading
      lots, quick\n> readers don''t consume information as efficiently as you might
      think.\n> They''ve chosen a path with high upfront costs and low marginal costs.\n>
      \\\"It took me 44 years to read this book\\\" is not a bad answer to many\n>
      questions about reading speed.\n\nAll of Tyler''s advice applies doubly to scientific
      writing, which is\noften jargon-filled and ordered in arcane ways. After 7ish
      years of\nreading the scientific literature, I can \"skim\" a *JACS* paper pretty\nquickly
      and determine what, if anything, is likely to be novel or\ninteresting to me,
      which makes staying on top of the literature much\neasier than it used to be.\n\nOnce
      you are good with a single journal, you can expand to multiple\njournals. A
      good starting set for organic chemistry is *JACS*,\n*Science*, *Nature*, *Nature
      Chemistry*, and *Angewandte*. If you\nalready know how to read papers quickly,
      it will not be very hard to\nread more and more papers. But expanding to new
      journals brings\nchallenges: how do you keep up with all of them at once? Lots
      of people\nuse an RSS feed to aggregate different journals---I use\n[Feedly](https://feedly.com/),
      as do several of my coworkers. (You can\nalso get this blog on Feedly!)\n\nI
      typically check Feedly many times a day on my phone; I can look at the\nTOC
      graphic, the abstract, and the title, and then if I like how the\npaper looks
      I''ll email it to myself. Every other day or so, I sit down\nat my computer
      with a cup of coffee and read through the papers I''ve\nemailed to myself. This
      is separate from my \"pursuing ideas from my\nresearch\"/\"doing a literature
      dive for group meeting\" way of reading the\nliterature---this is just to keep
      up with all the cool stuff that I\nwouldn''t otherwise hear about.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6796f124-b365-4b14-bb26-772a17a654a5_2056x280.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      Google Scholar Alerts to email me when new labs publish\nresults---I have probably
      20-30 labs set up this way, just to make sure\nI don''t miss results that might
      be important just because they''re not in\na high-profile journal.)\n\nKeeping
      track of papers you actually like and want to remember is\nanother challenge.
      For the past two years, I''ve put the URLs into a\nGoogle Sheet, along with
      a one-sentence summary of the paper, which\nhelps me look through my \"most
      liked\" papers when I want to find\nsomething. Sadly, I didn''t do this earlier,
      so I''m often tormented by\npapers I dimly remember but can no longer locate.\n\n##
      What Literature You Should Read\n\nThis obviously depends on what you''re doing,
      but I tend to think about\nliterature results in three categories:\n\n1.  Things
      every scientist should know about\n\n2.  Things I am supposed to be an expert
      on\n\n3.  Things I''m not supposed to be an expert on, but would still like
      to\n    know about\n\nCategory 1 basically covers the highest profile results
      (*Science* and\n*Nature*), and these days Twitter makes that pretty easy.\n\nCategory
      2 covers things \"in-field\" or directly related to my\nprojects---anything
      it would be somewhat embarrassing not to know about.\nFor me, this means *JACS*,
      *Angewandte*, *ACS Catalysis*, *Org. Lett.*,\n*OPRD*, *Organometallics*, *J.
      Org. Chem.*, and *Chem. Sci.* (I also\nfollow *Chem. Rev.* and *Chem. Soc. Rev.*,
      because review articles are\nnice.)\n\nCategory 3 covers things that I am excited
      to learn about. Right now,\nthat''s *JCTC* and *J. Phys. Chem. A--C*. In the
      past, that''s included\n*ACS Chem. Bio.*, *Nature Chem. Bio.*, and *Inorganic
      Chemistry*.\n(Writing this piece made me realize I should follow *JCIM* and
      *J. Chem.\nPhys.*, so I just added them to Feedly.)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReading
      the literature is---in the short term---pointless, sometimes\nfrustrating, and
      just a waste of time. It''s rare that the article you\nread today will lead
      to an insight on the problem you''re currently\nfacing! But the gains to knowledge
      compound over time, so spending time\nreading the literature today will make
      you a much better scientist in\nthe long run.\n\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen and Joe

      How You Can Read The Literature More\\n\\nIf you don't read the literature at
      all---like me, when I started\\nundergrad---then you should start small. I usually
      recommend *JACS* to\\nchemists. Just try to read every paper in your subfield
      in *JACS* for a\\nfew months; I began by trying to read every organic chemistry
      paper in\\n*JACS*. At the beginning, probably only 10--20% will make sense.
      But if\\nyou push through and keep trying to make sense of things, eventually
      it\\nwill get easier. You'll start to see the same experiments repeated,\\nunderstand
      the structure of different types of papers, and even\\nrecognize certain turns
      of phrase. (This happened to me after about a\\nyear and a half of reading the
      literature.)\\n\\nReading more papers makes you a faster reader. Here's [Tyler\\nCowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/how_to_read_fas.html)\\non
      how he reads so quickly (not papers specifically, but still\\napplicable):\\n\\n>
      The best way to read quickly is to read lots. And lots. And to have\\n> started
      a long time ago. Then maybe you know what is coming in the\\n> current book.

      \\\\\\\"It took me 44 years to read this book\\\\\\\" is not a bad answer to
      many\\n> questions about reading speed.\\n\\nAll of Tyler's advice applies doubly
      to scientific writing, which is\\noften jargon-filled and ordered in arcane
      ways. After 7ish years of\\nreading the scientific literature, I can \\\"skim\\\"
      a *JACS* paper pretty\\nquickly and determine what, if anything, is likely to
      be novel or\\ninteresting to me, which makes staying on top of the literature
      much\\neasier than it used to be.\\n\\nOnce you are good with a single journal,
      you can expand to multiple\\njournals. A good starting set for organic chemistry
      is *JACS*,\\n*Science*, *Nature*, *Nature Chemistry*, and *Angewandte*. If you\\nalready
      know how to read papers quickly, it will not be very hard to\\nread more and
      more papers. But expanding to new journals brings\\nchallenges: how do you keep
      up with all of them at once? Lots of people\\nuse an RSS feed to aggregate different
      journals---I use\\n[Feedly](https://feedly.com/), as do several of my coworkers.
      (You can\\nalso get this blog on Feedly!)\\n\\nI typically check Feedly many
      times a day on my phone; I can look at the\\nTOC graphic, the abstract, and
      the title, and then if I like how the\\npaper looks I'll email it to myself.
      Every other day or so, I sit down\\nat my computer with a cup of coffee and
      read through the papers I've\\nemailed to myself. This is separate from my \\\"pursuing
      ideas from my\\nresearch\\\"/\\\"doing a literature dive for group meeting\\\"
      way of reading the\\nliterature---this is just to keep up with all the cool

      use Google Scholar Alerts to email me when new labs publish\\nresults---I have
      probably 20-30 labs set up this way, just to make sure\\nI don't miss results
      that might be important just because they're not in\\na high-profile journal.)\\n\\nKeeping
      track of papers you actually like and want to remember is\\nanother challenge.

      so I'm often tormented by\\npapers I dimly remember but can no longer locate.\\n\\n##
      What Literature You Should Read\\n\\nThis obviously depends on what you're doing,
      but I tend to think about\\nliterature results in three categories:\\n\\n1.
      \ Things every scientist should know about\\n\\n2.  Things I am supposed to
      be an expert on\\n\\n3.  Things I'm not supposed to be an expert on, but would
      still like to\\n    know about\\n\\nCategory 1 basically covers the highest
      profile results (*Science* and\\n*Nature*), and these days Twitter makes that
      pretty easy.\\n\\nCategory 2 covers things \\\"in-field\\\" or directly related
      to my\\nprojects---anything it would be somewhat embarrassing not to know about.\\nFor
      me, this means *JACS*, *Angewandte*, *ACS Catalysis*, *Org. Lett.*,\\n*OPRD*,
      *Organometallics*, *J. Org. Chem.*, and *Chem. Sci.* (I also\\nfollow *Chem.
      Rev.* and *Chem. Soc. Rev.*, because review articles are\\nnice.)\\n\\nCategory
      3 covers things that I am excited to learn about. Right now,\\nthat's *JCTC*
      and *J. Phys. Chem. A--C*. In the past, that's included\\n*ACS Chem. Bio.*,
      *Nature Chem. Bio.*, and *Inorganic Chemistry*.\\n(Writing this piece made me
      realize I should follow *JCIM* and *J. Chem.\\nPhys.*, so I just added them
      to Feedly.)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReading the literature is---in the short
      term---pointless, sometimes\\nfrustrating, and just a waste of time. It's rare
      that the article you\\nread today will lead to an insight on the problem you're
      currently\\nfacing! But the gains to knowledge compound over time, so spending
      time\\nreading the literature today will make you a much better scientist in\\nthe
      long run.\\n\\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen and Joe Gair for reading drafts of this

      What Literature You Should Read\\n\\nThis obviously depends on what you're doing,
      but I tend to think about\\nliterature results in three categories:\\n\\n1.
      \ Things every scientist should know about\\n\\n2.  Things I am supposed to
      be an expert on\\n\\n3.  Things I'm not supposed to be an expert on, but would
      still like to\\n    know about\\n\\nCategory 1 basically covers the highest
      profile results (*Science* and\\n*Nature*), and these days Twitter makes that
      pretty easy.\\n\\nCategory 2 covers things \\\"in-field\\\" or directly related
      to my\\nprojects---anything it would be somewhat embarrassing not to know about.\\nFor
      me, this means *JACS*, *Angewandte*, *ACS Catalysis*, *Org. Lett.*,\\n*OPRD*,
      *Organometallics*, *J. Org. Chem.*, and *Chem. Sci.* (I also\\nfollow *Chem.
      Rev.* and *Chem. Soc. Rev.*, because review articles are\\nnice.)\\n\\nCategory
      3 covers things that I am excited to learn about. Right now,\\nthat's *JCTC*
      and *J. Phys. Chem. A--C*. In the past, that's included\\n*ACS Chem. Bio.*,
      *Nature Chem. Bio.*, and *Inorganic Chemistry*.\\n(Writing this piece made me
      realize I should follow *JCIM* and *J. Chem.\\nPhys.*, so I just added them
      to Feedly.)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReading the literature is---in the short
      term---pointless, sometimes\\nfrustrating, and just a waste of time. It's rare
      that the article you\\nread today will lead to an insight on the problem you're
      currently\\nfacing! But the gains to knowledge compound over time, so spending
      time\\nreading the literature today will make you a much better scientist in\\nthe
      long run.\\n\\n*Thanks to Ari Wagen and Joe Gair for reading drafts of this

      truth well-established that interdisciplinary research is good,\nand we all
      should be doing more of it (e.g. [this NSF\npage](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/learn-about-interdisciplinary-research)).\nI''ve
      always found this to be a bit uninspiring, though.\n\"Interdisciplinary research\"
      brings to mind a fashion collaboration,\nwhere the project is going to end up
      being some strange chimera, with\ngoals and methods taken at random from two
      unrelated fields.\n\nRather, I prefer the idea of \"domain arbitrage.\"[^1^](#fn1)
      Arbitrage,\nin economics, is taking advantage of price differences in different\nmarkets:
      if bread costs \\$7 in Cambridge but \\$4 in Boston, I can buy in\nBoston, sell
      in Cambridge, and pocket the difference. Since this is easy\nand requires very
      little from the arbitrageur, physical markets\ntypically lack opportunities
      for substantial arbitrage. In this case,\nthe efficient market hypothesis works
      well.\n\nKnowledge markets, however, are much less efficient than physical\nmarkets---many
      skills which are cheap in a certain domain are expensive\nin other domains.
      For instance, fields that employ organic synthesis,\nlike chemical biology or
      polymer chemistry, have much less synthetic\nexpertise than actual organic synthesis
      groups. The knowledge of how to\nuse a Schlenk line properly is cheap within
      organic chemistry but\nexpensive everywhere else. And organic chemists certainly
      don''t have a\nmonopoly on scarce skills: trained computer scientists are very
      scarce\nin most scientific fields, as are statisticians, despite the growing\nimportance
      of software and statistics to almost every area of research.\n\nDomain arbitrage,
      then, is taking knowledge that''s cheap in one domain\nto a domain where it''s
      expensive, and profiting from the difference. I\nlike this term better because
      it doesn''t imply that the goal of the\nresearch has to be interdisciplinary---instead,
      you''re solving problems\nthat people have always wanted to solve, just now
      with innovative\nmethods. And the concept of arbitrage highlights how this can
      be\nbeneficial for the practitioner. You''re bringing new insights to your\nfield
      so you can help your own research and make cool discoveries, not\nbecause you''ve
      been told that interdisciplinary work is good in an\nabstract way.\n\nThere
      are many examples of domain arbitrage,[^2^](#fn2) but perhaps my\nfavorite is
      the recent black hole image, which was largely due to work\nby Katie Bouman
      (formerly a graduate student at MIT, [now a professor at\nCaltech](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/)):\n\n:::

      black hole picture, extracted from noisy radio telescope\ndata by Bouman\u2019s
      new algorithms.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhat''s surprising is that Bouman
      didn''t have a background in astronomy\nat all: she \"hardly knew what a black
      hole was\" ([in her\nwords](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/katie-bouman-hardly-knew-what-a-black-hole-was-her-algorithm-helped-us-see-one))\nwhen
      she started working on the project. Instead, Bouman''s work drew on\nher background
      in computer vision, adapting statistical image models to\nthe task of reconstructing
      astronomical images. In [a 2016\npaper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Bouman_Computational_Imaging_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf),\nshe
      explicitly credits computer vision with the insights that would\nlater lead
      to the black hole image, and concludes by stating that\n\"astronomical imaging
      will benefit from the crossfertilization of ideas\nwith the computer vision
      community.\"\n\nIf we accept that domain arbitrage is important, why doesn''t
      it happen\nmore often? I can think of a few reasons: some fundamental, some\nstructural,
      and some cultural. On the fundamental level, domain\narbitrage requires knowledge
      of two fields of research at a\nmore-than-superficial level. This is relatively
      common for adjacent\nfields of research (like organic chemistry and inorganic
      chemistry), but\nbecomes increasingly rare as the distance between the two fields
      grows.\nIt''s not enough to just try and read journals from other fields\noccasionally---without
      the proper context, other fields are simply\nunintelligible. Given how hard
      achieving competence in a single area of\nstudy can be, we should not be surprised
      that those with a working\nknowledge of multiple fields are so scarce.\n\nThe
      structure of our research institutions also makes domain arbitrage\nharder.
      In theory, a 15-person research group could house scientists\nfrom a variety
      of backgrounds: chemists, biologists, mathematicians,\nengineers, and so forth,
      all focused on a common research goal. In\npractice, the high rate of turnover
      in academic positions makes this\nchallenging. Graduate students are only around
      for 5--6 years, postdocs\nfor fewer, and both positions are typically filled
      by people hoping to\nlearn things, not by already competent researchers. Thus,
      senior lab\nmembers must constantly train newer members in various techniques,\nskills,
      and ways of thinking so that institutional knowledge can be\npreserved.\n\nThis
      is hard but doable for a single area of research, but quickly\nbecomes untenable
      as the number of fields increases. A lab working in\ntwo fields has to pass
      down twice as much knowledge, with the same rate\nof personnel turnover. In
      practice, this often means that students end\nup deficient in one (or both)
      fields. As Derek Lowe put it [when\ndiscussing chemical\nbiology](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pipeline-1060)
      in\n2007:\n\n> I find a lot of \\[chemical biology\\] very interesting (though
      not\n> invariably), and some of it looks like it could lead to useful and\n>
      important things. My worry, though, is: what happens to the grad\n> students
      who do this stuff? They run the risk of spending too much\n> time on biology
      to be completely competent chemists, and vice versa.\n\nTo me, this seems like
      a case in which the two goals of the research\nuniversity---to teach students
      and to produce research---are at odds.\nIt''s easier to teach students in single-domain
      labs, but the research\nthat comes from multiple domains is superior. It''s
      not easy to think\nabout how to address this without fundamental change to the
      structure of\nuniversities (although perhaps others have more creative proposals
      than\nI).[^3^](#fn3)\n\nBut, perhaps most frustratingly, cultural factors also
      contribute to the\nrarity of domain arbitrage. Many scientific disciplines today
      define\nthemselves not by the questions they''re trying to solve but by the\nmethods
      they employ, which disincentivizes developing innovative\nmethods. For example,
      many organic chemists feel that biocatalysis\nshouldn''t be considered organic
      synthesis, since it employs enzymes and\ncofactors instead of more traditional
      catalysts and reagents, even\nthough organic synthesis and biocatalysis both
      address the same goal:\nmaking molecules. While it''s somewhat inevitable that
      years of lab work\nleaves one with a certain affection for the methods one employs,
      it''s\nalso irrational.\n\nNow, one might reasonably argue that precisely delimiting
      where one\nscientific field begins and another ends is a pointless exercise.
      Who''s\nto say whether biocatalysis is better viewed as the domain of organic\nchemistry
      or biochemistry? While this is fair, it''s also true that the\nscientific field
      one formally belongs to matters a great deal. If\nsociety deems me an organic
      chemist, then overwhelmingly it is other\norganic chemists who will decide if
      I get a PhD, if I obtain tenure as a\nprofessor, and if my proposals are funded.[^4^](#fn4)\n\nGiven
      that the success or failure of my scientific career thus depends\non the opinion
      of other organic chemists, it starts to become apparent\nwhy domain arbitrage
      is difficult. If I attempt to solve problems in\norganic chemistry by introducing
      techniques from another field, it''s\nlikely that my peers will be confused
      or skeptical by my work, and\nhesitate to accept it as \"real\" organic chemistry
      (see, for instance,\nthe biocatalysis scenario above). Conversely, if I attempt
      to solve\nproblems in other domains with the tools of organic chemistry, my
      peers\nwill likely be uninterested in the outcome of the research, even if they\napprove
      of the methods employed. So from either angle domain arbitrage\nis disfavored.\n\nThe
      factors discussed here don''t serve to completely halt domain\narbitrage, as
      successful arbitrageurs like Katie Bouman or Frances\nArnold demonstrate, but
      they do act to inhibit it. If we accept the\nclaim that domain arbitrage is
      good, and we should be working to make it\nmore common, what then should we
      do to address these problems? One could\nenvision a number of structural solutions,
      which I won''t get into here,\nbut on a personal level the conclusion is obvious:
      if you care about\nperforming cutting-edge research, it''s important to learn
      things outside\nthe narrow area that you specialize in and not silo yourself
      within a\nsingle discipline.\n\n*Thanks to Shlomo Klapper and Darren Zhu for

      did not coin this term---credit goes to Shlomo Klapper. I do think\n    this
      is the first time it\\''s been used in writing, however.\n\n2.  I\\''ll actually
      go a step farther and propose the Strong Theorem of\n    Domain Arbitrage: All
      non-incremental scientific discoveries arise\n    either from domain arbitrage
      or random chance. I don\\''t want to\n    defend it here, but I think there\\''s
      a reasonable chance that this\n    is true.\n\n3.  Collaborations between differently
      skilled labs help with this\n    problem, but the logistical and practical challenges
      involved in\n    collaboration make this an inefficient solution. Plus, the
      same\n    cultural challenges still confront the individual contributors.\n\n4.  [This\n    tweet](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry/status/1637496308935057409),\n    quoting

      a truth well-established that interdisciplinary research is good,\\nand we all
      should be doing more of it (e.g. [this NSF\\npage](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/learn-about-interdisciplinary-research)).\\nI've
      always found this to be a bit uninspiring, though.\\n\\\"Interdisciplinary research\\\"
      brings to mind a fashion collaboration,\\nwhere the project is going to end
      up being some strange chimera, with\\ngoals and methods taken at random from
      two unrelated fields.\\n\\nRather, I prefer the idea of \\\"domain arbitrage.\\\"[^1^](#fn1)
      Arbitrage,\\nin economics, is taking advantage of price differences in different\\nmarkets:
      if bread costs \\\\$7 in Cambridge but \\\\$4 in Boston, I can buy in\\nBoston,
      sell in Cambridge, and pocket the difference. Since this is easy\\nand requires
      very little from the arbitrageur, physical markets\\ntypically lack opportunities
      for substantial arbitrage. In this case,\\nthe efficient market hypothesis works
      well.\\n\\nKnowledge markets, however, are much less efficient than physical\\nmarkets---many
      skills which are cheap in a certain domain are expensive\\nin other domains.
      For instance, fields that employ organic synthesis,\\nlike chemical biology
      or polymer chemistry, have much less synthetic\\nexpertise than actual organic
      synthesis groups. The knowledge of how to\\nuse a Schlenk line properly is cheap
      within organic chemistry but\\nexpensive everywhere else. And organic chemists
      certainly don't have a\\nmonopoly on scarce skills: trained computer scientists
      are very scarce\\nin most scientific fields, as are statisticians, despite the
      growing\\nimportance of software and statistics to almost every area of research.\\n\\nDomain
      arbitrage, then, is taking knowledge that's cheap in one domain\\nto a domain
      where it's expensive, and profiting from the difference. I\\nlike this term
      better because it doesn't imply that the goal of the\\nresearch has to be interdisciplinary---instead,
      you're solving problems\\nthat people have always wanted to solve, just now
      with innovative\\nmethods. And the concept of arbitrage highlights how this
      can be\\nbeneficial for the practitioner. You're bringing new insights to your\\nfield
      so you can help your own research and make cool discoveries, not\\nbecause you've
      been told that interdisciplinary work is good in an\\nabstract way.\\n\\nThere
      are many examples of domain arbitrage,[^2^](#fn2) but perhaps my\\nfavorite
      is the recent black hole image, which was largely due to work\\nby Katie Bouman
      (formerly a graduate student at MIT, [now a professor at\\nCaltech](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/)):\\n\\n:::

      black hole picture, extracted from noisy radio telescope\\ndata by Bouman\u2019s
      new algorithms.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhat's surprising is that
      Bouman didn't have a background in astronomy\\nat all: she \\\"hardly knew what
      a black hole was\\\" ([in her\\nwords](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/katie-bouman-hardly-knew-what-a-black-hole-was-her-algorithm-helped-us-see-one))\\nwhen
      she started working on the project. Instead, Bouman's work drew on\\nher background
      in computer vision, adapting statistical image models to\\nthe task of reconstructing
      astronomical images. In [a 2016\\npaper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Bouman_Computational_Imaging_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf),\\nshe
      explicitly credits computer vision with the insights that would\\nlater lead
      to the black hole image, and concludes by stating that\\n\\\"astronomical imaging
      will benefit from the crossfertilization of ideas\\nwith the computer vision
      community.\\\"\\n\\nIf we accept that domain arbitrage is important, why doesn't
      it happen\\nmore often? I can think of a few reasons: some fundamental, some\\nstructural,
      and some cultural. On the fundamental level, domain\\narbitrage requires knowledge
      of two fields of research at a\\nmore-than-superficial level. This is relatively
      common for adjacent\\nfields of research (like organic chemistry and inorganic
      chemistry), but\\nbecomes increasingly rare as the distance between the two
      fields grows.\\nIt's not enough to just try and read journals from other fields\\noccasionally---without
      the proper context, other fields are simply\\nunintelligible. Given how hard
      achieving competence in a single area of\\nstudy can be, we should not be surprised
      that those with a working\\nknowledge of multiple fields are so scarce.\\n\\nThe
      structure of our research institutions also makes domain arbitrage\\nharder.
      In theory, a 15-person research group could house scientists\\nfrom a variety
      of backgrounds: chemists, biologists, mathematicians,\\nengineers, and so forth,
      all focused on a common research goal. In\\npractice, the high rate of turnover
      in academic positions makes this\\nchallenging. Graduate students are only around
      for 5--6 years, postdocs\\nfor fewer, and both positions are typically filled
      by people hoping to\\nlearn things, not by already competent researchers. Thus,
      senior lab\\nmembers must constantly train newer members in various techniques,\\nskills,
      and ways of thinking so that institutional knowledge can be\\npreserved.\\n\\nThis
      is hard but doable for a single area of research, but quickly\\nbecomes untenable
      as the number of fields increases. A lab working in\\ntwo fields has to pass
      down twice as much knowledge, with the same rate\\nof personnel turnover. In
      practice, this often means that students end\\nup deficient in one (or both)
      fields. As Derek Lowe put it [when\\ndiscussing chemical\\nbiology](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pipeline-1060)
      in\\n2007:\\n\\n> I find a lot of \\\\[chemical biology\\\\] very interesting
      (though not\\n> invariably), and some of it looks like it could lead to useful
      and\\n> important things. My worry, though, is: what happens to the grad\\n>
      students who do this stuff? They run the risk of spending too much\\n> time
      on biology to be completely competent chemists, and vice versa.\\n\\nTo me,
      this seems like a case in which the two goals of the research\\nuniversity---to
      teach students and to produce research---are at odds.\\nIt's easier to teach
      students in single-domain labs, but the research\\nthat comes from multiple
      domains is superior. It's not easy to think\\nabout how to address this without
      fundamental change to the structure of\\nuniversities (although perhaps others
      have more creative proposals than\\nI).[^3^](#fn3)\\n\\nBut, perhaps most frustratingly,
      cultural factors also contribute to the\\nrarity of domain arbitrage. Many scientific
      disciplines today define\\nthemselves not by the questions they're trying to
      solve but by the\\nmethods they employ, which disincentivizes developing innovative\\nmethods.
      For example, many organic chemists feel that biocatalysis\\nshouldn't be considered
      organic synthesis, since it employs enzymes and\\ncofactors instead of more
      traditional catalysts and reagents, even\\nthough organic synthesis and biocatalysis
      both address the same goal:\\nmaking molecules. While it's somewhat inevitable
      that years of lab work\\nleaves one with a certain affection for the methods
      one employs, it's\\nalso irrational.\\n\\nNow, one might reasonably argue that
      precisely delimiting where one\\nscientific field begins and another ends is
      a pointless exercise. Who's\\nto say whether biocatalysis is better viewed as
      the domain of organic\\nchemistry or biochemistry? While this is fair, it's
      also true that the\\nscientific field one formally belongs to matters a great
      deal. If\\nsociety deems me an organic chemist, then overwhelmingly it is other\\norganic
      chemists who will decide if I get a PhD, if I obtain tenure as a\\nprofessor,
      and if my proposals are funded.[^4^](#fn4)\\n\\nGiven that the success or failure
      of my scientific career thus depends\\non the opinion of other organic chemists,
      it starts to become apparent\\nwhy domain arbitrage is difficult. If I attempt
      to solve problems in\\norganic chemistry by introducing techniques from another
      field, it's\\nlikely that my peers will be confused or skeptical by my work,
      and\\nhesitate to accept it as \\\"real\\\" organic chemistry (see, for instance,\\nthe
      biocatalysis scenario above). Conversely, if I attempt to solve\\nproblems in
      other domains with the tools of organic chemistry, my peers\\nwill likely be
      uninterested in the outcome of the research, even if they\\napprove of the methods
      employed. So from either angle domain arbitrage\\nis disfavored.\\n\\nThe factors
      discussed here don't serve to completely halt domain\\narbitrage, as successful
      arbitrageurs like Katie Bouman or Frances\\nArnold demonstrate, but they do
      act to inhibit it. If we accept the\\nclaim that domain arbitrage is good, and
      we should be working to make it\\nmore common, what then should we do to address
      these problems? One could\\nenvision a number of structural solutions, which
      I won't get into here,\\nbut on a personal level the conclusion is obvious:
      if you care about\\nperforming cutting-edge research, it's important to learn
      things outside\\nthe narrow area that you specialize in and not silo yourself
      within a\\nsingle discipline.\\n\\n*Thanks to Shlomo Klapper and Darren Zhu
      for helpful discussions. Thanks\\nalso to Ari Wagen, Eric Gilliam, and Joe Gair

      a truth well-established that interdisciplinary research is good,\\nand we all
      should be doing more of it (e.g. [this NSF\\npage](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/learn-about-interdisciplinary-research)).\\nI've
      always found this to be a bit uninspiring, though.\\n\\\"Interdisciplinary research\\\"
      brings to mind a fashion collaboration,\\nwhere the project is going to end
      up being some strange chimera, with\\ngoals and methods taken at random from
      two unrelated fields.\\n\\nRather, I prefer the idea of \\\"domain arbitrage.\\\"[^1^](#fn1)
      Arbitrage,\\nin economics, is taking advantage of price differences in different\\nmarkets:
      if bread costs \\\\$7 in Cambridge but \\\\$4 in Boston, I can buy in\\nBoston,
      sell in Cambridge, and pocket the difference. Since this is easy\\nand requires
      very little from the arbitrageur, physical markets\\ntypically lack opportunities
      for substantial arbitrage. In this case,\\nthe efficient market hypothesis works
      well.\\n\\nKnowledge markets, however, are much less efficient than physical\\nmarkets---many
      skills which are cheap in a certain domain are expensive\\nin other domains.
      For instance, fields that employ organic synthesis,\\nlike chemical biology
      or polymer chemistry, have much less synthetic\\nexpertise than actual organic
      synthesis groups. The knowledge of how to\\nuse a Schlenk line properly is cheap
      within organic chemistry but\\nexpensive everywhere else. And organic chemists
      certainly don't have a\\nmonopoly on scarce skills: trained computer scientists
      are very scarce\\nin most scientific fields, as are statisticians, despite the
      growing\\nimportance of software and statistics to almost every area of research.\\n\\nDomain
      arbitrage, then, is taking knowledge that's cheap in one domain\\nto a domain
      where it's expensive, and profiting from the difference. I\\nlike this term
      better because it doesn't imply that the goal of the\\nresearch has to be interdisciplinary---instead,
      you're solving problems\\nthat people have always wanted to solve, just now
      with innovative\\nmethods. And the concept of arbitrage highlights how this
      can be\\nbeneficial for the practitioner. You're bringing new insights to your\\nfield
      so you can help your own research and make cool discoveries, not\\nbecause you've
      been told that interdisciplinary work is good in an\\nabstract way.\\n\\nThere
      are many examples of domain arbitrage,[^2^](#fn2) but perhaps my\\nfavorite
      is the recent black hole image, which was largely due to work\\nby Katie Bouman
      (formerly a graduate student at MIT, [now a professor at\\nCaltech](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/)):\\n\\n:::

      new algorithms.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhat's surprising is that
      Bouman didn't have a background in astronomy\\nat all: she \\\"hardly knew what
      a black hole was\\\" ([in her\\nwords](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/katie-bouman-hardly-knew-what-a-black-hole-was-her-algorithm-helped-us-see-one))\\nwhen
      she started working on the project. Instead, Bouman's work drew on\\nher background
      in computer vision, adapting statistical image models to\\nthe task of reconstructing
      astronomical images. In [a 2016\\npaper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Bouman_Computational_Imaging_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf),\\nshe
      explicitly credits computer vision with the insights that would\\nlater lead
      to the black hole image, and concludes by stating that\\n\\\"astronomical imaging
      will benefit from the crossfertilization of ideas\\nwith the computer vision
      community.\\\"\\n\\nIf we accept that domain arbitrage is important, why doesn't
      it happen\\nmore often? I can think of a few reasons: some fundamental, some\\nstructural,
      and some cultural. On the fundamental level, domain\\narbitrage requires knowledge
      of two fields of research at a\\nmore-than-superficial level. This is relatively
      common for adjacent\\nfields of research (like organic chemistry and inorganic
      chemistry), but\\nbecomes increasingly rare as the distance between the two
      fields grows.\\nIt's not enough to just try and read journals from other fields\\noccasionally---without
      the proper context, other fields are simply\\nunintelligible. Given how hard
      achieving competence in a single area of\\nstudy can be, we should not be surprised
      that those with a working\\nknowledge of multiple fields are so scarce.\\n\\nThe
      structure of our research institutions also makes domain arbitrage\\nharder.
      In theory, a 15-person research group could house scientists\\nfrom a variety
      of backgrounds: chemists, biologists, mathematicians,\\nengineers, and so forth,
      all focused on a common research goal. In\\npractice, the high rate of turnover
      in academic positions makes this\\nchallenging. Graduate students are only around
      for 5--6 years, postdocs\\nfor fewer, and both positions are typically filled
      by people hoping to\\nlearn things, not by already competent researchers. Thus,
      senior lab\\nmembers must constantly train newer members in various techniques,\\nskills,
      and ways of thinking so that institutional knowledge can be\\npreserved.\\n\\nThis
      is hard but doable for a single area of research, but quickly\\nbecomes untenable
      as the number of fields increases. A lab working in\\ntwo fields has to pass
      down twice as much knowledge, with the same rate\\nof personnel turnover. In
      practice, this often means that students end\\nup deficient in one (or both)
      fields. As Derek Lowe put it [when\\ndiscussing chemical\\nbiology](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pipeline-1060)
      in\\n2007:\\n\\n> I find a lot of \\\\[chemical biology\\\\] very interesting
      (though not\\n> invariably), and some of it looks like it could lead to useful
      and\\n> important things. My worry, though, is: what happens to the grad\\n>
      students who do this stuff? They run the risk of spending too much\\n> time
      on biology to be completely competent chemists, and vice versa.\\n\\nTo me,
      this seems like a case in which the two goals of the research\\nuniversity---to
      teach students and to produce research---are at odds.\\nIt's easier to teach
      students in single-domain labs, but the research\\nthat comes from multiple
      domains is superior. It's not easy to think\\nabout how to address this without
      fundamental change to the structure of\\nuniversities (although perhaps others
      have more creative proposals than\\nI).[^3^](#fn3)\\n\\nBut, perhaps most frustratingly,
      cultural factors also contribute to the\\nrarity of domain arbitrage. Many scientific
      disciplines today define\\nthemselves not by the questions they're trying to
      solve but by the\\nmethods they employ, which disincentivizes developing innovative\\nmethods.
      For example, many organic chemists feel that biocatalysis\\nshouldn't be considered
      organic synthesis, since it employs enzymes and\\ncofactors instead of more
      traditional catalysts and reagents, even\\nthough organic synthesis and biocatalysis
      both address the same goal:\\nmaking molecules. While it's somewhat inevitable
      that years of lab work\\nleaves one with a certain affection for the methods
      one employs, it's\\nalso irrational.\\n\\nNow, one might reasonably argue that
      precisely delimiting where one\\nscientific field begins and another ends is
      a pointless exercise. Who's\\nto say whether biocatalysis is better viewed as
      the domain of organic\\nchemistry or biochemistry? While this is fair, it's
      also true that the\\nscientific field one formally belongs to matters a great
      deal. If\\nsociety deems me an organic chemist, then overwhelmingly it is other\\norganic
      chemists who will decide if I get a PhD, if I obtain tenure as a\\nprofessor,
      and if my proposals are funded.[^4^](#fn4)\\n\\nGiven that the success or failure
      of my scientific career thus depends\\non the opinion of other organic chemists,
      it starts to become apparent\\nwhy domain arbitrage is difficult. If I attempt
      to solve problems in\\norganic chemistry by introducing techniques from another
      field, it's\\nlikely that my peers will be confused or skeptical by my work,
      and\\nhesitate to accept it as \\\"real\\\" organic chemistry (see, for instance,\\nthe
      biocatalysis scenario above). Conversely, if I attempt to solve\\nproblems in
      other domains with the tools of organic chemistry, my peers\\nwill likely be
      uninterested in the outcome of the research, even if they\\napprove of the methods
      employed. So from either angle domain arbitrage\\nis disfavored.\\n\\nThe factors
      discussed here don't serve to completely halt domain\\narbitrage, as successful
      arbitrageurs like Katie Bouman or Frances\\nArnold demonstrate, but they do
      act to inhibit it. If we accept the\\nclaim that domain arbitrage is good, and
      we should be working to make it\\nmore common, what then should we do to address
      these problems? One could\\nenvision a number of structural solutions, which
      I won't get into here,\\nbut on a personal level the conclusion is obvious:
      if you care about\\nperforming cutting-edge research, it's important to learn
      things outside\\nthe narrow area that you specialize in and not silo yourself
      within a\\nsingle discipline.\\n\\n*Thanks to Shlomo Klapper and Darren Zhu

      "blog_name": "Corin Wagen", "blog_slug": "cwagen", "content_text": "Recently,
      I''ve been working to assign the relative configuration of some\ntricky diastereomers,
      which has led me to do a bit of a deep dive into\nthe world of computational
      NMR prediction. Having spent the last week or\nso researching the current state-of-the-art
      in simulating experimental\n^1^H NMR spectra, I''m excited to share some of
      my findings.\n\nMy main resource in this quest has been [a new NMR benchmarking\npaper](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/6/2449),
      published on March 7th\nby authors from Merck (and a few other places). Why
      this paper in\nparticular? Although there have been many NMR benchmarks, not
      all of\nthese papers are as useful as they seem. Broadly speaking, there are
      two\nways to benchmark NMR shifts: (1) against high-level computed results or\n(2)
      against experimental NMR shifts.\n\nThe first strategy seems to be popular with
      theoretical chemists: NMR\nshifts at a very high level of theory are presumably
      very accurate, and\nso if we can just reproduce those values with a cheap method,
      we will\nhave solved the NMR prediction problem. Of course, effects due to\nsolvation
      and vibrational motion will be ignored, but these effects can\nalways be corrected
      for later. In contrast, the second strategy is more\nuseful for experimental
      chemists: if the calculation is going to be\ncompared to experimental NMR spectra
      in CDCl~3~ solution, the match with\nexperiment is much more important than
      the gas-phase accuracy of the\nfunctional employed.\n\nNot only are these two
      approaches different in theory, they yield vastly\ndifferent results in practice,
      as is nicely illustrated by the case of\nthe double-hybrid functional DSD-PBEP86.
      DSD-PBEP86 was [first reported\nin 2018](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00624)
      by\nFrank Neese and coworkers, who found it to be much superior to regular\nDFT
      methods or MP2-type wavefunction methods at reproducing CCSD(T)\nreference data.[^1^](#fn1)
      [A subsequent\nbenchmark](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00919)
      by\nKaupp and coworkers looked at a much larger set of compounds and\nconfirmed
      that DSD-PBEP86 was indeed superior at reproducing CCSD(T)\ndata, with a mean
      absolute error (MAE) for ^1^H of 0.06 ppm. In\ncontrast, [de Oliveira and\ncoworkers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00604)
      found\nthat DSD-PBEP86 and related double-hybrid methods were much worse at\npredicting
      experimental ^1^H NMR shifts, with a MAE of 0.20 ppm, making\nthem no better
      than conventional DFT approaches.\n\nThe difference between these two mindsets
      is nicely demonstrated by\nKaupp''s paper, which dismisses de Oliveira''s work
      as suffering from\n\"methodological inadequacies\" and states:\n\n> \\[Benchmarking\\]
      can be done by comparing approximative calculations\n> to experimental data
      or to data computed using high-level ab initio\n> methodologies. The latter
      helps to eliminate a number of factors that\n> often complicate the direct comparison
      against experiment, such as\n> environmental, ro-vibrational, or thermal contributions
      (possibly also\n> relativistic effects, see below).\n\nWhile Kaupp is correct
      that using gas-phase CCSD(T) data does eliminate\n\"environmental\" effects
      (e.g. from solvent), it''s not clear that these\neffects always ought to be
      eliminated! Although directly optimizing a\ncomputational method to reproduce
      a bunch of ill-defined environmental\neffects is perhaps inelegant, it''s certainly
      pragmatic.\n\nThe authors of the 2023 benchmark create a new set of well-behaved\nreference
      compounds that avoid troublesome heavy-atom effects (poorly\nhandled by most
      conventional calculations) or low-lying conformational\nequilibria, and re-acquire
      experimental spectra (in chloroform) for\nevery compound in the set. They then
      score a wide variety of\ncomputational methods against this dataset: functionals,
      basis sets,\nimplicit solvent methods, and more.\n\nIn the end, [Cramer''s WP04\nfunctional](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct6001016)
      is found to be\nbest, which is perhaps unsurprising given that it was specifically\noptimized
      for the prediction of ^1^H shifts in chloroform.[^2^](#fn2)\nThe WP04/6-311++G(2d,p)/PCM(chloroform)
      level of theory is optima,\ngiving an MAE of 0.08 ppm against experiment, but\nWP04/jul-CC-PVDZ/PCM(chloroform)
      is cheaper and not much worse.\nB3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) works fine for geometry optimization,
      as do\nwB97X-D/6-31G(d) and M06-2X/6-31G(d).\n\nBased on these results, my final
      workflow for predicting experimental\nproton spectra is:\n\n1.  [Run a conformational
      search\n    using](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221219_low_code_csearch.html)\n    *[crest](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221219_low_code_csearch.html)*.\n\n2.  Optimize
      each conformer using B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31G(d).\n\n3.  Remove duplicate conformers
      with\n    cctk.ConformationalEnsemble.eliminate_redundant().\n\n4.  Predict
      NMR shifts for each conformer using\n    WP04/6-311++G(2d,p)/PCM(chloroform).\n\n5.  Combine
      conformer predictions through [Boltzmann\n    weighting](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221228_boltzmann_error.html),\n    and
      apply a linear correction.\n\nFor small molecules, this workflow runs extremely

      effects due to\\nsolvation and vibrational motion will be ignored, but these
      effects can\\nalways be corrected for later. In contrast, the second strategy
      is more\\nuseful for experimental chemists: if the calculation is going to be\\ncompared

      line of Python must be interpreted, type checked, and\nso forth (see this [little\noverview](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/interpreters-run-python-code)\nof
      what the Python interpreter does).\n\nFortunately for those of us who like programming
      in Python, there are a\nnumber of different ways to make Python code faster.
      The simplest way is\njust to use NumPy, the *de facto* standard for any sort
      of array-based\ncomputation in Python; NumPy functions are written in C/C++,
      and so are\nmuch faster than the corresponding native Python functions.\n\nAnother
      strategy is to use a just-in-time compiler to accelerate Python\ncode, like
      Jax or Numba. This approach incurs a substantial *O*(1) cost\n(compilation)
      but makes all subsequent calls orders of magnitude faster.\nUnfortunately, these
      libraries don''t support all possible Python\nfunctions or external libraries,
      meaning that sometimes it''s difficult\nto write JIT-compilable code.\n\nHow
      do these strategies fare on a real-world problem? I selected\npairwise distance
      calculations for a list of points as a test case; this\nproblem is pretty common
      in a lot of scientific contexts, including\ncalculating electrostatic interactions
      in molecular dynamics or quantum\nmechanics.\n\nWe can start by importing the
      necessary libraries and writing two\nfunctions. The first function is the \"na\u00efve\"
      Python approach, and the\nsecond uses scipy.spatial.distance.cdist, one of the
      most\n[overpowered](https://github.com/ekwan/cctk/blob/master/cctk/molecule.py#L170)\nfunctions
      I''ve encountered in any Python library.\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import
      numba\n    import cctk\n    import scipy\n\n    mol = cctk.XYZFile.read_file(\"30_dcm.xyz\").get_molecule()\n    points
      = mol.geometry.view(np.ndarray)\n\n    def naive_get_distance(points):\n        N
      = points.shape[0]\n        distances = np.zeros(shape=(N,N))\n        for i,
      A in enumerate(points):\n            for j, B in enumerate(points):\n                distances[i,j]
      = np.linalg.norm(A-B)\n        return distances\n\n    def scipy_get_distance(points):\n        return
      scipy.spatial.distance.cdist(points,points)\n\nIf we score these functions in
      Jupyter, we can see that cdist is almost\n2000 times faster than the pure Python
      function!\n\n    %%timeit\n    naive_get_distance(points)\n\n    103 ms \u00b1

      loops each)\n\nIn this case, it''s pretty obvious that we should just use cdist.
      But\nwhat if there wasn''t a magic built-in function for this task---how close\ncan
      we get to the performance of cdist with other performance\noptimizations?\n\nThe
      first and most obvious optimization is simply to take advantage of\nthe symmetry
      of the matrix, and not compute entries below the diagonal.\n(Note that this
      is sort of cheating, since cdist doesn''t know that both\narguments are the
      same.)\n\n    def triangle_get_distance(points):\n        N = points.shape[0]\n        distances
      = np.zeros(shape=(N,N))\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i,N):\n                distances[i,j]
      = np.linalg.norm(points[i]-points[j])\n                distances[j,i] = distances[i,j]\n        return
      distances\n\nAs expected, this roughly halves our time:\n\n    %%timeit\n    triangle_get_distance(points)\n\n    57.6
      ms \u00b1 409 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\n\nNext,
      we can use Numba to compile this function. This yields roughly a\n10-fold speedup,
      bringing us to about two orders of magnitude slower\nthan cdist.\n\n    numba_triangle_get_distance
      = numba.njit(triangle_get_distance)\n\n    %%timeit\n    numba_triangle_get_distance(points)\n\n    5.74
      ms \u00b1 36.2 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops
      each)\n\nDefining our own norm with Numba, instead of using np.linalg.norm,
      gives\nus another nice boost:\n\n    def custom_norm(AB):\n        return np.sqrt(AB[0]*AB[0]
      + AB[1]*AB[1] + AB[2]*AB[2])\n\n    numba_custom_norm = numba.njit(custom_norm)\n\n    def
      cn_triangle_get_distance(points):\n        N = points.shape[0]\n        distances
      = np.zeros(shape=(N,N))\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i,N):\n                distances[i,j]
      = numba_custom_norm(points[i] - points[j])\n                distances[j,i] =
      distances[i,j]\n        return distances\n\n    numba_cn_triangle_get_distance
      = numba.njit(cn_triangle_get_distance)\n\n    %%timeit\n    numba_cn_triangle_get_distance(points)\n\n    1.35
      ms \u00b1 21.6 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops
      each)\n\nWhat about trying to write this program using only vectorized NumPy\nfunctions?
      This takes a bit more creativity; I came up with the\nfollowing function, which
      is a bit memory-inefficient but still runs\nquite quickly:\n\n    def numpy_get_distance(points):\n        N
      = points.shape[0]\n\n        points_row = np.repeat(np.expand_dims(points,1),
      N, axis=1)\n        points_col = np.repeat(np.expand_dims(points,0), N, axis=0)\n\n        sq_diff
      = np.square(np.subtract(points_row, points_col))\n        return np.sqrt(np.sum(sq_diff,
      axis=2))\n\n    %%timeit\n    numpy_get_distance(points)\n\n    426 \u00b5s
      \u00b1 6.34 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\n\nUnfortunately,
      calling np.repeat with arguments [isn''t supported by\nNumba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html),\nmeaning
      that I had to get a bit more creative to write a\nNumba-compilable version of
      the previous program. The best solution that\nI found involved a few array reshaping
      operations, which are\n(presumably) pretty inefficient, and the final code only
      runs a little\nbit faster than the Numpy-only version.\n\n    def numpy_get_distance2(points):\n        N
      = points.shape[0]\n\n        points_row = np.swapaxes(points.repeat(N).reshape((N,3,N)),1,2)\n        points_col

      is an easy language to write, but it's also\\n[very](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html)\\n[slow](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/problem/nbody).\\nSince
      it's a dynamically typed and interpreted language, every Python\\noperation
      is much slower than the corresponding operation would be in C\\nor FORTRAN---every
      line of Python must be interpreted, type checked, and\\nso forth (see this [little\\noverview](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/interpreters-run-python-code)\\nof
      what the Python interpreter does).\\n\\nFortunately for those of us who like
      programming in Python, there are a\\nnumber of different ways to make Python
      code faster. The simplest way is\\njust to use NumPy, the *de facto* standard
      for any sort of array-based\\ncomputation in Python; NumPy functions are written
      in C/C++, and so are\\nmuch faster than the corresponding native Python functions.\\n\\nAnother
      strategy is to use a just-in-time compiler to accelerate Python\\ncode, like
      Jax or Numba. This approach incurs a substantial *O*(1) cost\\n(compilation)
      but makes all subsequent calls orders of magnitude faster.\\nUnfortunately,
      these libraries don't support all possible Python\\nfunctions or external libraries,
      meaning that sometimes it's difficult\\nto write JIT-compilable code.\\n\\nHow
      do these strategies fare on a real-world problem? I selected\\npairwise distance
      calculations for a list of points as a test case; this\\nproblem is pretty common
      in a lot of scientific contexts, including\\ncalculating electrostatic interactions
      in molecular dynamics or quantum\\nmechanics.\\n\\nWe can start by importing
      the necessary libraries and writing two\\nfunctions. The first function is the
      \\\"na\xEFve\\\" Python approach, and the\\nsecond uses scipy.spatial.distance.cdist,
      one of the most\\n[overpowered](https://github.com/ekwan/cctk/blob/master/cctk/molecule.py#L170)\\nfunctions
      I've encountered in any Python library.\\n\\n    import numpy as np\\n    import
      numba\\n    import cctk\\n    import scipy\\n\\n    mol = cctk.XYZFile.read_file(\\\"30_dcm.xyz\\\").get_molecule()\\n
      \   points = mol.geometry.view(np.ndarray)\\n\\n    def naive_get_distance(points):\\n
      \       N = points.shape[0]\\n        distances = np.zeros(shape=(N,N))\\n        for
      i, A in enumerate(points):\\n            for j, B in enumerate(points):\\n                distances[i,j]
      = np.linalg.norm(A-B)\\n        return distances\\n\\n    def scipy_get_distance(points):\\n
      \       return scipy.spatial.distance.cdist(points,points)\\n\\nIf we score
      these functions in Jupyter, we can see that cdist is almost\\n2000 times faster
      than the pure Python function!\\n\\n    %%timeit\\n    naive_get_distance(points)\\n\\n

      \xB1 2.57 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\\n\\nIn
      this case, it's pretty obvious that we should just use cdist. But\\nwhat if
      there wasn't a magic built-in function for this task---how close\\ncan we get
      to the performance of cdist with other performance\\noptimizations?\\n\\nThe
      first and most obvious optimization is simply to take advantage of\\nthe symmetry
      of the matrix, and not compute entries below the diagonal.\\n(Note that this
      is sort of cheating, since cdist doesn't know that both\\narguments are the
      same.)\\n\\n    def triangle_get_distance(points):\\n        N = points.shape[0]\\n
      \       distances = np.zeros(shape=(N,N))\\n        for i in range(N):\\n            for

      \               distances[j,i] = distances[i,j]\\n        return distances\\n\\nAs
      expected, this roughly halves our time:\\n\\n    %%timeit\\n    triangle_get_distance(points)\\n\\n
      \   57.6 ms \xB1 409 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops
      each)\\n\\nNext, we can use Numba to compile this function. This yields roughly
      a\\n10-fold speedup, bringing us to about two orders of magnitude slower\\nthan
      cdist.\\n\\n    numba_triangle_get_distance = numba.njit(triangle_get_distance)\\n\\n

      36.2 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\\n\\nDefining
      our own norm with Numba, instead of using np.linalg.norm, gives\\nus another
      nice boost:\\n\\n    def custom_norm(AB):\\n        return np.sqrt(AB[0]*AB[0]
      + AB[1]*AB[1] + AB[2]*AB[2])\\n\\n    numba_custom_norm = numba.njit(custom_norm)\\n\\n

      21.6 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\\n\\nWhat
      about trying to write this program using only vectorized NumPy\\nfunctions?
      This takes a bit more creativity; I came up with the\\nfollowing function, which
      is a bit memory-inefficient but still runs\\nquite quickly:\\n\\n    def numpy_get_distance(points):\\n
      \       N = points.shape[0]\\n\\n        points_row = np.repeat(np.expand_dims(points,1),
      N, axis=1)\\n        points_col = np.repeat(np.expand_dims(points,0), N, axis=0)\\n\\n
      \       sq_diff = np.square(np.subtract(points_row, points_col))\\n        return
      np.sqrt(np.sum(sq_diff, axis=2))\\n\\n    %%timeit\\n    numpy_get_distance(points)\\n\\n
      \   426 \xB5s \xB1 6.34 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000
      loops each)\\n\\nUnfortunately, calling np.repeat with arguments [isn't supported
      by\\nNumba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html),\\nmeaning
      that I had to get a bit more creative to write a\\nNumba-compilable version
      of the previous program. The best solution that\\nI found involved a few array
      reshaping operations, which are\\n(presumably) pretty inefficient, and the final
      code only runs a little\\nbit faster than the Numpy-only version.\\n\\n    def
      numpy_get_distance2(points):\\n        N = points.shape[0]\\n\\n        points_row
      = np.swapaxes(points.repeat(N).reshape((N,3,N)),1,2)\\n        points_col =
      np.swapaxes(points_row,0,1)\\n\\n        sq_diff = np.square(np.subtract(points_row,
      points_col))\\n        return np.sqrt(np.sum(sq_diff, axis=2))\\n\\n    numba_np_get_distance2
      = numba.njit(numpy_get_distance2)\\n\\n    %%timeit\\n    numba_np_get_distance2(points)\\n\\n
      \   338 \xB5s \xB1 4.11 \xB5s per loop (mean \xB1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000
      loops each)\\n\\nI tried a few other approaches, but ultimately wasn't able
      to find\\nanything better; in theory, splitting the loops into chunks could\\nimprove
      cache utilization, but in practice anything clever I tried just\\nmade things
      slower.\\n\\nIn the end, we were able to accelerate our code about 250x by using
      a\\ncombination of NumPy and Numba, but were unable to match the speed of an\\noptimized
      low-level implementation. Maybe in a future post I'll drop\\ninto C or C++ and
      see how close I can get to the reference---until then,\\nI hope you found this
      useful.\\n\\n(I'm sure that there are ways that even this Python version could
      be\\nimproved; I did not even look at any other libraries, like Jax, Cython,\\nor
      PyPy. Let me know if you think of anything clever!)\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"114373962\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      at Irving Langmuir''s time at the General Electric Research\nLaboratory and
      how applied science can lead to advances in basic\nresearch.\n\nGilliam recounts
      how Langmuir started working on a question of\nincredible economic significance
      to GE---how to make lightbulbs last\nlonger without burning out---and after
      embarking on a years-long study\nof high-temperature metals under vacuum, not
      only managed to solve the\nlightbulb problem (by adding an inert gas to decrease
      evaporation and\ncoiling the filament to prevent heat loss), but also starting
      working on\nthe problems he would later become famous for studying. In [Langmuir''s\nown
      words](https://www.jstor.org/stable/16349):\n\n> The work with tungsten filaments
      and gases done prior to 1915 \\[at the\n> GE laboratory\\] had led me to recognize
      the importance of single\n> layers of atoms on the surface of tungsten filaments

      the only thing Langmuir studied at GE: he invented a\ngreatly improved form
      of vacuum pump, invented a hydrogen welding\nprocess used to construct vacuum-tight
      seals, and employed thin films of\nmolecules on water to determine accurate
      molecular sizes with\nunprecedented accuracy. Gilliam argues that this tremendous
      productivity\ncan in part be attributed to the fact that Langmuir''s work was
      in\nconstant contact with practical problems, which served as a source of\nscientific
      inspiration:\n\n> In a developed world that is not exactly beset by scarcity
      and\n> hardship anymore, it is hard to come up with the best areas to explore\n>
      out of thin air. Pain points are not often obvious. Fundamental\n> researchers
      can benefit massively from going to a lab mostly dedicated\n> to making practical
      improvements to things like light bulbs and pumps\n> and observing/asking questions.
      It is, frankly, odd that we normalized\n> a system in which so many of our fundamental
      STEM researchers are\n> allowed to grow so disjoint from the applied aspects
      of their field in\n> the first place.\n\nAnd [Langmuir himself](https://www.jstor.org/stable/16349)
      seems to\nagree:\n\n> As \\[the GE\\] laboratory developed it was soon recognized
      that it was\n> not practicable nor desirable that such a laboratory should be
      engaged\n> wholly in fundamental scientific research. It was found that at least\n>
      75 per cent of the laboratory must be devoted to the development of\n> the practical
      applications. It is stimulating to the men engaged in\n> fundamental science
      to be in contact with those primarily interested\n> in the practical applications.\n\nLet''s
      bring in our second thinker. Last weekend, I had the privilege of\nattending
      a lecture by Johnathan Bi on Rene Girard and the philosophy of\ninnovation,
      which discussed (among other things) how a desire for\n\"disruption\" above
      all else actually makes innovation more difficult. To\nquote Girard''s [\"Innovation
      and\nRepetition,\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3684663) which Bi discussed\nat
      length:\n\n> The main prerequisite for real innovation is a minimal respect
      for the\n> past and the mastery of its achievements, i.e., mimesis. To expect\n>
      novelty to cleanse itself of imitation is to expect a plant to grow\n> with
      its roots up in the air. In the long run, the obligation always\n> to rebel
      may be more destructive of novelty than the obligation never\n> to rebel.\n\nWhat
      does this mean? Girard is describing two ways in which innovation\ncan fail.
      The first is quite intuitive---if we hew to tradition too\nmuch, if we have
      an excessive respect for the past and not a \"minimal\nrespect,\" we''ll be
      afraid to innovate. This is the oft-derided state of\nstagnation.\n\nThe second
      way in which we can fail to innovate, however, is a bit more\nsubtle. Girard
      is saying that innovation also requires a mastery of the\npast''s achievements;
      we can''t simply ignore tradition, we have to\nunderstand what exists before
      we can innovate on top of it. Otherwise we\nwill be, in Girard''s words, like
      a plant \"with its roots up in the air.\"\nAll innovation has to occur within
      its proper context---to quote Tyler\nCowen, [\"context is that which is\nscarce.\"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html)\n\nThis
      might seem a little silly. Innovation, \"the introduction of new\nthings, ideas
      or ways of doing something\"\n([Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/innovation)),\nat
      first inspection seems not to depend on tradition at all. But novelty\nwith
      no hope of improvement over the status quo is simply a cry for\nattention; wearing
      one''s shoes on the wrong feet may be unusual, but is\nunlikely to win one renown
      as a great innovator.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa430d824-8068-4512-8030-22d53230649c_1196x364.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      to the post a few hours late,\nsorry.)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhat
      does this mean for scientific innovation, and how does this connect\nto Gilliam''s
      thoughts about Langmuir and the GE Research Laboratory? I''d\nargue that much
      of our fundamental research today, even that which is\nnovel, lacks the context
      necessary to be transformatively innovative.\nOften the most impactful discoveries
      aren''t those which self-consciously\naim to be *Science* or *Nature* papers,
      but those which simply aim to\naddress outstanding problems or investigate anomalies.
      For instance, our\nown lab''s interest in hydrogen-bond-donor organocatalysis
      [was\ninitiated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja980139y) by the\nunexpected
      discovery that omitting the metal from an ostensibly\nmetal-catalyzed Strecker
      reaction increased the enantioselectivity.\nGirard again:\n\n> The principle
      of originality at all costs leads to paralysis. The more\n> we celebrate \\\"creative
      and enriching\\\" innovations, the fewer of them\n> there are.\n\nLangmuir''s
      example shows us a different path towards innovation. If we\nset out to investigate
      and address real-world problems of known\npractical import, without innovation
      in mind, Gilliam and Girard argue\nthat we''ll be more innovative than if we
      make innovation our explicit\ngoal. I don''t have a concrete policy recommendation
      to share here, but\nsome of my other blog posts on [applied research at\nMIT](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220907_mit_elegy.html)\nand
      [the importance of\nengineering](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\nperhaps
      hint at what positive change might look like.\n\n*In accordance with the themes
      of this piece, my interpretation of\nGirard pretty much comes straight from
      Johnathan Bi. He has a lecture on\nYoutube where he discusses these ideas: [here''s
      a\nlink](https://youtu.be/qdWHcBBCaww?t=3906) to the relevant segment,\nwhich
      is the only part I''ve watched.*\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F218bf148-ab56-4aad-b9b6-bd577b81e4e7_995x1167.jpeg",

      in the GE Research Laboratory.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nNor were
      lightbulbs the only thing Langmuir studied at GE: he invented a\\ngreatly improved
      form of vacuum pump, invented a hydrogen welding\\nprocess used to construct
      vacuum-tight seals, and employed thin films of\\nmolecules on water to determine
      accurate molecular sizes with\\nunprecedented accuracy. Gilliam argues that
      this tremendous productivity\\ncan in part be attributed to the fact that Langmuir's
      work was in\\nconstant contact with practical problems, which served as a source
      of\\nscientific inspiration:\\n\\n> In a developed world that is not exactly
      beset by scarcity and\\n> hardship anymore, it is hard to come up with the best
      areas to explore\\n> out of thin air. Pain points are not often obvious. Fundamental\\n>
      researchers can benefit massively from going to a lab mostly dedicated\\n> to
      making practical improvements to things like light bulbs and pumps\\n> and observing/asking
      questions. It is, frankly, odd that we normalized\\n> a system in which so many
      of our fundamental STEM researchers are\\n> allowed to grow so disjoint from
      the applied aspects of their field in\\n> the first place.\\n\\nAnd [Langmuir
      himself](https://www.jstor.org/stable/16349) seems to\\nagree:\\n\\n> As \\\\[the
      GE\\\\] laboratory developed it was soon recognized that it was\\n> not practicable
      nor desirable that such a laboratory should be engaged\\n> wholly in fundamental
      scientific research. It was found that at least\\n> 75 per cent of the laboratory
      must be devoted to the development of\\n> the practical applications. It is
      stimulating to the men engaged in\\n> fundamental science to be in contact with
      those primarily interested\\n> in the practical applications.\\n\\nLet's bring
      in our second thinker. Last weekend, I had the privilege of\\nattending a lecture
      by Johnathan Bi on Rene Girard and the philosophy of\\ninnovation, which discussed
      (among other things) how a desire for\\n\\\"disruption\\\" above all else actually
      makes innovation more difficult. To\\nquote Girard's [\\\"Innovation and\\nRepetition,\\\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3684663)
      which Bi discussed\\nat length:\\n\\n> The main prerequisite for real innovation
      is a minimal respect for the\\n> past and the mastery of its achievements, i.e.,
      mimesis. To expect\\n> novelty to cleanse itself of imitation is to expect a
      plant to grow\\n> with its roots up in the air. In the long run, the obligation
      always\\n> to rebel may be more destructive of novelty than the obligation never\\n>
      to rebel.\\n\\nWhat does this mean? Girard is describing two ways in which innovation\\ncan
      fail. The first is quite intuitive---if we hew to tradition too\\nmuch, if we
      have an excessive respect for the past and not a \\\"minimal\\nrespect,\\\"
      we'll be afraid to innovate. This is the oft-derided state of\\nstagnation.\\n\\nThe
      second way in which we can fail to innovate, however, is a bit more\\nsubtle.
      Girard is saying that innovation also requires a mastery of the\\npast's achievements;
      we can't simply ignore tradition, we have to\\nunderstand what exists before
      we can innovate on top of it. Otherwise we\\nwill be, in Girard's words, like
      a plant \\\"with its roots up in the air.\\\"\\nAll innovation has to occur
      within its proper context---to quote Tyler\\nCowen, [\\\"context is that which
      is\\nscarce.\\\"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html)\\n\\nThis
      might seem a little silly. Innovation, \\\"the introduction of new\\nthings,

      innovation, devoid of context, becomes the highest\\nvirtue... (I added this
      to the post a few hours late,\\nsorry.)</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhat
      does this mean for scientific innovation, and how does this connect\\nto Gilliam's
      thoughts about Langmuir and the GE Research Laboratory? I'd\\nargue that much
      of our fundamental research today, even that which is\\nnovel, lacks the context
      necessary to be transformatively innovative.\\nOften the most impactful discoveries
      aren't those which self-consciously\\naim to be *Science* or *Nature* papers,
      but those which simply aim to\\naddress outstanding problems or investigate
      anomalies. For instance, our\\nown lab's interest in hydrogen-bond-donor organocatalysis
      [was\\ninitiated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja980139y) by the\\nunexpected
      discovery that omitting the metal from an ostensibly\\nmetal-catalyzed Strecker
      reaction increased the enantioselectivity.\\nGirard again:\\n\\n> The principle
      of originality at all costs leads to paralysis. The more\\n> we celebrate \\\\\\\"creative
      and enriching\\\\\\\" innovations, the fewer of them\\n> there are.\\n\\nLangmuir's
      example shows us a different path towards innovation. If we\\nset out to investigate
      and address real-world problems of known\\npractical import, without innovation
      in mind, Gilliam and Girard argue\\nthat we'll be more innovative than if we
      make innovation our explicit\\ngoal. I don't have a concrete policy recommendation
      to share here, but\\nsome of my other blog posts on [applied research at\\nMIT](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220907_mit_elegy.html)\\nand
      [the importance of\\nengineering](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\\nperhaps
      hint at what positive change might look like.\\n\\n*In accordance with the themes
      of this piece, my interpretation of\\nGirard pretty much comes straight from
      Johnathan Bi. He has a lecture on\\nYoutube where he discusses these ideas:
      [here's a\\nlink](https://youtu.be/qdWHcBBCaww?t=3906) to the relevant segment,\\nwhich
      is the only part I've watched.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"114373959\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      lightbulbs the only thing Langmuir studied at GE: he invented a\\ngreatly improved
      form of vacuum pump, invented a hydrogen welding\\nprocess used to construct
      vacuum-tight seals, and employed thin films of\\nmolecules on water to determine
      accurate molecular sizes with\\nunprecedented accuracy. Gilliam argues that
      this tremendous productivity\\ncan in part be attributed to the fact that Langmuir's
      work was in\\nconstant contact with practical problems, which served as a source
      of\\nscientific inspiration:\\n\\n> In a developed world that is not exactly
      beset by scarcity and\\n> hardship anymore, it is hard to come up with the best
      areas to explore\\n> out of thin air. Pain points are not often obvious. Fundamental\\n>
      researchers can benefit massively from going to a lab mostly dedicated\\n> to
      making practical improvements to things like light bulbs and pumps\\n> and observing/asking
      questions. It is, frankly, odd that we normalized\\n> a system in which so many
      of our fundamental STEM researchers are\\n> allowed to grow so disjoint from
      the applied aspects of their field in\\n> the first place.\\n\\nAnd [Langmuir
      himself](https://www.jstor.org/stable/16349) seems to\\nagree:\\n\\n> As \\\\[the
      GE\\\\] laboratory developed it was soon recognized that it was\\n> not practicable
      nor desirable that such a laboratory should be engaged\\n> wholly in fundamental
      scientific research. It was found that at least\\n> 75 per cent of the laboratory
      must be devoted to the development of\\n> the practical applications. It is
      stimulating to the men engaged in\\n> fundamental science to be in contact with
      those primarily interested\\n> in the practical applications.\\n\\nLet's bring
      in our second thinker. Last weekend, I had the privilege of\\nattending a lecture
      by Johnathan Bi on Rene Girard and the philosophy of\\ninnovation, which discussed
      (among other things) how a desire for\\n\\\"disruption\\\" above all else actually
      makes innovation more difficult. To\\nquote Girard's [\\\"Innovation and\\nRepetition,\\\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3684663)
      which Bi discussed\\nat length:\\n\\n> The main prerequisite for real innovation
      is a minimal respect for the\\n> past and the mastery of its achievements, i.e.,
      mimesis. To expect\\n> novelty to cleanse itself of imitation is to expect a
      plant to grow\\n> with its roots up in the air. In the long run, the obligation
      always\\n> to rebel may be more destructive of novelty than the obligation never\\n>
      to rebel.\\n\\nWhat does this mean? Girard is describing two ways in which innovation\\ncan
      fail. The first is quite intuitive---if we hew to tradition too\\nmuch, if we
      have an excessive respect for the past and not a \\\"minimal\\nrespect,\\\"
      we'll be afraid to innovate. This is the oft-derided state of\\nstagnation.\\n\\nThe
      second way in which we can fail to innovate, however, is a bit more\\nsubtle.
      Girard is saying that innovation also requires a mastery of the\\npast's achievements;
      we can't simply ignore tradition, we have to\\nunderstand what exists before
      we can innovate on top of it. Otherwise we\\nwill be, in Girard's words, like
      a plant \\\"with its roots up in the air.\\\"\\nAll innovation has to occur
      within its proper context---to quote Tyler\\nCowen, [\\\"context is that which
      is\\nscarce.\\\"](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/context-is-that-which-is-scarce-2.html)\\n\\nThis
      might seem a little silly. Innovation, \\\"the introduction of new\\nthings,
      ideas or ways of doing something\\\"\\n([Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/innovation)),\\nat
      first inspection seems not to depend on tradition at all. But novelty\\nwith
      no hope of improvement over the status quo is simply a cry for\\nattention;
      wearing one's shoes on the wrong feet may be unusual, but is\\nunlikely to win

      does this mean for scientific innovation, and how does this connect\\nto Gilliam's
      thoughts about Langmuir and the GE Research Laboratory? I'd\\nargue that much
      of our fundamental research today, even that which is\\nnovel, lacks the context
      necessary to be transformatively innovative.\\nOften the most impactful discoveries
      aren't those which self-consciously\\naim to be *Science* or *Nature* papers,
      but those which simply aim to\\naddress outstanding problems or investigate
      anomalies. For instance, our\\nown lab's interest in hydrogen-bond-donor organocatalysis
      [was\\ninitiated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja980139y) by the\\nunexpected
      discovery that omitting the metal from an ostensibly\\nmetal-catalyzed Strecker
      reaction increased the enantioselectivity.\\nGirard again:\\n\\n> The principle
      of originality at all costs leads to paralysis. The more\\n> we celebrate \\\\\\\"creative
      and enriching\\\\\\\" innovations, the fewer of them\\n> there are.\\n\\nLangmuir's
      example shows us a different path towards innovation. If we\\nset out to investigate
      and address real-world problems of known\\npractical import, without innovation
      in mind, Gilliam and Girard argue\\nthat we'll be more innovative than if we
      make innovation our explicit\\ngoal. I don't have a concrete policy recommendation
      to share here, but\\nsome of my other blog posts on [applied research at\\nMIT](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220907_mit_elegy.html)\\nand
      [the importance of\\nengineering](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20230215_science_engineering.html)\\nperhaps
      hint at what positive change might look like.\\n\\n*In accordance with the themes
      of this piece, my interpretation of\\nGirard pretty much comes straight from
      Johnathan Bi. He has a lecture on\\nYoutube where he discusses these ideas:

      about science, I find it helpful to divide computations\ninto two categories:
      models and oracles.\n\nIn this dichotomy, models are calculations which act
      like classic\nball-and-stick molecular models. They illustrate that something
      is\ngeometrically possible---that the atoms can literally be arranged in the\nproper
      orientation---but not much more. No alternative hypotheses have\nbeen ruled
      out, and no unexpected insights have emerged. A model has no\nintelligence of
      its own, and only reflects the thought that the user\nputs into it.\n\nThis
      isn''t bad! Perhaps the most striking example of the utility of\nmodels is [Tolman''s
      original cone angle\nreport](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00713a007),
      where he\nliterally made a wooden model of different phosphine ligands and\nmeasured
      the cone angle with a ruler.

      by Camille Miola (1880). Picture from\nWikimedia Commons.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nIn
      reality, every simulation is somewhere between these two limiting\nextremes.
      No matter how hard you try, a properly executed DFT\ncalculation will not predict
      formation of a methyl cation to be a\nlow-barrier process---the computational
      method used understands enough\nchemistry to rule this out, even if the user
      does not. On the flip side,\neven the most sophisticated calculations all involve
      some form of human\ninsight or intuition, either explicitly or implicitly. We''re
      still very\nfar away from the point where we can ask the computer to generate
      the\nstructures of new catalysts (or medicines) and expect reasonable,\ntrustworthy
      results. But that''s ok; there''s a lot to be gained from\nlesser calculations!
      There''s no shame in generating computational models\ninstead of oracles.\n\nWhat''s
      crucial, though, is to make sure that everyone---practitioners,\nexperimentalists,
      and readers---understands where a given calculation\nfalls on the model--oracle
      continuum. An expert might understand that a\nsemiempirical AIMD study of reaction
      dynamics is likely to be only\nqualitatively correct (if that), but does the
      casual reader? I''ve talked\nto an unfortunate number of experimental chemists
      who think a single DFT\npicture means that we can \"predict better catalysts,\"
      as if that were a\nbutton in GaussView. The appeal of oracles is seductive,
      and we have to\nbe clear when we''re presenting models instead. (This ties into
      [my piece\nabout computational\nnihilism.](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html))\n\nFinally,
      this piece would be incomplete if I didn''t highlight Jan Jensen\nand co-workers''
      [recent\nwork](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202218565) on\nautomated
      design of catalysts for the Morita--Baylis--Hillman reaction.\nThe authors use
      a generative model to discover tertiary amines with\nlower DFT-computed barriers
      than DABCO (the usual catalyst), and then\nexperimentally validate one of their
      candidates, finding that it is\nindeed almost an order-of-magnitude faster than
      DABCO. It''s difficult to\nunderscore how groundbreaking this result is; as
      the authors dryly note,\n\"We believe this is the first experimentally verified
      *de novo*\ndiscovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.\" On
      the\nspectrum discussed above, this is getting pretty close to \"oracle.\"\n\n:::

      the choice of model system illustrates how far the field\nstill has to go. The
      MBH reaction is among the best-studied reactions in\norganic chemistry, as illustrated
      by [Singleton''s 2015\nmechanistic](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      *[tour de\nforce](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)* (and references\ntherein,
      and subsequent work), so Jensen and co-workers could have good\nconfidence that
      the transition state they were studying was correct and\nrelevant. Furthermore,
      as I understand it, the MBH reaction can be\ncatalyzed by just about any tertiary
      amine---there aren''t the sort of\nharsh activity cliffs or arcane structural
      requirements that\ncharacterize many other catalytic reactions. Without either
      of these\nfactors---well-studied mechanism or friendly catalyst SAR---I doubt
      this\nwork would be possible.\n\nThis point might seem discouraging, but I mean
      it in quite the opposite\nway. *De novo* catalyst design isn''t impossible for
      mysterious and\nopaque reasons, but for quite intelligible reasons---mechanisms
      are\ncomplicated, catalysts are hard to design, and we just don''t understand\nenough
      about what we''re doing, experimentally or computationally. What\nJensen has
      shown us is that, if we can address these issues, we can\nexpect to start converging
      on oracular results. I find this very\nexciting!\n\n*Jan Jensen was kind enough

      Oracle</em>, by Camille Miola (1880). Picture from\\nWikimedia Commons.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn
      reality, every simulation is somewhere between these two limiting\\nextremes.
      No matter how hard you try, a properly executed DFT\\ncalculation will not predict
      formation of a methyl cation to be a\\nlow-barrier process---the computational
      method used understands enough\\nchemistry to rule this out, even if the user
      does not. On the flip side,\\neven the most sophisticated calculations all involve
      some form of human\\ninsight or intuition, either explicitly or implicitly.
      We're still very\\nfar away from the point where we can ask the computer to
      generate the\\nstructures of new catalysts (or medicines) and expect reasonable,\\ntrustworthy
      results. But that's ok; there's a lot to be gained from\\nlesser calculations!
      There's no shame in generating computational models\\ninstead of oracles.\\n\\nWhat's
      crucial, though, is to make sure that everyone---practitioners,\\nexperimentalists,
      and readers---understands where a given calculation\\nfalls on the model--oracle
      continuum. An expert might understand that a\\nsemiempirical AIMD study of reaction
      dynamics is likely to be only\\nqualitatively correct (if that), but does the
      casual reader? I've talked\\nto an unfortunate number of experimental chemists
      who think a single DFT\\npicture means that we can \\\"predict better catalysts,\\\"
      as if that were a\\nbutton in GaussView. The appeal of oracles is seductive,
      and we have to\\nbe clear when we're presenting models instead. (This ties into
      [my piece\\nabout computational\\nnihilism.](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html))\\n\\nFinally,
      this piece would be incomplete if I didn't highlight Jan Jensen\\nand co-workers'
      [recent\\nwork](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202218565)
      on\\nautomated design of catalysts for the Morita--Baylis--Hillman reaction.\\nThe
      authors use a generative model to discover tertiary amines with\\nlower DFT-computed
      barriers than DABCO (the usual catalyst), and then\\nexperimentally validate
      one of their candidates, finding that it is\\nindeed almost an order-of-magnitude
      faster than DABCO. It's difficult to\\nunderscore how groundbreaking this result
      is; as the authors dryly note,\\n\\\"We believe this is the first experimentally
      verified *de novo*\\ndiscovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.\\\"
      On the\\nspectrum discussed above, this is getting pretty close to \\\"oracle.\\\"\\n\\n:::

      3 from the paper, illustrating discovery of new\\ncatalysts.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nNevertheless,
      the choice of model system illustrates how far the field\\nstill has to go.
      The MBH reaction is among the best-studied reactions in\\norganic chemistry,
      as illustrated by [Singleton's 2015\\nmechanistic](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      *[tour de\\nforce](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)* (and references\\ntherein,
      and subsequent work), so Jensen and co-workers could have good\\nconfidence
      that the transition state they were studying was correct and\\nrelevant. Furthermore,
      as I understand it, the MBH reaction can be\\ncatalyzed by just about any tertiary
      amine---there aren't the sort of\\nharsh activity cliffs or arcane structural
      requirements that\\ncharacterize many other catalytic reactions. Without either
      of these\\nfactors---well-studied mechanism or friendly catalyst SAR---I doubt
      this\\nwork would be possible.\\n\\nThis point might seem discouraging, but
      I mean it in quite the opposite\\nway. *De novo* catalyst design isn't impossible
      for mysterious and\\nopaque reasons, but for quite intelligible reasons---mechanisms
      are\\ncomplicated, catalysts are hard to design, and we just don't understand\\nenough
      about what we're doing, experimentally or computationally. What\\nJensen has
      shown us is that, if we can address these issues, we can\\nexpect to start converging
      on oracular results. I find this very\\nexciting!\\n\\n*Jan Jensen was kind
      enough to [reply to this post on\\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/janhjensen/status/1628063110572507136)

      reality, every simulation is somewhere between these two limiting\\nextremes.
      No matter how hard you try, a properly executed DFT\\ncalculation will not predict
      formation of a methyl cation to be a\\nlow-barrier process---the computational
      method used understands enough\\nchemistry to rule this out, even if the user
      does not. On the flip side,\\neven the most sophisticated calculations all involve
      some form of human\\ninsight or intuition, either explicitly or implicitly.
      We're still very\\nfar away from the point where we can ask the computer to
      generate the\\nstructures of new catalysts (or medicines) and expect reasonable,\\ntrustworthy
      results. But that's ok; there's a lot to be gained from\\nlesser calculations!
      There's no shame in generating computational models\\ninstead of oracles.\\n\\nWhat's
      crucial, though, is to make sure that everyone---practitioners,\\nexperimentalists,
      and readers---understands where a given calculation\\nfalls on the model--oracle
      continuum. An expert might understand that a\\nsemiempirical AIMD study of reaction
      dynamics is likely to be only\\nqualitatively correct (if that), but does the
      casual reader? I've talked\\nto an unfortunate number of experimental chemists
      who think a single DFT\\npicture means that we can \\\"predict better catalysts,\\\"
      as if that were a\\nbutton in GaussView. The appeal of oracles is seductive,
      and we have to\\nbe clear when we're presenting models instead. (This ties into
      [my piece\\nabout computational\\nnihilism.](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220810_viewpoints_on_simulation.html))\\n\\nFinally,
      this piece would be incomplete if I didn't highlight Jan Jensen\\nand co-workers'
      [recent\\nwork](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202218565)
      on\\nautomated design of catalysts for the Morita--Baylis--Hillman reaction.\\nThe
      authors use a generative model to discover tertiary amines with\\nlower DFT-computed
      barriers than DABCO (the usual catalyst), and then\\nexperimentally validate
      one of their candidates, finding that it is\\nindeed almost an order-of-magnitude
      faster than DABCO. It's difficult to\\nunderscore how groundbreaking this result
      is; as the authors dryly note,\\n\\\"We believe this is the first experimentally
      verified *de novo*\\ndiscovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.\\\"
      On the\\nspectrum discussed above, this is getting pretty close to \\\"oracle.\\\"\\n\\n:::

      the choice of model system illustrates how far the field\\nstill has to go.
      The MBH reaction is among the best-studied reactions in\\norganic chemistry,
      as illustrated by [Singleton's 2015\\nmechanistic](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)
      *[tour de\\nforce](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja5111392)* (and references\\ntherein,
      and subsequent work), so Jensen and co-workers could have good\\nconfidence
      that the transition state they were studying was correct and\\nrelevant. Furthermore,
      as I understand it, the MBH reaction can be\\ncatalyzed by just about any tertiary
      amine---there aren't the sort of\\nharsh activity cliffs or arcane structural
      requirements that\\ncharacterize many other catalytic reactions. Without either
      of these\\nfactors---well-studied mechanism or friendly catalyst SAR---I doubt
      this\\nwork would be possible.\\n\\nThis point might seem discouraging, but
      I mean it in quite the opposite\\nway. *De novo* catalyst design isn't impossible
      for mysterious and\\nopaque reasons, but for quite intelligible reasons---mechanisms
      are\\ncomplicated, catalysts are hard to design, and we just don't understand\\nenough
      about what we're doing, experimentally or computationally. What\\nJensen has
      shown us is that, if we can address these issues, we can\\nexpect to start converging
      on oracular results. I find this very\\nexciting!\\n\\n*Jan Jensen was kind

      if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing\n> it. In engineering,
      if you do not know what you are doing, you should\n> not be doing it.*\n\n---Richard
      Hamming\n\nWhat''s the difference between science and engineering?\n\nFive years
      ago, I would have said something along the lines of\n\"engineers study known
      unknowns, scientists study unknown unknowns\"\n(with apologies to [Donald\nRumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns)),
      or\nmade a distinction between expanding the frontiers of knowledge\n(science)
      and settling already-explored territory (engineering).\n\nThese thoughts seem
      broadly consistent with what others think. Boston\nUniversity''s [College of\nEngineering](https://www.bu.edu/eng/about-eng/meet-the-dean/engineering-is-not-science/)\nsays:\n\n>
      Engineers are not a sub-category of scientists. So often the two terms\n> are
      used interchangeably, but they are separate, albeit related,\n> disciplines.
      Scientists explore the natural world and show us how and\n> why it is as it
      is. Discovery is the essence of science. Engineers\n> innovate solutions to
      real-world challenges in society. While it is\n> true that engineering without
      science could be haphazard; without\n> engineering, scientific discovery would
      be a merely an academic\n> pursuit.\n\nAnd the [National Society of Professional\nEngineers](https://www.nspe.org/resources/press-room/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-engineering)\nsays:\n\n>
      Science is knowledge based on observed facts and tested truths\n> arranged in
      an orderly system that can be validated and communicated\n> to other people.
      Engineering is the creative application of scientific\n> principles used to
      plan, build, direct, guide, manage, or work on\n> systems to maintain and improve
      our daily lives.\n\nAs I''ve started thinking more about the structure of the
      modern research\nsystem, and what its proper scope and purpose should be, I''ve
      grown\nincreasingly skeptical of these distinctions. The claim I want to make\nin
      this post is that, following the above definitions of engineering,\nmost chemistry
      is engineering. I don''t think this is bad! In fact, I\nthink that many chemists
      could benefit from borrowing from an\nengineering mindset, and should consider
      incorporating this perspective\nin their self-conception.\n\n## Much of Organic
      Chemistry is Engineering\n\nI want to return to the BU and NSPE definitions,
      because I think they''re\nconcise and well-written, and take as gospel that
      scientists \"explore\nthe natural world and show us how and why it is as it
      is,\" while\nengineers \"innovate solutions to real-world challenges in society\"\n(we''ll
      revisit issues of definition later). In short, developing\nsomething you want
      other people to use makes you an engineer. Which\nbranches of modern organic
      chemistry are science, and which are\nengineering?\n\nMethod development---one
      of my core interests---seems like a good\ncandidate for \"engineering.\" Researchers
      in this space identify unsolved\nproblems in organic synthesis, develop methods
      or catalysts to solve\nthese problems, and then (in many cases) advertise, license,
      & sell\ntheir solutions to consumers! (If you don''t believe me, just look at
      the\n[\"Organic Synthesis\"\ntab](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/collections/professor-product-portal)\nof
      the Sigma-Aldrich Professor Product Portal.) If these products\nweren''t molecules
      and were instead mechanical gadgets, nothing about\nthis would be obviously
      scientific.\n\nAnd the problems chosen are identified almost purely on the basis
      of\nwhat might be useful to potential users. There''s no clearer illustration\nof
      this than the recent gold rush to identify synthetic routes to\nbicyclic arene
      bioisosteres, which are useful in medicinal chemistry.\nFive years ago, I can''t
      think of a single paper making these compounds;\nnow, I can find nine in high-profile
      journals just from the past year or\nso ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05290-z.pdf),\n[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-00979-0.pdf),\n[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c09733),\n[4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c11501),\n[5](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.2c03498),\n[6](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c03681),\n[7](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03606),\n[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/anie.202205103),\n[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01135-y)).\n\nMechanistic
      and physical organic chemistry---another love of\nmine---present a tougher case,
      since in most cases the outcome of the\nstudies is only knowledge. But I''m
      still not sure that this makes this\nfield scientific! Let me illustrate why
      with an example.\n\nAn automotive engineer may be confused by why a given transmission
      is\nnot working. He/she may formulate a hypothesis, take the transmission\napart,
      perform various experiments on its constituent pieces, validate\nor disprove
      the initial hypothesis, and generally conduct a thorough\nmechanistic investigation
      to understand the origin of the problem. But\ndoes that make him/her a scientist?\n\nThe
      answer, I think, is no. The subject matter is not scientific, so no\namount
      of scientific thinking can make the work science. Similarly, I''d\nargue that
      investigating the mechanism of a system invented and\ndeveloped by humans---like
      a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling\nreaction---doesn''t count as science. (Does application
      of the scientific\nmethod automatically make one a scientist? See below for
      a continued\ndiscussion.)\n\nIn contrast, something that I think is a truly
      scientific area of\ninvestigation is the study of enzyme structure and function.
      Despite\nextensive study and many Nobel prizes, we''re still learning about
      how\nenzymes operate and how they achieve such extraordinary reactivity and\nselectivity.
      (For an example of this sort of work, see Arieh Warshel''s\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr0503106)
      on\nelectrostatic effects in enzyme catalysis, and references therein.)\n\nI
      don''t think I understand all areas of chemistry well enough to fairly\njudge
      whether they''re better understood as engineering or science, so\nI''ll leave
      this as an exercise to the reader: What motivates your\nresearch? Are you mainly
      driven by a desire to understand the natural\norder of things, or do you aim
      to develop technology to make the world\nbetter? Both are important, and neither
      answer is bad---but if your main\ngoal is inventing a new molecule, material,
      algorithm, or medicine, you\nmight consider thinking of yourself as more of
      an engineer than a\nscientist.\n\n## Do Different Definitions Clarify Matters?\n\nSince
      the claim that \"most chemistry is engineering\" is weird, we might\nconsider
      alternative definitions to solve this problem.\n\nOne appealing definition:
      \"a scientist is anyone who uses the scientific\nmethod.\" As I discussed above,
      in the case of the automotive engineer,\nlots of people use the scientific method
      who clearly aren''t scientists:\nengineers, yes, but also detectives, doctors,
      and many other people.\nIndeed, according to this definition almost anyone who
      acquires data to\nshed light on a problem is \"doing science.\" So I don''t
      think this is a\nvery good definition.\n\nAnother definition might be: \"if
      you''re closely involved with science,\nyou''re a scientist, even if the work
      you''re doing isn''t literally\npushing the frontiers of knowledge forward.\"
      I''m sympathetic to this\ndefinition, but I still find it hard to separate scientists
      and\nengineers here. What makes an engineer optimizing a new flow reactor\nless
      of a scientist than the chemist optimizing a new catalyst? Are they\nboth scientists?
      What about people who work on chip design and\nfabrication, or people who design
      analytical instruments, or people who\nuse them? I can''t find any clean way
      to divide scientists from engineers\nthat recapitulates the conventional usage
      of the terms.\n\n## Why Does This Matter?\n\nI think the root of this confusion
      is that the nature of scientific\nfields has changed over the past half-century.
      Organic chemistry hasn''t\nalways been largely engineering; a century ago, the
      structure of natural\nproducts and the nature of the chemical bond were mysteries,
      truly the\ndomain of science, and these issues were studied by chemists. As
      we''ve\ngrown to understand our field better and better, our work has shifted\nfrom
      science to engineering---the true mysteries in chemistry are now\nfew and far
      between, and the challenge facing today''s chemists is how to\nuse centuries
      of accumulated knowledge to better society. But because of\nour lineage, we
      think of ourselves as scientists, and have managed to\ndisguise the true nature
      of our work so well that we''ve deceived even\nourselves.\n\nBy this point,
      it should be obvious that I don''t think science is\nsuperior to engineering.
      In fact, I''m glad to work in an area that''s\nlargely engineering! But the
      way that an engineer ought to approach\ntheir work is different from the way
      a scientist ought to approach their\nwork. In writing this piece, I came across
      a 1996\n[article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/227234.227243) by Frederick\nBrooks,
      who argued that computer science was better understood as an\nengineering discipline
      and defended the importance of this claim:\n\n> If our discipline has been misnamed,
      so what? Surely computer science\n> is a harmless conceit. What''s in a name?
      Much. Our self-misnaming\n> hastens various unhappy trends.  \n>   \n> First,
      it implies that we accept a perceived pecking order that\n> respects natural
      scientists highly and engineers less so, and that we\n> seek to appropriate
      the higher station for ourselves. That is a\n> self-serving gambit, hence dubious....  \n>   \n>
      Second, sciences legitimately take the discovery of facts and laws as\n> a proper
      end in itself. A new fact, a new law is an accomplishment,\n> worthy of publication....
      But in design, in contrast with science,\n> novelty in itself has no merit.
      If we recognize our artifacts as\n> tools, we test them by their usefulness
      and their costs, not their\n> novelty.  \n>   \n> Third, we tend to forget our
      users and their real problems, climbing\n> into our ivory towers to dissect
      tractable abstractions of those\n> problems, abstractions that may have left
      behind the essence of the\n> real problem.\n\nI think Brooks''s summary is simple
      and elegant. If we judge the value of\nour work based on the utility of our
      tools, rather than the novelty of\nour ideas, we''ll spend our time on different
      problems and get excited\nabout different advances. There''s room for both scientists
      and engineers\nin chemistry---but at the margin, I think our field would benefit
      from\nbecoming less like science, and more like engineering.\n\n*Thanks to Michael

      grown\\nincreasingly skeptical of these distinctions. The claim I want to make\\nin
      this post is that, following the above definitions of engineering,\\nmost chemistry
      is engineering. I don't think this is bad! In fact, I\\nthink that many chemists
      could benefit from borrowing from an\\nengineering mindset, and should consider
      incorporating this perspective\\nin their self-conception.\\n\\n## Much of Organic
      Chemistry is Engineering\\n\\nI want to return to the BU and NSPE definitions,
      because I think they're\\nconcise and well-written, and take as gospel that
      scientists \\\"explore\\nthe natural world and show us how and why it is as
      it is,\\\" while\\nengineers \\\"innovate solutions to real-world challenges
      in society\\\"\\n(we'll revisit issues of definition later). In short, developing\\nsomething
      you want other people to use makes you an engineer. Which\\nbranches of modern
      organic chemistry are science, and which are\\nengineering?\\n\\nMethod development---one
      of my core interests---seems like a good\\ncandidate for \\\"engineering.\\\"
      Researchers in this space identify unsolved\\nproblems in organic synthesis,
      develop methods or catalysts to solve\\nthese problems, and then (in many cases)
      advertise, license, & sell\\ntheir solutions to consumers! (If you don't believe
      me, just look at the\\n[\\\"Organic Synthesis\\\"\\ntab](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/collections/professor-product-portal)\\nof
      the Sigma-Aldrich Professor Product Portal.) If these products\\nweren't molecules
      and were instead mechanical gadgets, nothing about\\nthis would be obviously
      scientific.\\n\\nAnd the problems chosen are identified almost purely on the
      basis of\\nwhat might be useful to potential users. There's no clearer illustration\\nof
      this than the recent gold rush to identify synthetic routes to\\nbicyclic arene
      bioisosteres, which are useful in medicinal chemistry.\\nFive years ago, I can't
      think of a single paper making these compounds;\\nnow, I can find nine in high-profile
      journals just from the past year or\\nso ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05290-z.pdf),\\n[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-00979-0.pdf),\\n[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c09733),\\n[4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c11501),\\n[5](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.2c03498),\\n[6](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c03681),\\n[7](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03606),\\n[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/anie.202205103),\\n[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01135-y)).\\n\\nMechanistic
      and physical organic chemistry---another love of\\nmine---present a tougher
      case, since in most cases the outcome of the\\nstudies is only knowledge. But
      I'm still not sure that this makes this\\nfield scientific! Let me illustrate
      why with an example.\\n\\nAn automotive engineer may be confused by why a given
      transmission is\\nnot working. He/she may formulate a hypothesis, take the transmission\\napart,
      perform various experiments on its constituent pieces, validate\\nor disprove
      the initial hypothesis, and generally conduct a thorough\\nmechanistic investigation
      to understand the origin of the problem. But\\ndoes that make him/her a scientist?\\n\\nThe
      answer, I think, is no. The subject matter is not scientific, so no\\namount
      of scientific thinking can make the work science. Similarly, I'd\\nargue that
      investigating the mechanism of a system invented and\\ndeveloped by humans---like
      a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling\\nreaction---doesn't count as science. (Does application
      of the scientific\\nmethod automatically make one a scientist? See below for
      a continued\\ndiscussion.)\\n\\nIn contrast, something that I think is a truly
      scientific area of\\ninvestigation is the study of enzyme structure and function.
      Despite\\nextensive study and many Nobel prizes, we're still learning about
      how\\nenzymes operate and how they achieve such extraordinary reactivity and\\nselectivity.
      (For an example of this sort of work, see Arieh Warshel's\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr0503106)
      on\\nelectrostatic effects in enzyme catalysis, and references therein.)\\n\\nI
      don't think I understand all areas of chemistry well enough to fairly\\njudge
      whether they're better understood as engineering or science, so\\nI'll leave
      this as an exercise to the reader: What motivates your\\nresearch? Are you mainly
      driven by a desire to understand the natural\\norder of things, or do you aim
      to develop technology to make the world\\nbetter? Both are important, and neither
      answer is bad---but if your main\\ngoal is inventing a new molecule, material,
      algorithm, or medicine, you\\nmight consider thinking of yourself as more of
      an engineer than a\\nscientist.\\n\\n## Do Different Definitions Clarify Matters?\\n\\nSince
      the claim that \\\"most chemistry is engineering\\\" is weird, we might\\nconsider
      alternative definitions to solve this problem.\\n\\nOne appealing definition:
      \\\"a scientist is anyone who uses the scientific\\nmethod.\\\" As I discussed
      above, in the case of the automotive engineer,\\nlots of people use the scientific
      method who clearly aren't scientists:\\nengineers, yes, but also detectives,
      doctors, and many other people.\\nIndeed, according to this definition almost
      anyone who acquires data to\\nshed light on a problem is \\\"doing science.\\\"
      So I don't think this is a\\nvery good definition.\\n\\nAnother definition might
      be: \\\"if you're closely involved with science,\\nyou're a scientist, even
      if the work you're doing isn't literally\\npushing the frontiers of knowledge
      forward.\\\" I'm sympathetic to this\\ndefinition, but I still find it hard
      to separate scientists and\\nengineers here. What makes an engineer optimizing
      a new flow reactor\\nless of a scientist than the chemist optimizing a new catalyst?
      Are they\\nboth scientists? What about people who work on chip design and\\nfabrication,
      or people who design analytical instruments, or people who\\nuse them? I can't
      find any clean way to divide scientists from engineers\\nthat recapitulates
      the conventional usage of the terms.\\n\\n## Why Does This Matter?\\n\\nI think
      the root of this confusion is that the nature of scientific\\nfields has changed

      in society\\\"\\n(we'll revisit issues of definition later). In short, developing\\nsomething
      you want other people to use makes you an engineer. Which\\nbranches of modern
      organic chemistry are science, and which are\\nengineering?\\n\\nMethod development---one
      of my core interests---seems like a good\\ncandidate for \\\"engineering.\\\"
      Researchers in this space identify unsolved\\nproblems in organic synthesis,
      develop methods or catalysts to solve\\nthese problems, and then (in many cases)
      advertise, license, & sell\\ntheir solutions to consumers! (If you don't believe
      me, just look at the\\n[\\\"Organic Synthesis\\\"\\ntab](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/collections/professor-product-portal)\\nof
      the Sigma-Aldrich Professor Product Portal.) If these products\\nweren't molecules
      and were instead mechanical gadgets, nothing about\\nthis would be obviously
      scientific.\\n\\nAnd the problems chosen are identified almost purely on the
      basis of\\nwhat might be useful to potential users. There's no clearer illustration\\nof
      this than the recent gold rush to identify synthetic routes to\\nbicyclic arene
      bioisosteres, which are useful in medicinal chemistry.\\nFive years ago, I can't
      think of a single paper making these compounds;\\nnow, I can find nine in high-profile
      journals just from the past year or\\nso ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05290-z.pdf),\\n[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-00979-0.pdf),\\n[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c09733),\\n[4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.2c11501),\\n[5](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.2c03498),\\n[6](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c03681),\\n[7](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c03606),\\n[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/anie.202205103),\\n[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01135-y)).\\n\\nMechanistic
      and physical organic chemistry---another love of\\nmine---present a tougher
      case, since in most cases the outcome of the\\nstudies is only knowledge. But
      I'm still not sure that this makes this\\nfield scientific! Let me illustrate
      why with an example.\\n\\nAn automotive engineer may be confused by why a given
      transmission is\\nnot working. He/she may formulate a hypothesis, take the transmission\\napart,
      perform various experiments on its constituent pieces, validate\\nor disprove
      the initial hypothesis, and generally conduct a thorough\\nmechanistic investigation
      to understand the origin of the problem. But\\ndoes that make him/her a scientist?\\n\\nThe
      answer, I think, is no. The subject matter is not scientific, so no\\namount
      of scientific thinking can make the work science. Similarly, I'd\\nargue that
      investigating the mechanism of a system invented and\\ndeveloped by humans---like
      a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling\\nreaction---doesn't count as science. (Does application
      of the scientific\\nmethod automatically make one a scientist? See below for
      a continued\\ndiscussion.)\\n\\nIn contrast, something that I think is a truly
      scientific area of\\ninvestigation is the study of enzyme structure and function.
      Despite\\nextensive study and many Nobel prizes, we're still learning about
      how\\nenzymes operate and how they achieve such extraordinary reactivity and\\nselectivity.
      (For an example of this sort of work, see Arieh Warshel's\\n[review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr0503106)
      on\\nelectrostatic effects in enzyme catalysis, and references therein.)\\n\\nI
      don't think I understand all areas of chemistry well enough to fairly\\njudge
      whether they're better understood as engineering or science, so\\nI'll leave
      this as an exercise to the reader: What motivates your\\nresearch? Are you mainly
      driven by a desire to understand the natural\\norder of things, or do you aim
      to develop technology to make the world\\nbetter? Both are important, and neither
      answer is bad---but if your main\\ngoal is inventing a new molecule, material,
      algorithm, or medicine, you\\nmight consider thinking of yourself as more of
      an engineer than a\\nscientist.\\n\\n## Do Different Definitions Clarify Matters?\\n\\nSince
      the claim that \\\"most chemistry is engineering\\\" is weird, we might\\nconsider
      alternative definitions to solve this problem.\\n\\nOne appealing definition:
      \\\"a scientist is anyone who uses the scientific\\nmethod.\\\" As I discussed
      above, in the case of the automotive engineer,\\nlots of people use the scientific
      method who clearly aren't scientists:\\nengineers, yes, but also detectives,
      doctors, and many other people.\\nIndeed, according to this definition almost
      anyone who acquires data to\\nshed light on a problem is \\\"doing science.\\\"
      So I don't think this is a\\nvery good definition.\\n\\nAnother definition might
      be: \\\"if you're closely involved with science,\\nyou're a scientist, even
      if the work you're doing isn't literally\\npushing the frontiers of knowledge
      forward.\\\" I'm sympathetic to this\\ndefinition, but I still find it hard
      to separate scientists and\\nengineers here. What makes an engineer optimizing
      a new flow reactor\\nless of a scientist than the chemist optimizing a new catalyst?
      Are they\\nboth scientists? What about people who work on chip design and\\nfabrication,
      or people who design analytical instruments, or people who\\nuse them? I can't
      find any clean way to divide scientists from engineers\\nthat recapitulates
      the conventional usage of the terms.\\n\\n## Why Does This Matter?\\n\\nI think
      the root of this confusion is that the nature of scientific\\nfields has changed
      over the past half-century. Organic chemistry hasn't\\nalways been largely engineering;
      a century ago, the structure of natural\\nproducts and the nature of the chemical
      bond were mysteries, truly the\\ndomain of science, and these issues were studied
      by chemists. As we've\\ngrown to understand our field better and better, our
      work has shifted\\nfrom science to engineering---the true mysteries in chemistry
      are now\\nfew and far between, and the challenge facing today's chemists is
      how to\\nuse centuries of accumulated knowledge to better society. But because
      of\\nour lineage, we think of ourselves as scientists, and have managed to\\ndisguise
      the true nature of our work so well that we've deceived even\\nourselves.\\n\\nBy
      this point, it should be obvious that I don't think science is\\nsuperior to
      engineering. In fact, I'm glad to work in an area that's\\nlargely engineering!
      But the way that an engineer ought to approach\\ntheir work is different from
      the way a scientist ought to approach their\\nwork. In writing this piece, I
      came across a 1996\\n[article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/227234.227243)
      by Frederick\\nBrooks, who argued that computer science was better understood
      as an\\nengineering discipline and defended the importance of this claim:\\n\\n>
      If our discipline has been misnamed, so what? Surely computer science\\n> is
      a harmless conceit. What's in a name? Much. Our self-misnaming\\n> hastens various
      unhappy trends.  \\n>   \\n> First, it implies that we accept a perceived pecking
      order that\\n> respects natural scientists highly and engineers less so, and
      that we\\n> seek to appropriate the higher station for ourselves. That is a\\n>
      self-serving gambit, hence dubious....  \\n>   \\n> Second, sciences legitimately
      take the discovery of facts and laws as\\n> a proper end in itself. A new fact,
      a new law is an accomplishment,\\n> worthy of publication.... But in design,
      in contrast with science,\\n> novelty in itself has no merit. If we recognize
      our artifacts as\\n> tools, we test them by their usefulness and their costs,
      not their\\n> novelty.  \\n>   \\n> Third, we tend to forget our users and their
      real problems, climbing\\n> into our ivory towers to dissect tractable abstractions
      of those\\n> problems, abstractions that may have left behind the essence of
      the\\n> real problem.\\n\\nI think Brooks's summary is simple and elegant. If
      we judge the value of\\nour work based on the utility of our tools, rather than
      the novelty of\\nour ideas, we'll spend our time on different problems and get
      excited\\nabout different advances. There's room for both scientists and engineers\\nin
      chemistry---but at the margin, I think our field would benefit from\\nbecoming
      less like science, and more like engineering.\\n\\n*Thanks to Michael Nielsen,
      Joe Gair, Ari Wagen, and Michael Tartre for\\nediting drafts of this post. Michael
      Tartre sent me the Richard Hamming\\nquote, and Phil Brooks sent me his grandfather's

      all Hartree--Fock-based computational methods, including\ndensity-functional
      theory, the rate-limiting step is calculating\nelectron--electron repulsion.
      (This isn''t true for semiempirical\nmethods, where matrix diagonalization is
      generally rate-limiting, or for\n[calculations on very large\nsystems](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00876).)\n\nWhen
      isolated single molecules are the subject of calculations (as\nopposed to solids
      or periodic systems), most programs describe\nelectronic structure in terms
      of atom-centered basis sets, which reduces\nthe electron--electron repulsion
      problem to one of calculating electron\nrepulsion integrals (ERIs) over quartets
      of basis shells. Framed this\nway, it becomes obvious why ERIs are the bottleneck:
      the number of ERIs\nwill scale as O(N^4^), meaning that millions of these integrals
      must be\ncalculated even for relatively small molecules.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92b68a56-3940-4bb8-9409-1ee8012acd48_1024x1024.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      tried to get DALL-E to make a visual representation of\nintegral screening;
      this was the best I got.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nOne big advance in
      electronic structure calculations was the development\nof integral screening
      techniques, the most popular of which is the\n\"Schwartz inequality\" (derived
      from the [Cauchy--Schwartz\ninequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality),\nbut
      actually developed by [Mario H\u00e4ser and Reinhart\nAhlrichs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540100111)\n\\[**EDIT:
      This is wrong, see correction at end!**\\]). If we denote an\nERI over shells
      A, B, C, and D as (AB\\|CD), then the Schwartz inequality\nsays:\n\n(AB\\|CD)
      \u2264 (AB\\|AB)^0.5^ (CD\\|CD)^0.5^\n\nThis is pretty intuitive: each shell
      pair will interact with itself\nmost, since it has perfect overlap with itself,
      and so the geometric\nmean of the interaction of each shell pair with itself
      is an upper bound\nfor the interaction between the two shell pairs. (Why would
      (AB\\|AB)\never be a small value? Well, A and B might be super far away from
      each\nother, and so the \"shell pair\" has very little overlap is just\nnegligible.)\n\nThis
      result is very useful. Since there are many fewer integrals of the\nform (AB\\|AB),
      we can start by calculating all of those, and then use\nthe resulting values
      to \"screen\" each shell quartet. If the predicted\nvalue is less than some
      predefined cutoff, the integral is skipped.\nWhile these screening methods don''t
      help much with small molecules,\nwhere all of the shells are pretty close to
      each other, they become\ncrucial for medium-sized molecules and above.\n\n(What''s
      the cutoff value? Orca defaults to 10^-8^,\n[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/integral/)
      to 10^-12^,\n[Psi4](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/autodir_options_c/module__scf.html)\nto
      10^-12^, and [QChem](https://manual.q-chem.com/5.2/Ch4.S3.SS2.html)\nto 10^-8^--10^-10^
      depending on the type of calculation.)\n\nThe Schwartz inequality neglects,
      however, another way in which (AB\\|CD)\nmight be very small: if (AB\\| and
      \\|CD) aren''t independently negligible,\nbut are just really far away from
      each other. One elegant way to address\nthis (out of many) comes from recent-ish
      work by [Travis Thompson and\nChristian Ochsenfeld](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994190).\nThey
      define an intermediate quantity M for each pair of shells, derived\nfrom different
      high-symmetry integrals:\n\nM~AC~ := (AA\\|CC) / ( (AA\\|AA)^0.5^ (CC\\|CC)^0.5^
      )\n\nM~AC~ intuitively represents the distance between the two shells, and is\nguaranteed
      to be in the range \\[0,1\\]. Thompson and Ochsenfeld then use\nthis quantity
      to propose an estimate of a shell quartet''s value:\n\n(AB\\|CD) \u2248 (AB\\|AB)^0.5^
      (CD\\|CD)^0.5^ max(M~AC~M~BD~, M~AD~M~BC~)\n\nThis is no longer a rigorous upper
      bound like the Schwartz inequality,\nbut it''s a pretty good estimate of the
      size of the integral.\n\nHow much of a difference does this make in practice?
      To test this, I ran\nHF/STO-3G calculations on dodecane in the fully linear
      configuration. As\nshown by [Alml\u00f6f, Faegri, and\nKorsell](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314),\nlinear
      molecules benefit the most from integral screening (since the\nshells are on
      average farther apart), so I hoped to see a sizable effect\nwithout having to
      study particularly large molecules.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefda01b9-66c0-43a7-a315-d5c061da73a3_798x718.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      CSAM and QQ.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nA few things are apparent for this
      data. First, even tight thresholds\nlead to dramatic speedups relative to the
      unscreened calculation---and\nwith minimal errors. Secondly, the CSAM bound
      really does work better\nthan the QQ bound (especially if you ignore the high-error
      10^-9^\nthreshold data point). For most threshold values, using CSAM leads to\nabout
      a 20% increase in speed, at the cost of a 3-fold increase in an\nalready small
      error. Viewed visually, we can see that the Pareto\nfrontier for CSAM (blue)
      is just closer to the optimal bottom-left\ncorner than the corresponding frontier
      for QQ (black).\n\nI hope this post serves to explain some of the magic that
      goes on behind\nthe scenes to make \"routine\" QM calculations possible. (If
      you thought\nthese tricks were sneaky, wait until you hear how the integrals
      that\naren''t screened out are calculated!)\n\n***CORRECTION**: In this post,
      I credited Mario H\u00e4ser and Reinhart\nAhlrichs with developing the Cauchy--Schwartz
      method for integral\nscreening. A (famous) theoretical chemist who shall remain
      nameless\nreached out to me to correct the record---in fact, Alml\u00f6f included
      an\noverlap-based screening method in [his landmark 1982\npaper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314).
      To\nthe untrained eye, this appears unrelated to ERI-based screening, but we\nare
      using Gaussian basis sets and so \"one can therefore write the\nintegrals in
      terms of overlaps,\" meaning that what looked like a\ndifferent expression is
      actually the same thing. (Section 9.12 of\nHelgaker/Jorgensen/Olsen\\''s textbook*
      Molecular Electronic Structure\nTheory*, a book I sadly do not own, apparently
      discusses this more.)*\n\n*The professor traced this back to [Wilhite and\nEumena](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1681647?journalCode=jcp)\nin
      1974, and ultimately back to the work of Witten in the 1960s. It is a\npleasure
      to get corrected by those you respect, and I welcome any\nreaders who find errors
      in my writing to reach out; I will do my best to\nrespond and take blame as
      appropriate.*\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92b68a56-3940-4bb8-9409-1ee8012acd48_1024x1024.png",

      tried to get DALL-E to make a visual representation of\\nintegral screening;
      this was the best I got.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nOne big advance
      in electronic structure calculations was the development\\nof integral screening
      techniques, the most popular of which is the\\n\\\"Schwartz inequality\\\" (derived
      from the [Cauchy--Schwartz\\ninequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality),\\nbut
      actually developed by [Mario H\xE4ser and Reinhart\\nAhlrichs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540100111)\\n\\\\[**EDIT:
      This is wrong, see correction at end!**\\\\]). If we denote an\\nERI over shells
      A, B, C, and D as (AB\\\\|CD), then the Schwartz inequality\\nsays:\\n\\n(AB\\\\|CD)
      \u2264 (AB\\\\|AB)^0.5^ (CD\\\\|CD)^0.5^\\n\\nThis is pretty intuitive: each
      shell pair will interact with itself\\nmost, since it has perfect overlap with
      itself, and so the geometric\\nmean of the interaction of each shell pair with
      itself is an upper bound\\nfor the interaction between the two shell pairs.
      (Why would (AB\\\\|AB)\\never be a small value? Well, A and B might be super
      far away from each\\nother, and so the \\\"shell pair\\\" has very little overlap
      is just\\nnegligible.)\\n\\nThis result is very useful. Since there are many
      fewer integrals of the\\nform (AB\\\\|AB), we can start by calculating all of
      those, and then use\\nthe resulting values to \\\"screen\\\" each shell quartet.
      If the predicted\\nvalue is less than some predefined cutoff, the integral is
      skipped.\\nWhile these screening methods don't help much with small molecules,\\nwhere
      all of the shells are pretty close to each other, they become\\ncrucial for
      medium-sized molecules and above.\\n\\n(What's the cutoff value? Orca defaults
      to 10^-8^,\\n[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/integral/) to 10^-12^,\\n[Psi4](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/autodir_options_c/module__scf.html)\\nto
      10^-12^, and [QChem](https://manual.q-chem.com/5.2/Ch4.S3.SS2.html)\\nto 10^-8^--10^-10^
      depending on the type of calculation.)\\n\\nThe Schwartz inequality neglects,
      however, another way in which (AB\\\\|CD)\\nmight be very small: if (AB\\\\|
      and \\\\|CD) aren't independently negligible,\\nbut are just really far away
      from each other. One elegant way to address\\nthis (out of many) comes from
      recent-ish work by [Travis Thompson and\\nChristian Ochsenfeld](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994190).\\nThey
      define an intermediate quantity M for each pair of shells, derived\\nfrom different
      high-symmetry integrals:\\n\\nM~AC~ := (AA\\\\|CC) / ( (AA\\\\|AA)^0.5^ (CC\\\\|CC)^0.5^
      )\\n\\nM~AC~ intuitively represents the distance between the two shells, and
      is\\nguaranteed to be in the range \\\\[0,1\\\\]. Thompson and Ochsenfeld then
      use\\nthis quantity to propose an estimate of a shell quartet's value:\\n\\n(AB\\\\|CD)
      \u2248 (AB\\\\|AB)^0.5^ (CD\\\\|CD)^0.5^ max(M~AC~M~BD~, M~AD~M~BC~)\\n\\nThis
      is no longer a rigorous upper bound like the Schwartz inequality,\\nbut it's
      a pretty good estimate of the size of the integral.\\n\\nHow much of a difference
      does this make in practice? To test this, I ran\\nHF/STO-3G calculations on
      dodecane in the fully linear configuration. As\\nshown by [Alml\xF6f, Faegri,
      and\\nKorsell](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314),\\nlinear
      molecules benefit the most from integral screening (since the\\nshells are on
      average farther apart), so I hoped to see a sizable effect\\nwithout having
      to study particularly large molecules.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefda01b9-66c0-43a7-a315-d5c061da73a3_798x718.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      CSAM and QQ.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nA few things are apparent for
      this data. First, even tight thresholds\\nlead to dramatic speedups relative
      to the unscreened calculation---and\\nwith minimal errors. Secondly, the CSAM
      bound really does work better\\nthan the QQ bound (especially if you ignore
      the high-error 10^-9^\\nthreshold data point). For most threshold values, using
      CSAM leads to\\nabout a 20% increase in speed, at the cost of a 3-fold increase
      in an\\nalready small error. Viewed visually, we can see that the Pareto\\nfrontier
      for CSAM (blue) is just closer to the optimal bottom-left\\ncorner than the
      corresponding frontier for QQ (black).\\n\\nI hope this post serves to explain
      some of the magic that goes on behind\\nthe scenes to make \\\"routine\\\" QM
      calculations possible. (If you thought\\nthese tricks were sneaky, wait until
      you hear how the integrals that\\naren't screened out are calculated!)\\n\\n***CORRECTION**:
      In this post, I credited Mario H\xE4ser and Reinhart\\nAhlrichs with developing
      the Cauchy--Schwartz method for integral\\nscreening. A (famous) theoretical
      chemist who shall remain nameless\\nreached out to me to correct the record---in
      fact, Alml\xF6f included an\\noverlap-based screening method in [his landmark
      1982\\npaper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314). To\\nthe
      untrained eye, this appears unrelated to ERI-based screening, but we\\nare using
      Gaussian basis sets and so \\\"one can therefore write the\\nintegrals in terms
      of overlaps,\\\" meaning that what looked like a\\ndifferent expression is actually
      the same thing. (Section 9.12 of\\nHelgaker/Jorgensen/Olsen\\\\'s textbook*
      Molecular Electronic Structure\\nTheory*, a book I sadly do not own, apparently
      discusses this more.)*\\n\\n*The professor traced this back to [Wilhite and\\nEumena](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1681647?journalCode=jcp)\\nin
      1974, and ultimately back to the work of Witten in the 1960s. It is a\\npleasure
      to get corrected by those you respect, and I welcome any\\nreaders who find
      errors in my writing to reach out; I will do my best to\\nrespond and take blame
      as appropriate.*\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"114373971\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      tried to get DALL-E to make a visual representation of\\nintegral screening;
      this was the best I got.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nOne big advance
      in electronic structure calculations was the development\\nof integral screening
      techniques, the most popular of which is the\\n\\\"Schwartz inequality\\\" (derived
      from the [Cauchy--Schwartz\\ninequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality),\\nbut
      actually developed by [Mario H\xE4ser and Reinhart\\nAhlrichs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540100111)\\n\\\\[**EDIT:
      This is wrong, see correction at end!**\\\\]). If we denote an\\nERI over shells
      A, B, C, and D as (AB\\\\|CD), then the Schwartz inequality\\nsays:\\n\\n(AB\\\\|CD)
      \u2264 (AB\\\\|AB)^0.5^ (CD\\\\|CD)^0.5^\\n\\nThis is pretty intuitive: each
      shell pair will interact with itself\\nmost, since it has perfect overlap with
      itself, and so the geometric\\nmean of the interaction of each shell pair with
      itself is an upper bound\\nfor the interaction between the two shell pairs.
      (Why would (AB\\\\|AB)\\never be a small value? Well, A and B might be super
      far away from each\\nother, and so the \\\"shell pair\\\" has very little overlap
      is just\\nnegligible.)\\n\\nThis result is very useful. Since there are many
      fewer integrals of the\\nform (AB\\\\|AB), we can start by calculating all of
      those, and then use\\nthe resulting values to \\\"screen\\\" each shell quartet.
      If the predicted\\nvalue is less than some predefined cutoff, the integral is
      skipped.\\nWhile these screening methods don't help much with small molecules,\\nwhere
      all of the shells are pretty close to each other, they become\\ncrucial for
      medium-sized molecules and above.\\n\\n(What's the cutoff value? Orca defaults
      to 10^-8^,\\n[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/integral/) to 10^-12^,\\n[Psi4](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/autodir_options_c/module__scf.html)\\nto
      10^-12^, and [QChem](https://manual.q-chem.com/5.2/Ch4.S3.SS2.html)\\nto 10^-8^--10^-10^
      depending on the type of calculation.)\\n\\nThe Schwartz inequality neglects,
      however, another way in which (AB\\\\|CD)\\nmight be very small: if (AB\\\\|
      and \\\\|CD) aren't independently negligible,\\nbut are just really far away
      from each other. One elegant way to address\\nthis (out of many) comes from
      recent-ish work by [Travis Thompson and\\nChristian Ochsenfeld](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4994190).\\nThey
      define an intermediate quantity M for each pair of shells, derived\\nfrom different
      high-symmetry integrals:\\n\\nM~AC~ := (AA\\\\|CC) / ( (AA\\\\|AA)^0.5^ (CC\\\\|CC)^0.5^
      )\\n\\nM~AC~ intuitively represents the distance between the two shells, and
      is\\nguaranteed to be in the range \\\\[0,1\\\\]. Thompson and Ochsenfeld then
      use\\nthis quantity to propose an estimate of a shell quartet's value:\\n\\n(AB\\\\|CD)
      \u2248 (AB\\\\|AB)^0.5^ (CD\\\\|CD)^0.5^ max(M~AC~M~BD~, M~AD~M~BC~)\\n\\nThis
      is no longer a rigorous upper bound like the Schwartz inequality,\\nbut it's
      a pretty good estimate of the size of the integral.\\n\\nHow much of a difference
      does this make in practice? To test this, I ran\\nHF/STO-3G calculations on
      dodecane in the fully linear configuration. As\\nshown by [Alml\xF6f, Faegri,
      and\\nKorsell](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314),\\nlinear
      molecules benefit the most from integral screening (since the\\nshells are on
      average farther apart), so I hoped to see a sizable effect\\nwithout having
      to study particularly large molecules.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefda01b9-66c0-43a7-a315-d5c061da73a3_798x718.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      this data. First, even tight thresholds\\nlead to dramatic speedups relative
      to the unscreened calculation---and\\nwith minimal errors. Secondly, the CSAM
      bound really does work better\\nthan the QQ bound (especially if you ignore
      the high-error 10^-9^\\nthreshold data point). For most threshold values, using
      CSAM leads to\\nabout a 20% increase in speed, at the cost of a 3-fold increase
      in an\\nalready small error. Viewed visually, we can see that the Pareto\\nfrontier
      for CSAM (blue) is just closer to the optimal bottom-left\\ncorner than the
      corresponding frontier for QQ (black).\\n\\nI hope this post serves to explain
      some of the magic that goes on behind\\nthe scenes to make \\\"routine\\\" QM
      calculations possible. (If you thought\\nthese tricks were sneaky, wait until
      you hear how the integrals that\\naren't screened out are calculated!)\\n\\n***CORRECTION**:
      In this post, I credited Mario H\xE4ser and Reinhart\\nAhlrichs with developing
      the Cauchy--Schwartz method for integral\\nscreening. A (famous) theoretical
      chemist who shall remain nameless\\nreached out to me to correct the record---in
      fact, Alml\xF6f included an\\noverlap-based screening method in [his landmark
      1982\\npaper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.540030314). To\\nthe
      untrained eye, this appears unrelated to ERI-based screening, but we\\nare using

      has long been a focus of research in computer science,\nwhere new optimization
      algorithms can have an incredibly high impact\n(e.g. [ADAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf),
      one of the most\ncommonly used optimizers for neural network training). More
      recently,\nthe advent of directed evolution has made optimization methods a
      central\nfocus of biocatalysis, since (in many cases) the efficacy of the\nreaction
      one discovers is primarily dependent on the efficacy of the\noptimization method
      used.\n\nIn contrast, it seems that meta-optimization has historically attracted\nless
      attention from \"classic\" organic chemists, despite the central\nimportance
      of reaction optimization to so much of what we do. This post\naims to show some
      of the ways in which this paradigm is changing, and\nbriefly summarize some
      of what I consider to be the most interesting and\nexciting recent advances
      in chemical meta-optimization. *(This is a big\nand somewhat nebulous area,
      and I am certainly leaving things out or not\npaying due homage to everyone.
      Sorry in advance!)*\n\n### Design of Experiments, and Dealing with Discrete
      Variables\n\nPerhaps the best-known optimization algorithm in chemistry is \"design
      of\nexperiments\" (DoE), which uses statistical methods to estimate the shape\nof
      a multiparameter surface and find minima or maxima more efficiently\nthan one-factor-at-a-time
      screening. (DoE is a pretty broad term that\ngets used to describe a lot of
      different techniques: for more reading,\n[see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_surface_methodology)\n[these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_composite_design)\n[links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Behnken_design).)\n\nDoE
      has been used for a long time, [especially in process\nchemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/op500169m),
      and is very\neffective at optimizing continuous variables (like temperature,\nconcentration,
      and equivalents). However, it''s less obvious how DoE\nmight be extended to
      discrete variables. ([This 2010\nreport](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ol1020898),
      from scientists\nat Eli Lilly, reports the use of DoE to optimize a palladium-catalyzed\npyrazole
      arylation, but without many details about the statistical\nmethods used.)\n\n[A
      nice paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/op300275p) from Jonathan\nMoseley
      and co-workers illustrates why discrete variables are so tricky:\n\n> How does
      one compare such different solvents as hexane and DMSO for\n> example? Comparing
      their relative polarities, which is often related\n> to solubility, might be
      one way, but this may not be the most\n> important factor for the reaction in
      question. Additionally, this\n> simple trend may not be relevant in any case,
      given for example that\n> chlorinated solvents have good solubilising power
      despite their\n> low-to-medium polarity (as judged by their dielectric constant).
      On\n> the other hand, the high polarity and solubilising power of alcohols\n>
      might be compromised in the desired reaction by their protic nature,\n> whilst
      the \"unrelated\" hexane and DMSO are both aprotic.  \n>   \n> In summary, replacing
      any one of the discrete parameters with another\n> does not yield a different
      value on the same axis of a graph, as it\n> would for a continuous parameter;
      instead it requires a different\n> graph with different axes which may have
      no meaningful relationship to\n> the first one whatsoever. This means that every
      single combination of\n> catalyst/ligand/base/solvent is essentially a different
      reaction for\n> the same two starting materials to produce the same product.\n>
      *(emphasis added)*\n\nThe solution the authors propose is to use principal component
      analysis\n(PCA) on molecular descriptors, such as \"measurable physical factors\n(e.g.,
      bp, density, bond length), or calculated and theoretical ones\n(e.g., electron
      density, Hansen solubility parameters, Kamlet--Taft\nsolvent polarity parameters),\"
      to convert discrete parameters into\ncontinuous ones. This general approach
      for handling discrete\nvariables---generation of continuous molecular descriptors,
      followed by\nuse of a dimensionality reduction algorithm---is widely used today
      for\nlots of tasks (see for instance [this\npaper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ob/c5ob01892g)\non
      DoE for solvent screening, and [my previous post on\nUMAP](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220926_plotting_diversity.html)).\n\n###
      Choosing Intelligent Screening Sets\n\nWith continuous descriptors for formally
      discrete variables in hand, a\nnatural next step is to use this data to choose
      catalyst/substrates that\nbest cover chemical space. (This can be done with
      several algorithms;\nsee [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm9700878?ref=PDF)
      for\nmore discussion) In 2016, this technique was popularized by the Merck\n[\"informer\nlibrary\"](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/sc/c5sc04751j)\napproach,
      which generated sets of aryl boronic esters and aryl halides\nthat could be
      used to fairly evaluate new reactions against complex,\ndrug-like substrates.

      of the Merck informer library (yellow) in\nchemical space, compared to drugs
      (grey) and compounds from recent\nliterature (blue).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWhile
      the Merck informer libraries were intended to be shared and used\nby lots of
      research groups, recently it''s become more common for\nindividual research
      groups to design their own project-specific\nscreening sets. Abbie Doyle and
      co-workers [kicked this\noff](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)
      in 2022 by using\nDFT-based descriptors, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and
      agglomerative\nhierarchical clustering to generate a maximally diverse set of\ncommercial
      aryl bromides. Other groups soon followed suit: [Karl\nGademann](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01813)
      used this\napproach to study bromotetrazine cross coupling, while Marion Emmert
      and\nco-workers at Merck [employed similar\nmethods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c10557)
      to\ninvestigate azole carboxylation. (I''ve also used this approach for\nsubstrate
      selection!)\n\nThis approach can also be used to design intelligent sets of\ncatalysts/ligands
      at the outset of a screening project. Using [their\n\"kraken\" dataset of phosphine\nproperties](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c09718),
      Tobias\nGensch and Matt Sigman [proposed a set of 32 commercially available\nligands](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01970)
      which aims\nto cover as much of phosphine chemical space as possible in an initial\nscreen.
      Jason Stevens and co-workers combined this idea with the\nsubstrate-selection
      methods from the previous paragraph to [perform a\ndetailed study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.2c00089)\nof
      Ni-catalyzed borylation under many conditions, and tested a variety\nof ML models
      on the resulting dataset. (Scott Denmark and co-workers\nhave also used a variant
      of this idea, called the Universal Training\nSet, to [initialize ML-driven reaction\noptimization](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5631).)\n\n###
      New Optimization Algorithms\n\nAs in every area of life, ML-based approaches
      have been used a lot for\noptimization recently. This isn''t new; Klaus Jensen
      and Steve Buchwald\n[used machine\nlearning](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/RE/C6RE00153J)\nto
      drive autonomous optimization in 2016, and [Richard\nZare](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492)
      published a\ndetailed methodological study in 2017. Nevertheless, as with\ncomputational
      substrate selection, these techniques have come into the\nmainstream in the
      past few years.\n\nI mentioned the work of Scott Denmark on ML-driven optimization
      before,\nand his team published two more papers on this topic last year: [one
      on\natropselective biaryl\niodination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08820),
      and [one on\noptimization of](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)\n*[Cinchona](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)*\n[alkaloid-based
      phase transfer\ncatalysts](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155).
      In\nparticular, the second paper (conducted in collaboration with scientists\nat
      Merck) illustrates how an ML model can be updated with new data as\noptimization
      progresses, allowing many sequential rounds of catalyst\ndevelopment to be conducted.\n\nAbbie
      Doyle''s group has done a lot of work on using [Bayesian\noptimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)
      (BO)\nto drive reaction optimization. [Their first\npaper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03213-y)
      in this area\nillustrated the capacity of BO to avoid spurious local minima,
      and went\non to validate this approach in a variety of complex problems. Even\nbetter,
      they compared the results of BO to chemist-guided optimization\nto see if computer-driven
      optimization could outcompete expert\nintuition. To quote the paper:\n\n> In
      total, 50 expert chemists and engineers from academia and industry\n> played
      the reaction optimization game (Fig. 4c). Accordingly, the\n> Bayesian reaction
      optimizer also played the game 50 times (Fig. 4b),\n> each time starting with
      a different random initialization. The first\n> point of comparison between
      human participants and the machine\n> learning optimizer was their raw maximum
      observed yield at each step\n> during the optimization. Humans made significantly
      (*p* \\< 0.05)\n> better initial choices than random selection, on average discovering\n>
      conditions that had 15% higher yield in their first batch of\n> experiments.
      However, even with random initialization, within three\n> batches of five experiments
      the average performance of the optimizer\n> surpassed that of the humans. Notably,
      in contrast to human\n> participants, Bayesian optimization achieved \\>99%
      yield 100% of the\n> time within the experimental budget. Moreover, Bayesian
      optimization\n> tended to discover globally optimal conditions (CgMe-PPh, CsOPiv
      or\n> CsOAc, DMAc, 0.153 M, 105\u2009\u00b0C) within the first 50 experiments
      (Fig.\n> 4b). *(emphasis added)*\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b96de0-41b9-4149-99a5-3cc1b47b32ac_634x680.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      ML model (i.e., new\nreactions are chosen based on the regions of chemical space
      that the\nalgorithm has the least knowledge about; this is similar to, but\ndistinct
      from, Bayesian optimization). This is a pretty interesting\napproach, and I
      hope they study it further in the future. (Aspuru-Guzik\nhas done [lots of other
      work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03716) in this\narea, including some [Bayesian\noptimization](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307).)\n\nFinally,
      two papers this year (that I''m aware of) put forward the idea\nof using multi-substrate
      loss functions for optimization: [our work on\nscreening for\ngenerality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05263-2)
      and [a\nbeautiful\ncollaboration](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/636a84ab80c9bf01cc8d95f9)\nfrom
      Song Lin, Scott Miller, and Matt Sigman. These papers used\n\"low-tech\" optimization
      methods that are familiar to practicing organic\nchemists (e.g. \"screen different
      groups at this position\"), but\nevaluated the output of this optimization not
      based on the\nyield/enantioselectivity of a single substrate but on aggregate
      metrics\nderived from many substrates. The results that our groups were able
      to\nuncover were good, but I''m sure adding robotics and advanced ML\noptimization
      will turbocharge this concept and find new and better\ncatalysts with truly
      remarkable generality.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nReaction optimization is a common
      task in organic chemistry, but one\nthat''s commonly done without much metacognition.
      Instead, many\nresearchers will screen catalysts, substrates, and conditions
      based on\nhabit or convenience, without necessarily dwelling on whether their\nscreening
      procedure is optimal. While this may work well enough when you\nonly need to
      optimize one or two reactions in your whole graduate school\ncareer (or when
      acquiring each data point takes days or weeks), *ad hoc*\nstrategies will at
      some point simply fail to scale.\n\nOrganic chemistry, long the realm of \"small
      data,\" is slowly but\ninexorably catching up with the adjacent sciences. As
      progress in lab\nautomation and instrumentation makes setting up, purifying,
      and\nanalyzing large numbers of reactions easier, experimental chemists will\nhave
      to figure out how to choose which reactions to run and how to\nhandle all the
      data from these reactions, using tools like the ones\ndiscussed above. Like
      it or not, data science and cheminformatics may\nsoon become core competencies
      of the modern experimental chemist!\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff14e99-c106-4480-be19-8b08f8f31ba8_555x450.png",

      has long been a focus of research in computer science,\\nwhere new optimization
      algorithms can have an incredibly high impact\\n(e.g. [ADAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf),
      one of the most\\ncommonly used optimizers for neural network training). More
      recently,\\nthe advent of directed evolution has made optimization methods a
      central\\nfocus of biocatalysis, since (in many cases) the efficacy of the\\nreaction
      one discovers is primarily dependent on the efficacy of the\\noptimization method
      used.\\n\\nIn contrast, it seems that meta-optimization has historically attracted\\nless
      attention from \\\"classic\\\" organic chemists, despite the central\\nimportance
      of reaction optimization to so much of what we do. This post\\naims to show
      some of the ways in which this paradigm is changing, and\\nbriefly summarize
      some of what I consider to be the most interesting and\\nexciting recent advances
      in chemical meta-optimization. *(This is a big\\nand somewhat nebulous area,
      and I am certainly leaving things out or not\\npaying due homage to everyone.
      Sorry in advance!)*\\n\\n### Design of Experiments, and Dealing with Discrete
      Variables\\n\\nPerhaps the best-known optimization algorithm in chemistry is
      \\\"design of\\nexperiments\\\" (DoE), which uses statistical methods to estimate
      the shape\\nof a multiparameter surface and find minima or maxima more efficiently\\nthan
      one-factor-at-a-time screening. (DoE is a pretty broad term that\\ngets used
      to describe a lot of different techniques: for more reading,\\n[see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_surface_methodology)\\n[these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_composite_design)\\n[links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Behnken_design).)\\n\\nDoE
      has been used for a long time, [especially in process\\nchemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/op500169m),
      and is very\\neffective at optimizing continuous variables (like temperature,\\nconcentration,
      and equivalents). However, it's less obvious how DoE\\nmight be extended to
      discrete variables. ([This 2010\\nreport](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ol1020898),
      from scientists\\nat Eli Lilly, reports the use of DoE to optimize a palladium-catalyzed\\npyrazole
      arylation, but without many details about the statistical\\nmethods used.)\\n\\n[A
      nice paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/op300275p) from Jonathan\\nMoseley
      and co-workers illustrates why discrete variables are so tricky:\\n\\n> How
      does one compare such different solvents as hexane and DMSO for\\n> example?
      Comparing their relative polarities, which is often related\\n> to solubility,
      might be one way, but this may not be the most\\n> important factor for the
      reaction in question. Additionally, this\\n> simple trend may not be relevant
      in any case, given for example that\\n> chlorinated solvents have good solubilising
      power despite their\\n> low-to-medium polarity (as judged by their dielectric
      constant). On\\n> the other hand, the high polarity and solubilising power of
      alcohols\\n> might be compromised in the desired reaction by their protic nature,\\n>
      whilst the \\\"unrelated\\\" hexane and DMSO are both aprotic.  \\n>   \\n>
      In summary, replacing any one of the discrete parameters with another\\n> does
      not yield a different value on the same axis of a graph, as it\\n> would for
      a continuous parameter; instead it requires a different\\n> graph with different
      axes which may have no meaningful relationship to\\n> the first one whatsoever.
      This means that every single combination of\\n> catalyst/ligand/base/solvent
      is essentially a different reaction for\\n> the same two starting materials
      to produce the same product.\\n> *(emphasis added)*\\n\\nThe solution the authors
      propose is to use principal component analysis\\n(PCA) on molecular descriptors,
      such as \\\"measurable physical factors\\n(e.g., bp, density, bond length),
      or calculated and theoretical ones\\n(e.g., electron density, Hansen solubility
      parameters, Kamlet--Taft\\nsolvent polarity parameters),\\\" to convert discrete
      parameters into\\ncontinuous ones. This general approach for handling discrete\\nvariables---generation
      of continuous molecular descriptors, followed by\\nuse of a dimensionality reduction
      algorithm---is widely used today for\\nlots of tasks (see for instance [this\\npaper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ob/c5ob01892g)\\non
      DoE for solvent screening, and [my previous post on\\nUMAP](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220926_plotting_diversity.html)).\\n\\n###
      Choosing Intelligent Screening Sets\\n\\nWith continuous descriptors for formally
      discrete variables in hand, a\\nnatural next step is to use this data to choose
      catalyst/substrates that\\nbest cover chemical space. (This can be done with
      several algorithms;\\nsee [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm9700878?ref=PDF)
      for\\nmore discussion) In 2016, this technique was popularized by the Merck\\n[\\\"informer\\nlibrary\\\"](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/sc/c5sc04751j)\\napproach,
      which generated sets of aryl boronic esters and aryl halides\\nthat could be
      used to fairly evaluate new reactions against complex,\\ndrug-like substrates.

      the Merck informer libraries were intended to be shared and used\\nby lots of
      research groups, recently it's become more common for\\nindividual research
      groups to design their own project-specific\\nscreening sets. Abbie Doyle and
      co-workers [kicked this\\noff](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)
      in 2022 by using\\nDFT-based descriptors, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and
      agglomerative\\nhierarchical clustering to generate a maximally diverse set
      of\\ncommercial aryl bromides. Other groups soon followed suit: [Karl\\nGademann](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01813)
      used this\\napproach to study bromotetrazine cross coupling, while Marion Emmert
      and\\nco-workers at Merck [employed similar\\nmethods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c10557)
      to\\ninvestigate azole carboxylation. (I've also used this approach for\\nsubstrate
      selection!)\\n\\nThis approach can also be used to design intelligent sets of\\ncatalysts/ligands
      at the outset of a screening project. Using [their\\n\\\"kraken\\\" dataset
      of phosphine\\nproperties](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c09718), Tobias\\nGensch
      and Matt Sigman [proposed a set of 32 commercially available\\nligands](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01970)
      which aims\\nto cover as much of phosphine chemical space as possible in an
      initial\\nscreen. Jason Stevens and co-workers combined this idea with the\\nsubstrate-selection
      methods from the previous paragraph to [perform a\\ndetailed study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.2c00089)\\nof
      Ni-catalyzed borylation under many conditions, and tested a variety\\nof ML
      models on the resulting dataset. (Scott Denmark and co-workers\\nhave also used
      a variant of this idea, called the Universal Training\\nSet, to [initialize
      ML-driven reaction\\noptimization](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5631).)\\n\\n###
      New Optimization Algorithms\\n\\nAs in every area of life, ML-based approaches
      have been used a lot for\\noptimization recently. This isn't new; Klaus Jensen
      and Steve Buchwald\\n[used machine\\nlearning](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/RE/C6RE00153J)\\nto
      drive autonomous optimization in 2016, and [Richard\\nZare](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492)
      published a\\ndetailed methodological study in 2017. Nevertheless, as with\\ncomputational
      substrate selection, these techniques have come into the\\nmainstream in the
      past few years.\\n\\nI mentioned the work of Scott Denmark on ML-driven optimization
      before,\\nand his team published two more papers on this topic last year: [one
      on\\natropselective biaryl\\niodination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08820),
      and [one on\\noptimization of](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)\\n*[Cinchona](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)*\\n[alkaloid-based
      phase transfer\\ncatalysts](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155).
      In\\nparticular, the second paper (conducted in collaboration with scientists\\nat
      Merck) illustrates how an ML model can be updated with new data as\\noptimization
      progresses, allowing many sequential rounds of catalyst\\ndevelopment to be
      conducted.\\n\\nAbbie Doyle's group has done a lot of work on using [Bayesian\\noptimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)
      (BO)\\nto drive reaction optimization. [Their first\\npaper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03213-y)
      in this area\\nillustrated the capacity of BO to avoid spurious local minima,
      and went\\non to validate this approach in a variety of complex problems. Even\\nbetter,
      they compared the results of BO to chemist-guided optimization\\nto see if computer-driven
      optimization could outcompete expert\\nintuition. To quote the paper:\\n\\n>
      In total, 50 expert chemists and engineers from academia and industry\\n> played
      the reaction optimization game (Fig. 4c). Accordingly, the\\n> Bayesian reaction
      optimizer also played the game 50 times (Fig. 4b),\\n> each time starting with
      a different random initialization. The first\\n> point of comparison between
      human participants and the machine\\n> learning optimizer was their raw maximum
      observed yield at each step\\n> during the optimization. Humans made significantly
      (*p* \\\\< 0.05)\\n> better initial choices than random selection, on average
      discovering\\n> conditions that had 15% higher yield in their first batch of\\n>
      experiments. However, even with random initialization, within three\\n> batches
      of five experiments the average performance of the optimizer\\n> surpassed that
      of the humans. Notably, in contrast to human\\n> participants, Bayesian optimization
      achieved \\\\>99% yield 100% of the\\n> time within the experimental budget.
      Moreover, Bayesian optimization\\n> tended to discover globally optimal conditions
      (CgMe-PPh, CsOPiv or\\n> CsOAc, DMAc, 0.153 M, 105\u2009\xB0C) within the first
      50 experiments (Fig.\\n> 4b). *(emphasis added)*\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b96de0-41b9-4149-99a5-3cc1b47b32ac_634x680.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      from\\nAspuru-Guzik, Burke, and co-workers, which uses a \\\"matrix-down\\\"
      approach\\nto choosing representative substrates for the Suzuki reaction (similar\\nto
      the substrate-selection algorithms discussed previously). The\\nselected substrates
      are then subjected to automated high-throughput\\nscreening guided by an uncertainty-minimizing
      ML model (i.e., new\\nreactions are chosen based on the regions of chemical
      space that the\\nalgorithm has the least knowledge about; this is similar to,
      but\\ndistinct from, Bayesian optimization). This is a pretty interesting\\napproach,
      and I hope they study it further in the future. (Aspuru-Guzik\\nhas done [lots
      of other work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03716) in this\\narea, including some
      [Bayesian\\noptimization](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307).)\\n\\nFinally,
      two papers this year (that I'm aware of) put forward the idea\\nof using multi-substrate
      loss functions for optimization: [our work on\\nscreening for\\ngenerality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05263-2)
      and [a\\nbeautiful\\ncollaboration](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/636a84ab80c9bf01cc8d95f9)\\nfrom
      Song Lin, Scott Miller, and Matt Sigman. These papers used\\n\\\"low-tech\\\"
      optimization methods that are familiar to practicing organic\\nchemists (e.g.
      \\\"screen different groups at this position\\\"), but\\nevaluated the output
      of this optimization not based on the\\nyield/enantioselectivity of a single
      substrate but on aggregate metrics\\nderived from many substrates. The results
      that our groups were able to\\nuncover were good, but I'm sure adding robotics
      and advanced ML\\noptimization will turbocharge this concept and find new and
      better\\ncatalysts with truly remarkable generality.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nReaction
      optimization is a common task in organic chemistry, but one\\nthat's commonly
      done without much metacognition. Instead, many\\nresearchers will screen catalysts,
      substrates, and conditions based on\\nhabit or convenience, without necessarily
      dwelling on whether their\\nscreening procedure is optimal. While this may work
      well enough when you\\nonly need to optimize one or two reactions in your whole
      graduate school\\ncareer (or when acquiring each data point takes days or weeks),
      *ad hoc*\\nstrategies will at some point simply fail to scale.\\n\\nOrganic
      chemistry, long the realm of \\\"small data,\\\" is slowly but\\ninexorably
      catching up with the adjacent sciences. As progress in lab\\nautomation and
      instrumentation makes setting up, purifying, and\\nanalyzing large numbers of
      reactions easier, experimental chemists will\\nhave to figure out how to choose
      which reactions to run and how to\\nhandle all the data from these reactions,
      using tools like the ones\\ndiscussed above. Like it or not, data science and

      generic optimization (image credit to <a\\nhref=\\\"https://mpalaourg.me/project/optimization-algorithms/\\\">Georgios\\nBalaouras</a>).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nMeta-optimization
      has long been a focus of research in computer science,\\nwhere new optimization
      algorithms can have an incredibly high impact\\n(e.g. [ADAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf),
      one of the most\\ncommonly used optimizers for neural network training). More
      recently,\\nthe advent of directed evolution has made optimization methods a
      central\\nfocus of biocatalysis, since (in many cases) the efficacy of the\\nreaction
      one discovers is primarily dependent on the efficacy of the\\noptimization method
      used.\\n\\nIn contrast, it seems that meta-optimization has historically attracted\\nless
      attention from \\\"classic\\\" organic chemists, despite the central\\nimportance
      of reaction optimization to so much of what we do. This post\\naims to show
      some of the ways in which this paradigm is changing, and\\nbriefly summarize
      some of what I consider to be the most interesting and\\nexciting recent advances
      in chemical meta-optimization. *(This is a big\\nand somewhat nebulous area,
      and I am certainly leaving things out or not\\npaying due homage to everyone.
      Sorry in advance!)*\\n\\n### Design of Experiments, and Dealing with Discrete
      Variables\\n\\nPerhaps the best-known optimization algorithm in chemistry is
      \\\"design of\\nexperiments\\\" (DoE), which uses statistical methods to estimate
      the shape\\nof a multiparameter surface and find minima or maxima more efficiently\\nthan
      one-factor-at-a-time screening. (DoE is a pretty broad term that\\ngets used
      to describe a lot of different techniques: for more reading,\\n[see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_surface_methodology)\\n[these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_composite_design)\\n[links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Behnken_design).)\\n\\nDoE
      has been used for a long time, [especially in process\\nchemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/op500169m),
      and is very\\neffective at optimizing continuous variables (like temperature,\\nconcentration,
      and equivalents). However, it's less obvious how DoE\\nmight be extended to
      discrete variables. ([This 2010\\nreport](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ol1020898),
      from scientists\\nat Eli Lilly, reports the use of DoE to optimize a palladium-catalyzed\\npyrazole
      arylation, but without many details about the statistical\\nmethods used.)\\n\\n[A
      nice paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/op300275p) from Jonathan\\nMoseley
      and co-workers illustrates why discrete variables are so tricky:\\n\\n> How
      does one compare such different solvents as hexane and DMSO for\\n> example?
      Comparing their relative polarities, which is often related\\n> to solubility,
      might be one way, but this may not be the most\\n> important factor for the
      reaction in question. Additionally, this\\n> simple trend may not be relevant
      in any case, given for example that\\n> chlorinated solvents have good solubilising
      power despite their\\n> low-to-medium polarity (as judged by their dielectric
      constant). On\\n> the other hand, the high polarity and solubilising power of
      alcohols\\n> might be compromised in the desired reaction by their protic nature,\\n>
      whilst the \\\"unrelated\\\" hexane and DMSO are both aprotic.  \\n>   \\n>
      In summary, replacing any one of the discrete parameters with another\\n> does
      not yield a different value on the same axis of a graph, as it\\n> would for
      a continuous parameter; instead it requires a different\\n> graph with different
      axes which may have no meaningful relationship to\\n> the first one whatsoever.
      This means that every single combination of\\n> catalyst/ligand/base/solvent
      is essentially a different reaction for\\n> the same two starting materials
      to produce the same product.\\n> *(emphasis added)*\\n\\nThe solution the authors
      propose is to use principal component analysis\\n(PCA) on molecular descriptors,
      such as \\\"measurable physical factors\\n(e.g., bp, density, bond length),
      or calculated and theoretical ones\\n(e.g., electron density, Hansen solubility
      parameters, Kamlet--Taft\\nsolvent polarity parameters),\\\" to convert discrete
      parameters into\\ncontinuous ones. This general approach for handling discrete\\nvariables---generation
      of continuous molecular descriptors, followed by\\nuse of a dimensionality reduction
      algorithm---is widely used today for\\nlots of tasks (see for instance [this\\npaper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ob/c5ob01892g)\\non
      DoE for solvent screening, and [my previous post on\\nUMAP](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20220926_plotting_diversity.html)).\\n\\n###
      Choosing Intelligent Screening Sets\\n\\nWith continuous descriptors for formally
      discrete variables in hand, a\\nnatural next step is to use this data to choose
      catalyst/substrates that\\nbest cover chemical space. (This can be done with
      several algorithms;\\nsee [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm9700878?ref=PDF)
      for\\nmore discussion) In 2016, this technique was popularized by the Merck\\n[\\\"informer\\nlibrary\\\"](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/sc/c5sc04751j)\\napproach,
      which generated sets of aryl boronic esters and aryl halides\\nthat could be
      used to fairly evaluate new reactions against complex,\\ndrug-like substrates.
      (See also [this recent\\nperspective](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00760)\\non

      of the Merck informer library (yellow) in\\nchemical space, compared to drugs
      (grey) and compounds from recent\\nliterature (blue).</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWhile
      the Merck informer libraries were intended to be shared and used\\nby lots of
      research groups, recently it's become more common for\\nindividual research
      groups to design their own project-specific\\nscreening sets. Abbie Doyle and
      co-workers [kicked this\\noff](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12203)
      in 2022 by using\\nDFT-based descriptors, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and
      agglomerative\\nhierarchical clustering to generate a maximally diverse set
      of\\ncommercial aryl bromides. Other groups soon followed suit: [Karl\\nGademann](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01813)
      used this\\napproach to study bromotetrazine cross coupling, while Marion Emmert
      and\\nco-workers at Merck [employed similar\\nmethods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c10557)
      to\\ninvestigate azole carboxylation. (I've also used this approach for\\nsubstrate
      selection!)\\n\\nThis approach can also be used to design intelligent sets of\\ncatalysts/ligands
      at the outset of a screening project. Using [their\\n\\\"kraken\\\" dataset
      of phosphine\\nproperties](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c09718), Tobias\\nGensch
      and Matt Sigman [proposed a set of 32 commercially available\\nligands](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01970)
      which aims\\nto cover as much of phosphine chemical space as possible in an
      initial\\nscreen. Jason Stevens and co-workers combined this idea with the\\nsubstrate-selection
      methods from the previous paragraph to [perform a\\ndetailed study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.2c00089)\\nof
      Ni-catalyzed borylation under many conditions, and tested a variety\\nof ML
      models on the resulting dataset. (Scott Denmark and co-workers\\nhave also used
      a variant of this idea, called the Universal Training\\nSet, to [initialize
      ML-driven reaction\\noptimization](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5631).)\\n\\n###
      New Optimization Algorithms\\n\\nAs in every area of life, ML-based approaches
      have been used a lot for\\noptimization recently. This isn't new; Klaus Jensen
      and Steve Buchwald\\n[used machine\\nlearning](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/RE/C6RE00153J)\\nto
      drive autonomous optimization in 2016, and [Richard\\nZare](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492)
      published a\\ndetailed methodological study in 2017. Nevertheless, as with\\ncomputational
      substrate selection, these techniques have come into the\\nmainstream in the
      past few years.\\n\\nI mentioned the work of Scott Denmark on ML-driven optimization
      before,\\nand his team published two more papers on this topic last year: [one
      on\\natropselective biaryl\\niodination](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c08820),
      and [one on\\noptimization of](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)\\n*[Cinchona](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155)*\\n[alkaloid-based
      phase transfer\\ncatalysts](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.oprd.1c00155).
      In\\nparticular, the second paper (conducted in collaboration with scientists\\nat
      Merck) illustrates how an ML model can be updated with new data as\\noptimization
      progresses, allowing many sequential rounds of catalyst\\ndevelopment to be
      conducted.\\n\\nAbbie Doyle's group has done a lot of work on using [Bayesian\\noptimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)
      (BO)\\nto drive reaction optimization. [Their first\\npaper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03213-y)
      in this area\\nillustrated the capacity of BO to avoid spurious local minima,
      and went\\non to validate this approach in a variety of complex problems. Even\\nbetter,
      they compared the results of BO to chemist-guided optimization\\nto see if computer-driven
      optimization could outcompete expert\\nintuition. To quote the paper:\\n\\n>
      In total, 50 expert chemists and engineers from academia and industry\\n> played
      the reaction optimization game (Fig. 4c). Accordingly, the\\n> Bayesian reaction
      optimizer also played the game 50 times (Fig. 4b),\\n> each time starting with
      a different random initialization. The first\\n> point of comparison between
      human participants and the machine\\n> learning optimizer was their raw maximum
      observed yield at each step\\n> during the optimization. Humans made significantly
      (*p* \\\\< 0.05)\\n> better initial choices than random selection, on average
      discovering\\n> conditions that had 15% higher yield in their first batch of\\n>
      experiments. However, even with random initialization, within three\\n> batches
      of five experiments the average performance of the optimizer\\n> surpassed that
      of the humans. Notably, in contrast to human\\n> participants, Bayesian optimization
      achieved \\\\>99% yield 100% of the\\n> time within the experimental budget.
      Moreover, Bayesian optimization\\n> tended to discover globally optimal conditions
      (CgMe-PPh, CsOPiv or\\n> CsOAc, DMAc, 0.153 M, 105\u2009\xB0C) within the first
      50 experiments (Fig.\\n> 4b). *(emphasis added)*\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b96de0-41b9-4149-99a5-3cc1b47b32ac_634x680.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      strategy to other reactions.\\n\\nClosely related is [this\\nwork](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc8743)
      from\\nAspuru-Guzik, Burke, and co-workers, which uses a \\\"matrix-down\\\"
      approach\\nto choosing representative substrates for the Suzuki reaction (similar\\nto
      the substrate-selection algorithms discussed previously). The\\nselected substrates
      are then subjected to automated high-throughput\\nscreening guided by an uncertainty-minimizing
      ML model (i.e., new\\nreactions are chosen based on the regions of chemical
      space that the\\nalgorithm has the least knowledge about; this is similar to,
      but\\ndistinct from, Bayesian optimization). This is a pretty interesting\\napproach,
      and I hope they study it further in the future. (Aspuru-Guzik\\nhas done [lots
      of other work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03716) in this\\narea, including some
      [Bayesian\\noptimization](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307).)\\n\\nFinally,
      two papers this year (that I'm aware of) put forward the idea\\nof using multi-substrate
      loss functions for optimization: [our work on\\nscreening for\\ngenerality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05263-2)
      and [a\\nbeautiful\\ncollaboration](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/636a84ab80c9bf01cc8d95f9)\\nfrom
      Song Lin, Scott Miller, and Matt Sigman. These papers used\\n\\\"low-tech\\\"
      optimization methods that are familiar to practicing organic\\nchemists (e.g.
      \\\"screen different groups at this position\\\"), but\\nevaluated the output
      of this optimization not based on the\\nyield/enantioselectivity of a single
      substrate but on aggregate metrics\\nderived from many substrates. The results
      that our groups were able to\\nuncover were good, but I'm sure adding robotics
      and advanced ML\\noptimization will turbocharge this concept and find new and
      better\\ncatalysts with truly remarkable generality.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nReaction
      optimization is a common task in organic chemistry, but one\\nthat's commonly
      done without much metacognition. Instead, many\\nresearchers will screen catalysts,
      substrates, and conditions based on\\nhabit or convenience, without necessarily
      dwelling on whether their\\nscreening procedure is optimal. While this may work
      well enough when you\\nonly need to optimize one or two reactions in your whole
      graduate school\\ncareer (or when acquiring each data point takes days or weeks),
      *ad hoc*\\nstrategies will at some point simply fail to scale.\\n\\nOrganic
      chemistry, long the realm of \\\"small data,\\\" is slowly but\\ninexorably
      catching up with the adjacent sciences. As progress in lab\\nautomation and
      instrumentation makes setting up, purifying, and\\nanalyzing large numbers of
      reactions easier, experimental chemists will\\nhave to figure out how to choose
      which reactions to run and how to\\nhandle all the data from these reactions,
      using tools like the ones\\ndiscussed above. Like it or not, data science and
      cheminformatics may\\nsoon become core competencies of the modern experimental
      chemist!\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"114373973\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      that are substantially sp^2^-hybridized at carbon,\nirrespective of whether
      sp^2^ character is technically increasing or\ndecreasing in the elementary step.
      Relative to the starting material,\nboth transition states look like iminium
      ions and thus lead to large\nisotope effects.\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2e1afd8-2697-474b-80c6-46e8178520c8_964x346.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      both look pretty much like iminium ions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nWe
      can also conceptualize this in terms of elementary steps. Taken by\nitself,
      alkene addition does lead to an inverse kinetic isotope effect,\nas seen by
      the decreasing values as one moves left from the\niminium---but an inverse isotope
      effect relative to the normal\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium. In
      this system, the\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium is larger than the
      kinetic\nisotope effect for alkene addition, and so the combination of these
      two\neffects leads to a (smaller) overall normal effect.\n\n(This is the opposite
      of primary H/D KIEs, where central transition\nstates lead to the largest isotope
      effects and equilibrium effects are\ntypically small. Here, the isotope effect
      is mainly a function of\nhybridization, and so the later the TS, the greater
      the difference in\nhybridization and the larger the isotope effect.)\n\nIn summary,
      although this experiment seems informative, it''s actually\nnot very useful.
      It tells you something about the structure of the\ntransition state, but not
      which step is rate-limiting! In this case, a\nbetter experiment would be to
      measure ^13^C KIEs, or an H/D KIE on the\nnucleophile.\n\n### Appendix I: What
      About S~N~2?\n\nOn Twitter, [Mark\nLevin](https://twitter.com/LevinChem/status/1610287881993728000)
      asks\nabout the KIE for the concerted path. I originally meant to include a\ndiscussion
      of this, but then totally forgot to! So let''s fix that.\n\nAs shown in the
      graph above, extremely concerted pathways (i.e. going\nright down the middle
      of the MOJ plot) will have pretty small isotope\neffects. These sorts of mechanisms
      are common where the carbocation\nwould be extremely unstable (methyl iodide)
      but much less common for\nstabilized carbocations like we''re discussing here.
      When oxocarbeniums\nor iminiums are involved, even \"concerted\" mechanisms
      shift towards the\nbottom right corner: this is the [\"loose\"/\"exploded\"\nS~N~2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja506092h)
      often seen in\nglycosylation. These pathways will have a modest to large H/D
      KIE,\ndepending on the exact system and how \"exploded\" they are (see page
      53\nof [this SI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621) for\nexamples)\n\nPutting
      this together, then, what experimental results would be\nconclusive? A very
      small KIE would be diagnostic for a \"classic\"\nsynchronous S~N~2 process,
      which I consider to be very unlikely here.\nBut medium or large H/D KIEs are
      consistent with any possibility: S~N~1\nwith rate-limiting ionization, S~N~1
      with rate-limiting nucleophilic\nattack, or a loose S~N~2. There''s an annulus
      of different mechanistic\npossibilities that all give about the same isotope
      effect, as shown\nbelow:\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa99b0e0a-d450-40f1-a1b7-67dbab86f1b7_1679x1638.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      both look pretty much like iminium ions.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWe
      can also conceptualize this in terms of elementary steps. Taken by\\nitself,
      alkene addition does lead to an inverse kinetic isotope effect,\\nas seen by
      the decreasing values as one moves left from the\\niminium---but an inverse
      isotope effect relative to the normal\\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium.
      In this system, the\\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium is larger than
      the kinetic\\nisotope effect for alkene addition, and so the combination of
      these two\\neffects leads to a (smaller) overall normal effect.\\n\\n(This is
      the opposite of primary H/D KIEs, where central transition\\nstates lead to
      the largest isotope effects and equilibrium effects are\\ntypically small. Here,
      the isotope effect is mainly a function of\\nhybridization, and so the later
      the TS, the greater the difference in\\nhybridization and the larger the isotope
      effect.)\\n\\nIn summary, although this experiment seems informative, it's actually\\nnot
      very useful. It tells you something about the structure of the\\ntransition
      state, but not which step is rate-limiting! In this case, a\\nbetter experiment
      would be to measure ^13^C KIEs, or an H/D KIE on the\\nnucleophile.\\n\\n###
      Appendix I: What About S~N~2?\\n\\nOn Twitter, [Mark\\nLevin](https://twitter.com/LevinChem/status/1610287881993728000)
      asks\\nabout the KIE for the concerted path. I originally meant to include a\\ndiscussion
      of this, but then totally forgot to! So let's fix that.\\n\\nAs shown in the
      graph above, extremely concerted pathways (i.e. going\\nright down the middle
      of the MOJ plot) will have pretty small isotope\\neffects. These sorts of mechanisms
      are common where the carbocation\\nwould be extremely unstable (methyl iodide)
      but much less common for\\nstabilized carbocations like we're discussing here.
      When oxocarbeniums\\nor iminiums are involved, even \\\"concerted\\\" mechanisms
      shift towards the\\nbottom right corner: this is the [\\\"loose\\\"/\\\"exploded\\\"\\nS~N~2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja506092h)
      often seen in\\nglycosylation. These pathways will have a modest to large H/D
      KIE,\\ndepending on the exact system and how \\\"exploded\\\" they are (see
      page 53\\nof [this SI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621) for\\nexamples)\\n\\nPutting
      this together, then, what experimental results would be\\nconclusive? A very
      small KIE would be diagnostic for a \\\"classic\\\"\\nsynchronous S~N~2 process,
      which I consider to be very unlikely here.\\nBut medium or large H/D KIEs are
      consistent with any possibility: S~N~1\\nwith rate-limiting ionization, S~N~1
      with rate-limiting nucleophilic\\nattack, or a loose S~N~2. There's an annulus
      of different mechanistic\\npossibilities that all give about the same isotope
      effect, as shown\\nbelow:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa99b0e0a-d450-40f1-a1b7-67dbab86f1b7_1679x1638.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      both look pretty much like iminium ions.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nWe
      can also conceptualize this in terms of elementary steps. Taken by\\nitself,
      alkene addition does lead to an inverse kinetic isotope effect,\\nas seen by
      the decreasing values as one moves left from the\\niminium---but an inverse
      isotope effect relative to the normal\\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium.
      In this system, the\\nequilibrium isotope effect of the iminium is larger than
      the kinetic\\nisotope effect for alkene addition, and so the combination of
      these two\\neffects leads to a (smaller) overall normal effect.\\n\\n(This is
      the opposite of primary H/D KIEs, where central transition\\nstates lead to
      the largest isotope effects and equilibrium effects are\\ntypically small. Here,
      the isotope effect is mainly a function of\\nhybridization, and so the later
      the TS, the greater the difference in\\nhybridization and the larger the isotope
      effect.)\\n\\nIn summary, although this experiment seems informative, it's actually\\nnot
      very useful. It tells you something about the structure of the\\ntransition
      state, but not which step is rate-limiting! In this case, a\\nbetter experiment
      would be to measure ^13^C KIEs, or an H/D KIE on the\\nnucleophile.\\n\\n###
      Appendix I: What About S~N~2?\\n\\nOn Twitter, [Mark\\nLevin](https://twitter.com/LevinChem/status/1610287881993728000)
      asks\\nabout the KIE for the concerted path. I originally meant to include a\\ndiscussion
      of this, but then totally forgot to! So let's fix that.\\n\\nAs shown in the
      graph above, extremely concerted pathways (i.e. going\\nright down the middle
      of the MOJ plot) will have pretty small isotope\\neffects. These sorts of mechanisms
      are common where the carbocation\\nwould be extremely unstable (methyl iodide)
      but much less common for\\nstabilized carbocations like we're discussing here.
      When oxocarbeniums\\nor iminiums are involved, even \\\"concerted\\\" mechanisms
      shift towards the\\nbottom right corner: this is the [\\\"loose\\\"/\\\"exploded\\\"\\nS~N~2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja506092h)
      often seen in\\nglycosylation. These pathways will have a modest to large H/D
      KIE,\\ndepending on the exact system and how \\\"exploded\\\" they are (see
      page 53\\nof [this SI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b10621) for\\nexamples)\\n\\nPutting
      this together, then, what experimental results would be\\nconclusive? A very
      small KIE would be diagnostic for a \\\"classic\\\"\\nsynchronous S~N~2 process,
      which I consider to be very unlikely here.\\nBut medium or large H/D KIEs are
      consistent with any possibility: S~N~1\\nwith rate-limiting ionization, S~N~1
      with rate-limiting nucleophilic\\nattack, or a loose S~N~2. There's an annulus
      of different mechanistic\\npossibilities that all give about the same isotope
      effect, as shown\\nbelow:\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa99b0e0a-d450-40f1-a1b7-67dbab86f1b7_1679x1638.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link

      molecules exist in a\nplethora of conformations, and so just considering the
      lowest energy\nconformer might be totally irrelevant. To quote a [recent\nperspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202205735)\nfrom
      Grimme and friends:\n\n> For highly flexible structures, a molecular property,
      such as energy,\n> nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, or optical rotation values
      may not\n> be sufficiently described by a single structure. At finite\n> temperatures,
      various conformers are populated and the overall\n> property must be described
      as thermal average over the unique property\n> values of each conformer.\n\nWhat\\''s
      been bothering me about this, however, is that Boltzmann weights\nare calculated
      as *e* to the power of the relative energy:\n\n    def boltzmann_weight(conformer_properties,
      conformer_energies, temp=298):\n        \"\"\" Some simple Python code to calculate
      Boltzmann weights. \"\"\"\n\n        energies = conformer_energies - np.min(conformer_energies)\n\n        R
      = 3.1668105e-6 # eH/K\n        weights = np.exp(-1*energies/(627.509*R*temp))\n        weights
      = weights / np.sum(weights)\n\n        return weights, np.average(conformer_properties,
      weights=weights)\n\nSince relative energies of conformers are usually calculated
      with only\nmiddling accuracy (\u00b10.2 kcal/mol with [common\nmethods](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/cp/c0cp02984j)),\nwe''re
      taking the exponential of a potentially inaccurate value---which\nseems bad
      from the standpoint of error propagation!\n\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\n<figure>\n<a\nhref=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99b5ff0c-dd8d-43ec-90ee-7c14ac62b424_772x480.png\"\nclass=\"image-link

      from <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2295/\">xkcd</a>, on\nerror propagation (line
      #3 is what''s relevant here).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nGrimme and co-authors
      address this point explicitly in their review:\n\n> At the same time, however,
      conformational energies need to be accurate\n> to within about 0.1--0.2\u2005kcal
      mol^\u22121^ to predict Boltzmann populations\n> at room temperature reasonably
      well. This is particularly important\n> since properties can vary strongly and
      even qualitatively between\n> populated conformers...\n\nAlthough the best answer
      is, of course, to just get more accurate\nenergies, it\\''s not always practical
      to do that in the real world. If we\ntake imperfect energies as our starting
      point, what\\''s the best strategy\nto pursue?\n\nOne could imagine a scenario
      in which error causes relatively\nunimportant conformers to end up with large
      weights, making the answer\neven worse than the na\u00efve approach would have
      been. If the lowest energy\nconformer accounts for 60-70% of the answer, might
      it be best to just\nstick with that, instead of trying to throw in some messy
      corrections?\n\nTo test this, I drew a random flexible-looking molecule with
      a few\nfunctional groups, conducted a conformational search using *crest*, and\nthen
      optimized it and calculated ^19^F NMR shieldings using\nwB97X-D/6-31G(d). (There
      are [better NMR\nmethods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00624)
      out\nthere, but the absolute accuracy of the shift isn''t really the point\nhere.)\n\n:::

      complex molecules exist in a\\nplethora of conformations, and so just considering
      the lowest energy\\nconformer might be totally irrelevant. To quote a [recent\\nperspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202205735)\\nfrom
      Grimme and friends:\\n\\n> For highly flexible structures, a molecular property,
      such as energy,\\n> nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, or optical rotation
      values may not\\n> be sufficiently described by a single structure. At finite\\n>
      temperatures, various conformers are populated and the overall\\n> property
      must be described as thermal average over the unique property\\n> values of
      each conformer.\\n\\nWhat\\\\'s been bothering me about this, however, is that
      Boltzmann weights\\nare calculated as *e* to the power of the relative energy:\\n\\n

      and co-authors address this point explicitly in their review:\\n\\n> At the
      same time, however, conformational energies need to be accurate\\n> to within
      about 0.1--0.2\u2005kcal mol^\u22121^ to predict Boltzmann populations\\n> at
      room temperature reasonably well. This is particularly important\\n> since properties
      can vary strongly and even qualitatively between\\n> populated conformers...\\n\\nAlthough
      the best answer is, of course, to just get more accurate\\nenergies, it\\\\'s
      not always practical to do that in the real world. If we\\ntake imperfect energies
      as our starting point, what\\\\'s the best strategy\\nto pursue?\\n\\nOne could
      imagine a scenario in which error causes relatively\\nunimportant conformers
      to end up with large weights, making the answer\\neven worse than the na\xEFve
      approach would have been. If the lowest energy\\nconformer accounts for 60-70%
      of the answer, might it be best to just\\nstick with that, instead of trying
      to throw in some messy corrections?\\n\\nTo test this, I drew a random flexible-looking
      molecule with a few\\nfunctional groups, conducted a conformational search using
      *crest*, and\\nthen optimized it and calculated ^19^F NMR shieldings using\\nwB97X-D/6-31G(d).
      (There are [better NMR\\nmethods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00624)
      out\\nthere, but the absolute accuracy of the shift isn't really the point\\nhere.)\\n\\n:::

      technique that I've seen employed more and more in computational\\npapers over
      the past few years is to calculate Boltzmann-weighted\\naverages of some property
      over a conformational ensemble. This is\\npotentially very useful because most
      complex molecules exist in a\\nplethora of conformations, and so just considering
      the lowest energy\\nconformer might be totally irrelevant. To quote a [recent\\nperspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202205735)\\nfrom
      Grimme and friends:\\n\\n> For highly flexible structures, a molecular property,
      such as energy,\\n> nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, or optical rotation
      values may not\\n> be sufficiently described by a single structure. At finite\\n>
      temperatures, various conformers are populated and the overall\\n> property
      must be described as thermal average over the unique property\\n> values of
      each conformer.\\n\\nWhat\\\\'s been bothering me about this, however, is that
      Boltzmann weights\\nare calculated as *e* to the power of the relative energy:\\n\\n
      \   def boltzmann_weight(conformer_properties, conformer_energies, temp=298):\\n
      \       \\\"\\\"\\\" Some simple Python code to calculate Boltzmann weights.
      \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n        energies = conformer_energies - np.min(conformer_energies)\\n\\n
      \       R = 3.1668105e-6 # eH/K\\n        weights = np.exp(-1*energies/(627.509*R*temp))\\n
      \       weights = weights / np.sum(weights)\\n\\n        return weights, np.average(conformer_properties,
      weights=weights)\\n\\nSince relative energies of conformers are usually calculated
      with only\\nmiddling accuracy (\xB10.2 kcal/mol with [common\\nmethods](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/cp/c0cp02984j)),\\nwe're
      taking the exponential of a potentially inaccurate value---which\\nseems bad

      the best answer is, of course, to just get more accurate\\nenergies, it\\\\'s
      not always practical to do that in the real world. If we\\ntake imperfect energies
      as our starting point, what\\\\'s the best strategy\\nto pursue?\\n\\nOne could
      imagine a scenario in which error causes relatively\\nunimportant conformers
      to end up with large weights, making the answer\\neven worse than the na\xEFve

      of the answer, might it be best to just\\nstick with that, instead of trying
      to throw in some messy corrections?\\n\\nTo test this, I drew a random flexible-looking
      molecule with a few\\nfunctional groups, conducted a conformational search using

      want to engage in some shameless self-promotion and highlight\nhow *[cctk](https://github.com/ekwan/cctk)*,
      an open-source Python\npackage that I develop and maintain with Eugene Kwan,
      can make\nconformational searching easy.\n\nConformational searching is a really
      crucial task in computational\nchemistry, because pretty much everything else
      you do depends on having\nthe correct structure in the computer. In simple cases
      you can just draw\nout every conformer manually, but as the system under study
      gains\ndegrees of freedom it becomes increasingly impractical to think through\nevery
      possibility.\n\nFailure to identify the correct conformer can lead to completely\nincorrect
      results, as demonstrated by Neese and coworkeers in [this\nrecent\narticle](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2022/SC/D2SC02274E).\nThey
      reexamine a reaction [originally studied by Ben\nList](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0445)

      1 from the paper; the previously reported conformers\nare shown in green.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nConformational
      searching approaches attempt to prevent this sort of\nerror by automating the
      process of finding conformers. There are lots of\ndifferent algorithms one can
      use, like [low-mode\nsearching](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja952478m),
      metadynamics,\nand replica exchange (to name just a few), and decades of literature
      on\nthis topic.\n\nSince conformational searching requires many individual calculations,\nit''s
      [almost never\npractical](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-0282-9_14)\nto
      do a conformational search at a high level of theory (e.g. using DFT\nor *ab
      initio* methods). Instead,\n[forcefields](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.2c00066)
      or\n[semiempirical](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00671)\nmethods
      are generally used, with the caveat that the conformers\ngenerated might have
      somewhat inaccurate geometries.\n\n*cctk* uses [crest](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/)
      (from\nGrimme and coworkers), which uses a [metadynamics-based\nalgorithm](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/page/overview/workflows.html#imtd-gc-algorithm)\nwith
      the *GFN2-xtb* semiempirical method to generate and score\nconformers. Although
      *crest* isn''t perfect, it''s simple, easy to use,\nand often generates very
      reasonable results.\n\nI personally find the *crest* syntax a little tough to
      remember, so I''ve\ncreated a Python script so that I don''t have to look it
      up every time.\n\n### Installing Packages\n\nTo run this tutorial, you''ll need
      to have *cctk* and *crest* installed.\nIt''s often easiest to manage dependencies
      using a *conda* environment;\nif you don''t already have one, you can create
      one for this project with\nthis code:\n\n    conda create --name=chem python=3.8\n    pip
      install cctk\n    pip install pyyaml\n    conda install -c conda-forge crest\n\nAnd
      in the future, you can activate the environment like this:\n\n    conda activate
      chem\n\n### Running the Tutorial\n\nThe files for this tutorial can be found\n[here](https://github.com/corinwagen/utilities/tree/master/csearch).\nex.yaml,
      which is the only file you should need to modify, contains all\nthe information
      needed for the python script do_crest.py:\n\n    # list of atoms to constrain\n    #
      atom1, atom2, distance (or \"auto\" to keep distance from initial geometry)\n    constraints:\n        constraint1:
      17 31 auto\n        constraint2: 30 31 auto\n\n    # location of input geometry,
      either as Gaussian .gjf or .out file\n    input_geom: pictet_spengler.gjf\n\n    #
      directory in which crest will run (will be created)\n    directory: crest\n\n    #
      name of logfile\n    logfile: crest.log\n\n    # whether or not this is a noncovalent
      complex (true or false).\n    # this simply gets passed to crest; some settings
      are changed.\n    noncovalent: false\n\nTo generate conformers, simply run:\n\n    python
      do_crest.py ex.yaml\n\nThis takes about 30 seconds to run on my laptop, and
      will generate about\na hundred output conformers, which can (if desired) be
      further refined\nusing DFT.\n\nHopefully this is useful! Please feel free to
      contact me with questions\nor bug reports.\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dbf3c31-2fc4-4393-ac76-7c766755f7c9_969x744.gif",

      searching approaches attempt to prevent this sort of\nerror by automating the
      process of finding conformers. There are lots of\ndifferent algorithms one can
      use, like [low-mode\nsearching](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja952478m),
      metadynamics,\nand replica exchange (to name just a few), and decades of literature
      on\nthis topic.\n\nSince conformational searching requires many individual calculations,\nit''s
      [almost never\npractical](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-0282-9_14)\nto
      do a conformational search at a high level of theory (e.g. using DFT\nor *ab
      initio* methods). Instead,\n[forcefields](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.2c00066)
      or\n[semiempirical](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00671)\nmethods
      are generally used, with the caveat that the conformers\ngenerated might have
      somewhat inaccurate geometries.\n\n*cctk* uses [crest](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/)
      (from\nGrimme and coworkers), which uses a [metadynamics-based\nalgorithm](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/page/overview/workflows.html#imtd-gc-algorithm)\nwith
      the *GFN2-xtb* semiempirical method to generate and score\nconformers. Although
      *crest* isn''t perfect, it''s simple, easy to use,\nand often generates very
      reasonable results.\n\nI personally find the *crest* syntax a little tough to
      remember, so I''ve\ncreated a Python script so that I don''t have to look it
      up every time.\n\n### Installing Packages\n\nTo run this tutorial, you''ll need
      to have *cctk* and *crest* installed.\nIt''s often easiest to manage dependencies
      using a *conda* environment;\nif you don''t already have one, you can create
      one for this project with\nthis code:\n\n    conda create --name=chem python=3.8\n    pip
      install cctk\n    pip install pyyaml\n    conda install -c conda-forge crest\n\nAnd
      in the future, you can activate the environment like this:\n\n    conda activate
      chem\n\n### Running the Tutorial\n\nThe files for this tutorial can be found\n[here](https://github.com/corinwagen/utilities/tree/master/csearch).\nex.yaml,
      which is the only file you should need to modify, contains all\nthe information
      needed for the python script do_crest.py:\n\n    # list of atoms to constrain\n    #
      atom1, atom2, distance (or \"auto\" to keep distance from initial geometry)\n    constraints:\n        constraint1:
      17 31 auto\n        constraint2: 30 31 auto\n\n    # location of input geometry,
      either as Gaussian .gjf or .out file\n    input_geom: pictet_spengler.gjf\n\n    #
      directory in which crest will run (will be created)\n    directory: crest\n\n    #
      name of logfile\n    logfile: crest.log\n\n    # whether or not this is a noncovalent
      complex (true or false).\n    # this simply gets passed to crest; some settings
      are changed.\n    noncovalent: false\n\nTo generate conformers, simply run:\n\n    python
      do_crest.py ex.yaml\n\nThis takes about 30 seconds to run on my laptop, and
      will generate about\na hundred output conformers, which can (if desired) be
      further refined\nusing DFT.\n\nHopefully this is useful! Please feel free to
      contact me with questions\nor bug reports.\n","relationships":[],"archive_url":null,"guid":"114373969","updated":false,"category":"chemicalSciences","abstract":null,"status":"active"}]'

      seems to have struck a nerve, I figured I should address some\ncommon objections
      people are raising.\n\nAlthough this is obvious, I wanted to preface all of
      this by saying:\nthis is my opinion, I\\''m not some expert on systems of science,
      and many\nof the criticisms come from people with much more scientific and\ninstitutional
      expertise than me. It\\''s very possible that I\\''m just\ntotally wrong here!
      But what I\\''m saying makes sense to me, and (it\nseems) to a lot of other
      people, so I think it\\''s at least worth having\nthis discussion.\n\n## Commenters
      Who Feel ^13^C NMR Is Scientifically Crucial\n\nA few people pointed out that
      there are lots of instances in which\ncarbon NMR *is* very important\n([1](https://twitter.com/MuhammadAdilSA/status/1603339486431416320),\n[2](https://twitter.com/craigdc1983/status/1603300877208621056),\n[3](https://twitter.com/Double_Anne_/status/1603358363580088320),\n[4](https://twitter.com/BogdosMichael/status/1603413304885612545),\n[5](https://twitter.com/OscarErlenmeyer/status/1603521689635414019)).
      I\ndon\\''t disagree with this at all; I\\''ve also used ^13^C NMR to solve\nproblems
      that ^1^H NMR and mass spectrometry alone couldn\\''t solve! But\njust because
      it''s crucial sometimes doesn''t mean it''s crucial all the\ntime. Does anyone
      really think that you need carbon NMR to tell if Boc\nprotection of a primary
      amine worked?\n\nMost of the reactions that people do---especially people for
      whom\nsynthetic chemistry is a means and not an end---are [pretty\nstraightforward](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409),\nsuch
      that I think it''s fair to assume you could deduce the correct\nproduct with
      high confidence without ^13^C NMR. (Again, if carbon\nspectra were so crucial,
      it wouldn''t be the case that many people don''t\nget them until the very end
      of the project.)\n\n## Commenters Who Feel That It\\''s Important To Have Non-Crucial
      Data To Test Your Hypotheses\n\nThis point was also made by a number of people\n([1](https://twitter.com/OrthaberLab/status/1603120117444919301),\n[2](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1603453351592706067),\n[3](https://twitter.com/andrechemist/status/1603465213436633088)),\nperhaps

      point---part of what we ought to do, as a\nscientific community, is challenge
      one another to test our hypotheses\nand scrutinize our assumptions. Nevertheless,
      I''m not convinced this is\na particularly strong argument for carbon NMR specifically.
      What makes\n^13^C{^1^H} spectra uniquely powerful at challenging one''s assumptions,\nas
      opposed to other data?\n\n[Keith\nFritzsching](https://twitter.com/kjfritzsc/status/1603224459753959424)\npoints
      out that HSQC is much faster and gives pretty comparable\ninformation (as did
      other readers, privately), and simply replacing\n^13^C with HSQC in most cases

      heard this from plenty of people before, and it\\''s true that\nsometimes it\\''s
      not hard at all to get a nice carbon spectrum! But\nsometimes it *is* really
      hard, also. Based on the other responses, it\nseems like lots of other people
      agree with this sentiment.\n\n(Is it possible that some of this disagreement
      reflects whether one has\naccess to a helium cryoprobe?)\n\n## Commenters Who
      Feel It\\''s Important To Have Consistent Journal Standards\n\nA few people
      pointed out that making carbon NMR necessary on a\ncase-by-case basis would
      be burdensome for editors and reviewers, since\nthey\\''d have to think through
      each case themselves\n([1](https://twitter.com/Double_Anne_/status/1603358846734548992),\n[2](https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/1603471344468840448)).
      This is a\nfair point, and one I don\\''t have a good response to.\n\nHowever,
      it\\''s worth noting that this is already what we do for pretty\nmuch every
      other claim, including many complex structural problems: give\nthe data, draw
      a conclusion, and ask reviewers to evaluate the logic.\nArguments about where
      the burden of proof should lie are tedious and\nusually unproductive, but I
      think we should have a pretty high barrier\nto making specific methods *de jure*
      required for publication.\n\n## Commenters Who Dislike My Claim That Journals

      not trying to suggest that journals ought not to care about accuracy\nat all;
      *ceteris paribus*, accuracy should be prioritized. But given\nthat we''re all
      constrained by finite resources, it''s important to\nconsider the tradeoffs
      we''re making with every policy decision. It''s\npossible that trying to increase
      accuracy by asking for more data could\nhave deleterious consequences:\n\n>
      There''s clear extremes on both ends: requiring ^1^H NMR spectra for\n> publication
      is probably good, but requiring a crystal structure of\n> every compound would
      be ridiculous.\n\nI think it''s easiest to think about these issues in terms
      of two\nseparate questions: (1) relative to where we are today, should we push\nfor
      more accuracy in the literature or less, and (2) are we achieving\nour chosen
      degree of accuracy in the most efficient manner possible?\n\nThe first question
      is clearly complex, and probably deserves a longer\nand fuller treatment that
      I can provide here---although I''ll note that\n[others have\nespoused](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review)\n[more

      the second link). I hope to write more on this subject later.\n\nBut the second
      question seems more straightforward. Is requiring ^13^C\nNMR for every compound
      a Pareto-optimal way to ensure accuracy, as\nopposed to HSQC or HMBC? I struggle
      to see how the answer can be yes.\n", "images": [{"src": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29187aa8-5c42-412d-a0bc-a5f269ed9b4b_1184x800.png",

      wrong here! But what I\\\\'m saying makes sense to me, and (it\\nseems) to a
      lot of other people, so I think it\\\\'s at least worth having\\nthis discussion.\\n\\n##
      Commenters Who Feel ^13^C NMR Is Scientifically Crucial\\n\\nA few people pointed
      out that there are lots of instances in which\\ncarbon NMR *is* very important\\n([1](https://twitter.com/MuhammadAdilSA/status/1603339486431416320),\\n[2](https://twitter.com/craigdc1983/status/1603300877208621056),\\n[3](https://twitter.com/Double_Anne_/status/1603358363580088320),\\n[4](https://twitter.com/BogdosMichael/status/1603413304885612545),\\n[5](https://twitter.com/OscarErlenmeyer/status/1603521689635414019)).
      I\\ndon\\\\'t disagree with this at all; I\\\\'ve also used ^13^C NMR to solve\\nproblems
      that ^1^H NMR and mass spectrometry alone couldn\\\\'t solve! But\\njust because
      it's crucial sometimes doesn't mean it's crucial all the\\ntime. Does anyone
      really think that you need carbon NMR to tell if Boc\\nprotection of a primary
      amine worked?\\n\\nMost of the reactions that people do---especially people
      for whom\\nsynthetic chemistry is a means and not an end---are [pretty\\nstraightforward](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409),\\nsuch
      that I think it's fair to assume you could deduce the correct\\nproduct with
      high confidence without ^13^C NMR. (Again, if carbon\\nspectra were so crucial,
      it wouldn't be the case that many people don't\\nget them until the very end
      of the project.)\\n\\n## Commenters Who Feel That It\\\\'s Important To Have

      monster in pyridine-d5 to see my last\\nquat)</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nI\\\\'ve
      heard this from plenty of people before, and it\\\\'s true that\\nsometimes
      it\\\\'s not hard at all to get a nice carbon spectrum! But\\nsometimes it *is*
      really hard, also. Based on the other responses, it\\nseems like lots of other
      people agree with this sentiment.\\n\\n(Is it possible that some of this disagreement
      reflects whether one has\\naccess to a helium cryoprobe?)\\n\\n## Commenters
      Who Feel It\\\\'s Important To Have Consistent Journal Standards\\n\\nA few
      people pointed out that making carbon NMR necessary on a\\ncase-by-case basis
      would be burdensome for editors and reviewers, since\\nthey\\\\'d have to think
      through each case themselves\\n([1](https://twitter.com/Double_Anne_/status/1603358846734548992),\\n[2](https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/1603471344468840448)).
      This is a\\nfair point, and one I don\\\\'t have a good response to.\\n\\nHowever,
      it\\\\'s worth noting that this is already what we do for pretty\\nmuch every
      other claim, including many complex structural problems: give\\nthe data, draw
      a conclusion, and ask reviewers to evaluate the logic.\\nArguments about where
      the burden of proof should lie are tedious and\\nusually unproductive, but I
      think we should have a pretty high barrier\\nto making specific methods *de
      jure* required for publication.\\n\\n## Commenters Who Dislike My Claim That
      Journals Could Permit More Errors\\n\\nI\\\\'m going to highlight [Dan\\nSingleton](https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1603441344747388929)\\nhere,

      thread goes on, obviously, and is worth\\nreading.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nI'm
      not trying to suggest that journals ought not to care about accuracy\\nat all;
      *ceteris paribus*, accuracy should be prioritized. But given\\nthat we're all
      constrained by finite resources, it's important to\\nconsider the tradeoffs
      we're making with every policy decision. It's\\npossible that trying to increase
      accuracy by asking for more data could\\nhave deleterious consequences:\\n\\n>
      There's clear extremes on both ends: requiring ^1^H NMR spectra for\\n> publication
      is probably good, but requiring a crystal structure of\\n> every compound would
      be ridiculous.\\n\\nI think it's easiest to think about these issues in terms
      of two\\nseparate questions: (1) relative to where we are today, should we push\\nfor
      more accuracy in the literature or less, and (2) are we achieving\\nour chosen
      degree of accuracy in the most efficient manner possible?\\n\\nThe first question
      is clearly complex, and probably deserves a longer\\nand fuller treatment that
      I can provide here---although I'll note that\\n[others have\\nespoused](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review)\\n[more
      radical\\npositions](https://www.liamkofibright.com/uploads/4/8/9/8/48985425/is_peer_review_a_good_idea_.pdf)\\nthan
      mine on peer review (h/t [Michael\\nBogdos](https://twitter.com/BogdosMichael/status/1603413314868060160)\\nfor
      the second link). I hope to write more on this subject later.\\n\\nBut the second
      question seems more straightforward. Is requiring ^13^C\\nNMR for every compound
      a Pareto-optimal way to ensure accuracy, as\\nopposed to HSQC or HMBC? I struggle
      to see how the answer can be yes.\\n\",\"relationships\":[],\"archive_url\":null,\"guid\":\"114373968\",\"updated\":false,\"category\":\"chemicalSciences\",\"abstract\":null,\"status\":\"active\"}]"

      that ^1^H NMR and mass spectrometry alone couldn\\\\'t solve! But\\njust because
      it's crucial sometimes doesn't mean it's crucial all the\\ntime. Does anyone
      really think that you need carbon NMR to tell if Boc\\nprotection of a primary
      amine worked?\\n\\nMost of the reactions that people do---especially people
      for whom\\nsynthetic chemistry is a means and not an end---are [pretty\\nstraightforward](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01409),\\nsuch
      that I think it's fair to assume you could deduce the correct\\nproduct with
      high confidence without ^13^C NMR. (Again, if carbon\\nspectra were so crucial,
      it wouldn't be the case that many people don't\\nget them until the very end
      of the project.)\\n\\n## Commenters Who Feel That It\\\\'s Important To Have

      is, generally speaking, a huge waste of time.\n\nThis isn''t meant to be an
      attack on carbon NMR as a scientific tool;\nit''s an excellent technique, and
      gives structural information that no\nother methods can. Rather, I take issue
      with the requirement that the\nidentity of every published compound be verified
      with a ^13^C NMR\nspectrum.\n\nVery few ^13^C NMR experiments yield unanticipated
      results. While in\nsome cases ^13^C NMR is the only reliable way to characterize
      a\nmolecule, in most cases the structural assignment is obvious from ^1^H\nNMR,
      and any ambiguity can be resolved with high-resolution mass\nspectrometry. Most
      structure determination is boring. Elucidating the\nstructure of bizarre secondary
      metabolites from sea sponges takes ^13^C\nNMR; figuring out if your amide coupling
      or click reaction worked does\nnot.\n\nThe irrelevance of ^13^C NMR can be shown
      via the doctrine of revealed\npreference: most carbon spectra are acquired only
      for publication,\nindicating that researchers are confident in their structural\nassignments
      without ^13^C NMR. It''s not uncommon for the entire project\nto be scientifically
      \"done\" before any ^13^C NMR spectra are acquired.\nIn most fields, people
      treat ^13^C NMR like a nuisance, not a scientific\ntool---the areas where this
      isn''t true, like total synthesis or sugar\nchemistry, are the areas where ^13^C
      NMR is actually useful.\n\nRequiring ^13^C NMR for publication isn''t costless.
      The low natural\nabundance of ^13^C and poor gyromagnetic ratio means that ^13^C
      NMR\nspectra are orders of magnitude more difficult to obtain than ^1^H NMR\nspectra.
      As a result, a large fraction of instrument time in any\nchemistry department
      is usually dedicated to churning out ^13^C NMR\nspectra for publication, while
      people with actual scientific problems\nare kept waiting. ^13^C NMR-induced
      demand for NMR time means\ndepartments have to buy more instruments, hire more
      staff, and use more\nresources; the costs trickle down.\n\nAnd it''s not like
      eliminating the requirement to provide ^13^C NMR\nspectra would totally upend
      the way we do chemical research. Most of our\nfield''s history, including some
      of our greatest achievements, were done\nin the age before carbon NMR---the
      first ^13^C NMR study of organic\nmolecules was done by\n[Lauterbur](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1743253)
      in 1957,\nand it would take even longer for the techniques to advance to the
      point\nwhere non-specialists could use the technique routinely. Even in the\nearly
      2000s you can find *JACS* papers without ^13^C NMR spectra in the\nSI, indicating
      that it\\''s possible to do high-quality research without\nit.\n\nWhy, then,
      do we require ^13^C NMR today? I think it stems from a\nmisguided belief that
      scientific journals should be the ultimate\narbiters of truth---that what''s
      reported in a journal ought to be\ntrustworthy and above reproach. We hope that
      by requiring enough data,\nwe can force scientists to do their science properly,
      and ferret out bad\nactors along the way. (Perhaps the clearest example of this
      mindset is\n*JOC* & *Org. Lett.*, who maintain an ever-growing [list of\nstandards](https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=joceah#data_requirements)\nfor
      chemical data aimed at requiring all work to be high quality.) Our\nimpulse
      to require more and more data flows from our desire to make\nscience an institution,
      a vast repository of knowledge equipped to\ncombat the legions of misinformation.\n\nBut
      this hasn''t always been the role of science. Geoff Anders, [writing\nfor](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)\n*[Palladium](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)*,\ndescribes
      how modern science began as an explicitly anti-authoritative\nenterprise:\n\n>
      Boyle maintained that it was possible to base all knowledge of nature\n> on
      personal observation, thereby eliminating a reliance on the\n> authority of
      others. He further proposed that if there were\n> differences of opinion, they
      could be resolved by experiments which\n> would yield observations confirming
      or denying those opinions. The\n> idea that one would rely on one''s own observations
      rather than those\n> of others was enshrined in the motto of the Royal Society---*nullius\n>
      in verba*.\n\n*nullius in verba* translates to \"take no one''s word for it,\"
      not\nexactly a ringing endorsement of science as institutional authority.\nThis
      same theme can be found in more recent history. Melinda Baldwin''s\n*[Making\nNature](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)*\nrecounts

      not that peer review is bad, or that\nscientific authority is bad, but that
      the goal of enforcing accuracy in\nthe scientific literature is a new one, and
      perhaps harder to achieve\nthan we think. There are problems in the scientific
      literature\neverywhere, big and small. John Ioannidis memorably claimed that
      [\"most\npublished findings are\nfalse,\"](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)\nand
      while chemistry may not suffer from the same issues as the social\nsciences,
      we have our own problems. [Elemental analysis doesn''t\nwork](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00325),
      [integration\ngrids cause\nproblems](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74474ee301c02d6c7916e),\nand
      even [reactions from famous labs can''t be\nreplicated](http://blog-syn.blogspot.com/2013/02/blog-syn-003-benzylic-oxidation-of_18.html).\nBased
      on this, we might conclude that we''re very, very far from making\nscience a
      robust repository of truth.\n\nNevertheless, progress marches on. A few misassigned
      compounds here and\nthere don''t cause too many problems, any more than a faulty
      elemental\nanalysis report or a sketchy DFT study. Scientific research itself
      has\nmechanisms for error correction: anyone who''s ever tried to reproduce
      a\nreaction has engaged in one such mechanism. Robust reactions get used,\ncited,
      and amplified, while reactions that never work slowly fade into\nobscurity.
      Indeed, despite all of the above failures, we''re living\nthrough a golden age
      for our field.\n\nGiven that we will never be able to eradicate bad data completely,
      the\nnormative question then becomes \"how hard should we try?\" In an age of\n[declining
      research\nproductivity](https://www.agrarheute.com/sites/agrarheute.com/files/2020-01/innovation_scientific_progress.pdf),\nwe
      should be mindful not only of the dangers of low standards\n(proliferation of
      bad work) but also of the dangers of high standards\n(making projects take way
      longer). There''s clear extremes on both ends:\nrequiring ^1^H NMR spectra for
      publication is probably good, but\nrequiring a crystal structure of every compound
      would be ridiculous. The\nclaim I hope to make here is that requiring ^13^C
      NMR for every compound\ndoes more to slow down good work than it does to prevent
      bad work, and\nthus should be abandoned.\n\n*Update 12/16/2022: see [some followup\nremarks](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/blog/20221216_carbon_nmr_response.html)\nbased

      NMR is, generally speaking, a huge waste of time.\\n\\nThis isn't meant to be
      an attack on carbon NMR as a scientific tool;\\nit's an excellent technique,
      and gives structural information that no\\nother methods can. Rather, I take
      issue with the requirement that the\\nidentity of every published compound be
      verified with a ^13^C NMR\\nspectrum.\\n\\nVery few ^13^C NMR experiments yield
      unanticipated results. While in\\nsome cases ^13^C NMR is the only reliable
      way to characterize a\\nmolecule, in most cases the structural assignment is
      obvious from ^1^H\\nNMR, and any ambiguity can be resolved with high-resolution
      mass\\nspectrometry. Most structure determination is boring. Elucidating the\\nstructure
      of bizarre secondary metabolites from sea sponges takes ^13^C\\nNMR; figuring
      out if your amide coupling or click reaction worked does\\nnot.\\n\\nThe irrelevance
      of ^13^C NMR can be shown via the doctrine of revealed\\npreference: most carbon
      spectra are acquired only for publication,\\nindicating that researchers are
      confident in their structural\\nassignments without ^13^C NMR. It's not uncommon
      for the entire project\\nto be scientifically \\\"done\\\" before any ^13^C
      NMR spectra are acquired.\\nIn most fields, people treat ^13^C NMR like a nuisance,
      not a scientific\\ntool---the areas where this isn't true, like total synthesis
      or sugar\\nchemistry, are the areas where ^13^C NMR is actually useful.\\n\\nRequiring
      ^13^C NMR for publication isn't costless. The low natural\\nabundance of ^13^C
      and poor gyromagnetic ratio means that ^13^C NMR\\nspectra are orders of magnitude
      more difficult to obtain than ^1^H NMR\\nspectra. As a result, a large fraction
      of instrument time in any\\nchemistry department is usually dedicated to churning
      out ^13^C NMR\\nspectra for publication, while people with actual scientific
      problems\\nare kept waiting. ^13^C NMR-induced demand for NMR time means\\ndepartments
      have to buy more instruments, hire more staff, and use more\\nresources; the
      costs trickle down.\\n\\nAnd it's not like eliminating the requirement to provide
      ^13^C NMR\\nspectra would totally upend the way we do chemical research. Most
      of our\\nfield's history, including some of our greatest achievements, were
      done\\nin the age before carbon NMR---the first ^13^C NMR study of organic\\nmolecules
      was done by\\n[Lauterbur](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1743253) in
      1957,\\nand it would take even longer for the techniques to advance to the point\\nwhere
      non-specialists could use the technique routinely. Even in the\\nearly 2000s
      you can find *JACS* papers without ^13^C NMR spectra in the\\nSI, indicating
      that it\\\\'s possible to do high-quality research without\\nit.\\n\\nWhy, then,
      do we require ^13^C NMR today? I think it stems from a\\nmisguided belief that
      scientific journals should be the ultimate\\narbiters of truth---that what's
      reported in a journal ought to be\\ntrustworthy and above reproach. We hope
      that by requiring enough data,\\nwe can force scientists to do their science
      properly, and ferret out bad\\nactors along the way. (Perhaps the clearest example
      of this mindset is\\n*JOC* & *Org. Lett.*, who maintain an ever-growing [list
      of\\nstandards](https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=joceah#data_requirements)\\nfor
      chemical data aimed at requiring all work to be high quality.) Our\\nimpulse
      to require more and more data flows from our desire to make\\nscience an institution,
      a vast repository of knowledge equipped to\\ncombat the legions of misinformation.\\n\\nBut
      this hasn't always been the role of science. Geoff Anders, [writing\\nfor](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)\\n*[Palladium](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)*,\\ndescribes
      how modern science began as an explicitly anti-authoritative\\nenterprise:\\n\\n>
      Boyle maintained that it was possible to base all knowledge of nature\\n> on
      personal observation, thereby eliminating a reliance on the\\n> authority of
      others. He further proposed that if there were\\n> differences of opinion, they
      could be resolved by experiments which\\n> would yield observations confirming
      or denying those opinions. The\\n> idea that one would rely on one's own observations
      rather than those\\n> of others was enshrined in the motto of the Royal Society---*nullius\\n>
      in verba*.\\n\\n*nullius in verba* translates to \\\"take no one's word for
      it,\\\" not\\nexactly a ringing endorsement of science as institutional authority.\\nThis
      same theme can be found in more recent history. Melinda Baldwin's\\n*[Making\\nNature](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)*\\nrecounts
      how peer review---a now-core part of scientific\\npublishing---became commonplace

      NMR is, generally speaking, a huge waste of time.\\n\\nThis isn't meant to be
      an attack on carbon NMR as a scientific tool;\\nit's an excellent technique,
      and gives structural information that no\\nother methods can. Rather, I take
      issue with the requirement that the\\nidentity of every published compound be
      verified with a ^13^C NMR\\nspectrum.\\n\\nVery few ^13^C NMR experiments yield
      unanticipated results. While in\\nsome cases ^13^C NMR is the only reliable
      way to characterize a\\nmolecule, in most cases the structural assignment is
      obvious from ^1^H\\nNMR, and any ambiguity can be resolved with high-resolution
      mass\\nspectrometry. Most structure determination is boring. Elucidating the\\nstructure
      of bizarre secondary metabolites from sea sponges takes ^13^C\\nNMR; figuring
      out if your amide coupling or click reaction worked does\\nnot.\\n\\nThe irrelevance
      of ^13^C NMR can be shown via the doctrine of revealed\\npreference: most carbon
      spectra are acquired only for publication,\\nindicating that researchers are
      confident in their structural\\nassignments without ^13^C NMR. It's not uncommon
      for the entire project\\nto be scientifically \\\"done\\\" before any ^13^C
      NMR spectra are acquired.\\nIn most fields, people treat ^13^C NMR like a nuisance,
      not a scientific\\ntool---the areas where this isn't true, like total synthesis
      or sugar\\nchemistry, are the areas where ^13^C NMR is actually useful.\\n\\nRequiring
      ^13^C NMR for publication isn't costless. The low natural\\nabundance of ^13^C
      and poor gyromagnetic ratio means that ^13^C NMR\\nspectra are orders of magnitude
      more difficult to obtain than ^1^H NMR\\nspectra. As a result, a large fraction
      of instrument time in any\\nchemistry department is usually dedicated to churning
      out ^13^C NMR\\nspectra for publication, while people with actual scientific
      problems\\nare kept waiting. ^13^C NMR-induced demand for NMR time means\\ndepartments
      have to buy more instruments, hire more staff, and use more\\nresources; the
      costs trickle down.\\n\\nAnd it's not like eliminating the requirement to provide
      ^13^C NMR\\nspectra would totally upend the way we do chemical research. Most
      of our\\nfield's history, including some of our greatest achievements, were
      done\\nin the age before carbon NMR---the first ^13^C NMR study of organic\\nmolecules
      was done by\\n[Lauterbur](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1743253) in
      1957,\\nand it would take even longer for the techniques to advance to the point\\nwhere
      non-specialists could use the technique routinely. Even in the\\nearly 2000s
      you can find *JACS* papers without ^13^C NMR spectra in the\\nSI, indicating
      that it\\\\'s possible to do high-quality research without\\nit.\\n\\nWhy, then,
      do we require ^13^C NMR today? I think it stems from a\\nmisguided belief that
      scientific journals should be the ultimate\\narbiters of truth---that what's
      reported in a journal ought to be\\ntrustworthy and above reproach. We hope
      that by requiring enough data,\\nwe can force scientists to do their science
      properly, and ferret out bad\\nactors along the way. (Perhaps the clearest example
      of this mindset is\\n*JOC* & *Org. Lett.*, who maintain an ever-growing [list
      of\\nstandards](https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=joceah#data_requirements)\\nfor
      chemical data aimed at requiring all work to be high quality.) Our\\nimpulse
      to require more and more data flows from our desire to make\\nscience an institution,
      a vast repository of knowledge equipped to\\ncombat the legions of misinformation.\\n\\nBut
      this hasn't always been the role of science. Geoff Anders, [writing\\nfor](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)\\n*[Palladium](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)*,\\ndescribes
      how modern science began as an explicitly anti-authoritative\\nenterprise:\\n\\n>
      Boyle maintained that it was possible to base all knowledge of nature\\n> on
      personal observation, thereby eliminating a reliance on the\\n> authority of
      others. He further proposed that if there were\\n> differences of opinion, they
      could be resolved by experiments which\\n> would yield observations confirming
      or denying those opinions. The\\n> idea that one would rely on one's own observations
      rather than those\\n> of others was enshrined in the motto of the Royal Society---*nullius\\n>
      in verba*.\\n\\n*nullius in verba* translates to \\\"take no one's word for
      it,\\\" not\\nexactly a ringing endorsement of science as institutional authority.\\nThis
      same theme can be found in more recent history. Melinda Baldwin's\\n*[Making\\nNature](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-making-nature)*\\nrecounts
      how peer review---a now-core part of scientific\\npublishing---became commonplace
      at *Nature* only in the 1970s. In the\\n1990s it was still common to publish
      organic chemistry papers without\\nsupporting information.\\n\\n::: {.captioned-image-container}\\n<figure>\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26584d03-b8de-4ed0-a82d-52398bfd3aba_1500x1000.jpeg\\\"\\nclass=\\\"image-link
