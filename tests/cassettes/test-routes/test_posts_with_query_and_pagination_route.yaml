        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"\",\"tags\":[\"Research

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal

        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        1498w\\\" />At the same time it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers
        take to share information to make sure they can publish in the highest IF
        journals. It can add up to years if they submit to one after another journal
        with a successively lower jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible.
        Though, I seriously doubt the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features

        According<a href=\\\"https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212\\\">
        to this article</a>, \\\"the access to subscribed content only works for libraries

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim

        most significant piece of published research in recent history? One strong
        candidate is a paper called \u201CIleal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific
        colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children\u201D published
        in 1998. It was written by Andrew Wakefield et al., and postulated a link
        between the MMR vaccine and autism. This article became the launching point
        for the anti-vax movement, which has resulted in (among other things) 142,000
        deaths from measles in 2019 alone. It has also contributed to the general
        decline of trust in expertise and the rise of fake news.</p>\\n<p>This article
        is now recognised as \u201Cnot just poor science, [but] outright fraud\u201D
        (BMJ). It was eventually retracted \u2014 but it did take its venue of publication
        12 years to do so. Where did it appear? In <em>The Lancet</em>, one of the
        world&#8217;s most established and prestigious medical journals, its prestige
        quantified by a stellar Impact Factor of 59.1.</p>\\n<p>How could such a terrible
        paper be published by such a respected journal? Because the venue of its publication
        tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Retractions
        from prestigious venues are not restricted to rogues like Wakefield. Last
        month, Nobel Prize winner Frances Arnold said she was \u201Cbummed\u201D to
        have to retract her 2019 paper on enzymatic synthesis of beta-lactams because
        the results were not reproducible. \u201CCareful examination of the first
        author&#8217;s lab notebook then revealed missing contemporaneous entries
        and raw data for key experiments.\u201D she explained. I.e. \u201Coops, we
        prepared the paper sloppily, sooorry!\u201D</p>\\n<p>Prof. Arnold is the first
        woman to be elected to all three National Academies in the USA and has been
        lauded by institutions as diverse as the White House, BBC and the Vatican.
        She even appeared as herself in the TV series, Big Bang Theory. She received
        widespread praise for being so open about having to retract this work \u2014
        yet what does it say of the paper\u2019s venue of publication, <em>Science</em>?
        Plainly the quality of this paper was not in the least assured by its venue
        of publication. Or to put it another way, the venue of its publication tells
        us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>If we\u2019re going
        to talk about high- and low-prestige venues, we\u2019ll need a ranking system
        of some sort. The obvious ranking system is the Impact Factor \u2014 which,
        as Clarivate says \u201Ccan be used to provide a gross approximation of the
        prestige of journals\u201D. Love it or hate it, the IF has become ubiquitous,
        and we will reluctantly use it here as a proxy for journal prestige.</p>\\n<p>So,
        then: what does \u201Cquality\u201D really mean for a research paper? And
        how does it relate to journal prestige?</p>\\n<p>One answer would be that
        a paper\u2019s quality is to do with its methodological soundness: adherence
        to best practices that make its findings reliable and reproducible. One important
        aspect of this is statistical power: are enough observations made, and are
        the correlations significant enough and strong enough for the results to carry
        weight? We would hope that all reputable journals would consider this crucially
        important. Yet Brembs et al. (2013) found no association between statistical
        power and journal impact factor. So it seems the venue of its publication
        tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Or perhaps
        we can define \u201Cquality\u201D operationally, something like how frequently
        a paper is cited \u2014 more being good, less being less good, right?. Astonishingly,
        given that Impact Factor is derived from citation counts, Lozano et al. (2012)
        showed that citation count of an individual paper is correlated only very
        weakly with the Impact Factor of the journal it\u2019s published in \u2014
        and that correlation has been growing yet weaker since 1990, as the rise of
        the WWW has made discovery of papers easier irrespective of their venue. In
        other words, the venue of its publication tells us nothing useful about the
        quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>We might at this point ask ourselves whether
        there is <em>any</em> measurable aspect of individual papers that correlates
        strongly with the Impact Factor of the journal they appear in. There is: Fang
        et al. (2012) showed that Impact Factor has a highly significant correlation
        with the number of retractions for fraud or suspected fraud. Wakefield\u2019s
        paper has been cited 3336 times \u2014 did the Lancet know what it was doing
        by delaying this paper\u2019s retraction for so long?<sup>[1]</sup> So maybe
        the venue of its publication does tell us something about the quality of a
        paper!</p>\\n<p>Imagine if we asked 1000 random scholars to rank journals
        on an \u201Cdegree of excellence\u201D scale. <em>Science</em> and <em>The
        Lancet</em> would, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree \u2014 like Liverpool\u2019s
        football team or that one from the \u201Cgreat state of Kansas\u201D recently
        celebrated by Trump \u2014 be placed in the journal Premier League. Yet the
        evidence shows \u2014 both from anecdote and hard data \u2014 that papers
        published in these venues are at least as vulnerable to error, poor experimental
        design and even outright fraud as those in less exalted venues.</p>\\n<p>But
        let\u2019s look beyond journals \u2014 perhaps we\u2019ll find a link between
        quality and venue elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019d like to tell you two stories
        about another venue of publication, this time, the World Bank.</p>\\n<p>In
        2016, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $5BN to fight AIDS in
        Africa. Why? Well, it was all down to someone at the World Bank having the
        bright idea to take a copy of their latest report on AIDS in Africa to Seattle
        and pitch the findings and recommendations directly to Mr Gates. I often tell
        this story as an example of impact. I think we can agree that the quality
        of this report must have been pretty high. After all, it unlocked $5BN for
        a good cause. But, of course, you\u2019re thinking \u2014 D&#8217;oh! It\u2019s
        a World Bank report, it must be high-quality. Really?</p>\\n<p>Consider also
        this story: in 2014, headlines like this lit up around the world: \u201CLiterally
        a Third of World Bank Policy Reports Have Never, Ever Been Read Online, By
        Anyone\u201D (<em>Slate</em>) and \u201CWorld Bank learns most PDFs it produces
        go unread\u201D (<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>). These headlines were triggered
        by a working paper, written by two economists from the World Bank and published
        on its website. The punchline? They were wrong, the paper was very wrong.
        Like Prof. Arnold\u2019s paper they were \u201Cmissing contemporaneous entries
        and raw data\u201D, in this case data from the World Bank\u2019s official
        repository. They\u2019d pulled the data from an old repository. If they had
        also used data from the Bank\u2019s new repository they\u2019d have found
        that every Bank report, however niche, had been downloaded many times. How
        do I know? Because I called the one guy who would know the truth, the Bank\u2019s
        Publisher, Carlos Rossel, and once he\u2019d calmed down, he told me.</p>\\n<p>So,
        we have two reports from the same venue: one plainly exhibiting a degree of
        excellence, the other painfully embarrassing (and, by the way, it still hasn\u2019t
        been retracted).</p>\\n<p>Now, I bet you\u2019re thinking, the latter is a
        working paper, therefore it hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed and so it doesn\u2019t
        count. Well, the Aids in Africa report wasn\u2019t &#8220;peer reviewed&#8221;
        either \u2014 in the sense we all understand \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop
        Gates reaching for his Foundation\u2019s wallet. What about all the preprints
        being posted on BiorXiv and elsewhere about the Coronavirus: do they \u201Cnot
        count\u201D? This reminds me of a lovely headline when Cern\u2019s paper on
        the discovery of the Higgs Boson finally made it into a journal some months
        after the results had been revealed at a packed seminar, and weeks after the
        paper had been posted on arXiv: \u201CHiggs boson discovery passes peer review,
        becomes actual science\u201D. Quite apart from the irony expressed by the
        headline writer, here\u2019s a puzzler for you. Was the quality of this paper
        assured by finally being published in a journal (with an impact factor one-tenth
        of <em>Science</em>\u2019s), or when it was posted in arXiv, or when it was
        presented at a seminar? Which venue assured the quality of this work?</p>\\n<p>Of
        course, none of them did because the venue of its publication tells us nothing
        about the quality of the paper. The quality is inherent in the paper itself,
        not in the venue where it is made public.</p>\\n<p>Wakefield paper\u2019s
        lack of quality was also inherent in the paper itself and that it was published
        in <em>The Lancet</em> (and is still available on more than seventy websites)
        did not mean it was high quality. Or to put it another way, the venue of its
        publication tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>So
        what are different venues good for? Today\u2019s scholarly publishing system
        is still essentially the same as the one that Oldenburg et al started in the
        17th Century. This system evolved in an environment when publishing costs
        were significant and grew with increased dissemination (increased demand meant
        higher print and delivery costs). This meant that editors had to make choices
        to keep costs under control \u2014 to select what to publish and what to reject.
        The selection criteria varied: some used geography to segment the market (<em>The
        Chinese Journal of X</em>, <em>The European Journal of Y</em>); some set up
        societies (<em>Operational Research Society Journal</em>) and others segmented
        the market by discipline (<em>The International Journal of Neurology</em>).
        These were genuinely useful distinctions to make, helping guide authors, readers
        and librarians to solutions for their authoring, reading and archiving needs.</p>\\n<p>Most
        journals pretend to use quality as a criterion to select within their niche
        \u2014 but isn\u2019t it funny that there isn\u2019t a <em>Quality Journal
        of Chemistry</em> or a <em>Higher-Quality Journal of Physics</em>? The real
        reasons for selection and rejection are of course to do with building brands
        and meeting business targets in terms of the number of pages published. If
        quality was the overarching criteria, why, like the wine harvest, don\u2019t
        journals fluctuate in output each year? Down when there\u2019s a poor-season
        and up when the sun shines?</p>\\n<p>If quality was the principle reason for
        acceptance and rejection, why is it absent from the list of most common reasons
        for rejection? According to Editage one of the most common reasons is because
        the paper didn\u2019t fit the aims and scope of the journal. Not because the
        paper is of poor quality. The current publishing process isn\u2019t a system
        for weeding out weak papers from prestige journals, leaving them with only
        the best. It\u2019s a system for sorting stuff into &#8220;houses&#8221; which
        is as opaque, unaccountable and random as the Sorting Hat which confronted
        Harry Potter at Hogwarts. This paper to the <em>Journal of Hufflepuff</em>;
        that one to the <em>Journal of Slytherin</em>!</p>\\n<p>So the venue of its
        publication can tell us useful things about a paper: its geographical origin,
        its field of study, the society that endorses it. The one thing it can\u2019t
        tell us is anything useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<h1>Note</h1>\\n<p>[1]
        We regret this phrasing. We asked &#8220;did the Lancet know what it was doing&#8221;
        in the usual colloquial sense of implying a lack of competence (&#8220;he
        doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing&#8221;); but as Niall Boyce rightly
        pointed out, it can be read as snidely implying that <em>The Lancet</em> knew
        <em>exactly</em> what it was doing, and deliberately delayed the retraction
        in order to accumulate more citations. For avoidance of doubt, that is not
        what we meant; we apologise for not having written more clearly.</p>\\n<h1>References</h1>\\n<p>We
        were of course not able to give references during the debate. But since our
        statement included several citations, we can remedy that deficiency here.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

        with the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.abstract\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">highest
        retraction rates</a>), <em><a href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/\\\"

        initiative</a> in attempting to do something about this through building platforms
        and procedures to assist and reward authors who are keen on their work being
        reproducible and actually used. The <a href=\\\"http://usegalaxy.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">Galaxy community</a> is one that shares similar goals,
        with a computational platform which allows users to share workflows, histories
        and wrapped tools in an easy-to-use and open source interface that even people
        without coding experience can use. On top of our <a href=\\\"gigadb.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">GigaDB repository</a> to host large scale datasets,
        we have also set up our own Galaxy server called <a href=\\\"http://galaxy.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/\\\"

        a <a href=\\\"http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2013/04/05/call-for-papers-for-a-special-gcc2013-galaxy-series/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">call for papers</a> for a special thematic focused series
        on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows. The initial results
        of this are now available, with the first two papers just out and available
        from the <a href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">new
        series page</a>. Whilst the series considers best practice papers, discussion,
        as well as novel uses of Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy
        toolkits, with a <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">genome diversity tool collection</a> presented from

        target=\\\"_blank\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br
        />\\nFollowing on from our experiences allocating <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">DOIs</a> to software from papers, we helped lobby <a
        href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DataCite</a> to
        include \u201Cworkflow\u201D as a similar resource type, and they have now

        Presenting a handy toolkit covering a number of popular population genetics
        tools, the paper provides diverse examples of their application on the genetics
        of Lemurs, and Canines and Cave Bears (oh my!). Seven of these examples are
        viewable on our <a href=\\\"http://galaxy.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/u/gigascience/g/obedoyareina2013\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\">main Galaxy server</a> and the authors website, the
        <em>GigaScience</em> Galaxy server provides access to static versions of the
        tools used within the examples of the paper. To make it a little more interactive
        and understandable for users, we have produced SVG graphs to help visualize
        how input datasets, workflows and histories are related to each example analysis.</p>\\n<p><a
