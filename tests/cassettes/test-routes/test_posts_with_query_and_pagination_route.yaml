        the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored\\\">last</a>
        \u201CScience Weekly\u201D podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_
        At about 20:29 into the episode, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\\\">Hannah
        Devlin</a> asked, whether the reason \u2018top\u2019 journals retract more
        articles may be because of increased scrutiny there.</p>\\n<p>The underlying
        assumption is very reasonable, as many more eyes see each paper in such journals
        and the motivation to shoot down such high-profile papers might also be higher.
        However, the question has actually been addressed in the scientific literature
        and the data don\u2019t seem to support this assumption. For one, <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">this figure</a> shows that there are a lot of retractions
        from lower ranking journals, but the journals who retract a lot are few and
        far between. In fact, there are many more retractions in low-ranking journals
        than in high-ranking ones. Of the high-ranking journals, a much larger proportion
        also retracts many papers. However, this analysis only shows that there are
        many more retractions in lower journals than in higher journals on an absolute
        level. Hence, these data are not conclusive, but suggestive that scrutiny
        is not really all that much higher for the \u2018top\u2019 journals than anywhere
        else.</p>\\n<p>Another reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in
        \u2018top\u2019 journals is that readership is higher, leading to more potential
        for error detection. However, the same reasoning can be applied to citations,
        and not only retractions. Moreover, citing a \u2018top\u2019 paper is not
        only easier than forcing a retraction, it also benefits your own research
        by elevating the perceived importance of your field. Thus, if readership had
        any such influence, one would expect journal rank to correlate better with
        citations than with retractions. The opposite is the case: The coefficient
        of determination for citations with journal rank currently lies around 0.2,
        while that coefficient comes to lie at just under 0.8 for retractions and
        journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig. 1D, respectively, <a href=\\\"https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full\\\">here</a>).
        So while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the evidence
        seems to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there is one at
        all.</p>\\n<p>Conversely, there is quite solid evidence that the methodology
        in \u2018top\u2019 journals is not any better than in other journals, when
        analyzing non-retracted articles. In fact, there are studies showing that
        the methodology is actually <em>worse</em> in \u2018top\u2019 journals, while
        we have not found a single study suggesting the methodology gets better with
        journal rank. Our <a href=\\\"https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full\\\">article</a>
        reviews these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern non-retracted
        papers, i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.</p>\\n<p>In conclusion,
        the evidence suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible factor in the correlation
        of journal rank and retractions, while increased incidence of fraud and lower
        methodological standards can be shown.</p>\\n<p>I know <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/\\\">Ivan
        Oransky</a>, who was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may
        have been a bit unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature
        Magazine) got to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay these
        data out. In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has twice refused
        publishing them. The first time when we submitted our manuscript, with the
        statement, that Nature had already published articles that stated that <a
        href=\\\"https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk\\\">Nature
        publishes the worst science</a>. The second time was when Cori Lok interviewed
        Jon Tennant and he told her about the data, but Cori <a href=\\\"https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data\\\">failed
        to include this part</a> of the interview. There is thus a record of Nature,
        very understandably, avoiding to admit their failure to select for solid science.
        Phillip Campbell\u2019s answer to the question in the podcast may have been
        at least the third time.</p>\\n<p>While Phillip Campbell did admit they don\u2019t
        do enough fraud-detection (it is too rare), the issue of reliability in science
        goes far beyond fraud, so successfully derailing the question towards this
        direction served his company quite well. Clearly, he\u2019s a clever guy and
        did not come unprepared.</p>\\n<p>Finally, one may ask: why do the \u2018top\u2019
        journals publish unreliable science?</p>\\n<p>Probably the most important
        factor is that they attract \u201Ctoo good to be true\u201D results, but only
        apply \u201Cpeer-review light\u201D: rejection rates drop dramatically from
        92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past the editors, that\u2019s
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah Gray and Henry Gee, pers.
        comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers know the editor wants to publish
        this paper. Second, they have an automatic conflict of interest, as a Nature
        paper in their field increases the visibility of their field, they may even
        be cited in the paper \u2013 or plan to cite it in their upcoming grant application.</p>\\n<p>On
        average, this entire model is just a recipe for disaster and more policing
        won\u2019t fix it. By using it, we have been setting us up for the exponential
        rise in retractions to be seen in <a href=\\\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\\\">Fig.
        1a of our paper</a>.</p>\\n<p>So, in the probably not too unlikely case that
        the topic of unreliable science should come up again, anyone can now cite
        the actual, peer-reviewed data we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief
        may have a harder time derailing the discussion and obfuscating the issues
        in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> The data suggest a combination
        of three factors leading to more retractions in \u2018top\u2019 journals:
        1. Worse methodological quality; 2. Higher incidence of fraud 3. Peer-review
        light. One would intuitively expect increased readership/scrutiny to play
        some role, but there is currently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against it.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That\u2019s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch\u2019s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [\u2026] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn\u2019t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors\u2019 will.</p>\\n<p>I don\u2019t
        know what\u2019s going on here. I agree with O\u2019Connor that \u201CIt\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)\u201D. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That\u2019s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there\u2019s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler\u2019s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of \u201Cfalse crocodiles\u201D Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn\u2019t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments \u201CThe retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name\u201D.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        think this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from
        those more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I
        can\u2019t help but suspect that something is going on here that\u2019s not
        being clearly stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is
        itself controversial, due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime?
        Is it even possible that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        colluded in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else?
        I don\u2019t know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone
        of anything). But I do know that <em>Nature</em>\u2018s vague and possibly
        misleading retraction notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency
        that we aim to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure we
        don\u2019t yet know the full story.</p>\\n<h1>References</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

        CSSE</p></div>\\n<p>At the start of the Year of the Mouse, the world is experiencing
        an outbreak of a new Coronavirus, for now, called 2019-nCoV. As of February
        4th (<a href=\\\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\\\">source
        JHU CSSE dashboard</a>)<sup>,</sup> there are 20,679 confirmed cases and 427
        fatalities. Nearly 99% of the cases have been reported in China mostly in
        Hubei Province; and all except two reported fatalities have occurred in Mainland
        China. All the initial cases came from the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei,
        in Central China, but the origin of the virus is unknown. The case fatality
        rate (fatalities/total cases, CFR), based on reported data has been declining
        from nearly 3% to 2% as more data has become available, but is less than 2%
        in China, outside of Hubei. This is considerably lower than SARS (9.6%)<sup>1</sup>
        and MERS (9-36%)<sup>2</sup></p>\\n<p>The first full-length reference genome
        for the virus was deposited in <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2\\\">GENBANK
        as NC_045512</a> by scientists at Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and referred
        to as the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus, as many of the initial cases
        were linked to a market of seafood and animals in the city of Wuhan. Multiple
        additional complete genomes have been deposited in GENBANK by the researchers
        within China and internationally including the US Centers for Disease Control
        (CDC). Additional isolates (62 in total at the time of posting) have been
        <a href=\\\"https://www.gisaid.org\\\">deposited in GISAID</a>, a public repository
        of influenza virus sequences . Variation and evolution of the virus are being
        followed by an open-sourced project tracking pathogen evolution, <a href=\\\"https://nextstrain.org/\\\">Nextstrain</a>.
        To date, the virus has shown few variable sites and low diversity.</p>\\n<div><img

        and all the current isolates found in China or other countries are very closely
        related (Figure 2). The sequence data suggests that there was a single zoonotic
        event of viral transmission into the human population. Phylogenetic analysis
        places 2019-nCoV in the sarbecovirus subgenus that includes the SARS virus.<sup>3</sup>

        respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, MERS-CoV, uses dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4;

        the clinical features of 41 infected cases, 6 of whom died, and their demographic
        and clinical features.<sup>10</sup> An estimate of 7 days from onset of symptoms
        to hospital admission was presented. The second description of 99 cases has
        also been published<sup>11</sup> along with reports documenting human-human
        transmission.<sup>3,4</sup> \_A third study of 425 cases provided an estimate
        of the mean incubation time of 5.2 days and a basic reproductive number of
        2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).<sup>11</sup> At the time of writing, current estimates
        of the case fatality rate (CFR) for 2019-nCoV are between 2 and 3 (<strong>Table
        1</strong>). However, in regions of China outside of Hubei only 11 out of
        6125 have died (0.18%). The first case report of a 35-year old male in the
        US described mild to moderate symptoms, and a virus with one one amino acid
        difference in one protein from the reference.<sup>12</sup> There has been
        considerable cooperation among international health organizations, with the
        CDC publishing the details of a <a href=\\\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/guidance-laboratories.html\\\">real-time
        PCR diagnostic test</a>, and the World Health Organization has a site for

        clinical treatment guidelines</a>.</p>\\n<p>In conclusion there is still rapid
        growth of 2019-nCoV infections in Hubei Province, with a slowly declining
        fatality rate, but much fewer deaths outside of this region. Genetic and biological
        data is being rapidly produced and disseminated allowing for the rapid development
        of diagnostic tests and development of vaccines and other therapeutics.</p>\\n<p><strong>We

        />\\n<p>\_</p>\\n<p>What is the most significant piece of published research
        in recent history? One strong candidate is a paper called \u201CIleal-lymphoid-nodular
        hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in
        children\u201D published in 1998. It was written by Andrew Wakefield et al.,
        and postulated a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This article became
        the launching point for the anti-vax movement, which has resulted in (among
        other things) 142,000 deaths from measles in 2019 alone. It has also contributed
        to the general decline of trust in expertise and the rise of fake news.</p>\\n<p>This
        article is now recognised as \u201Cnot just poor science, [but] outright fraud\u201D
        (BMJ). It was eventually retracted \u2014 but it did take its venue of publication
        12 years to do so. Where did it appear? In <em>The Lancet</em>, one of the
        world\u2019s most established and prestigious medical journals, its prestige
        quantified by a stellar Impact Factor of 59.1.</p>\\n<p>How could such a terrible
        paper be published by such a respected journal? Because the venue of its publication
        tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Retractions
        from prestigious venues are not restricted to rogues like Wakefield. Last
        month, Nobel Prize winner Frances Arnold said she was \u201Cbummed\u201D to
        have to retract her 2019 paper on enzymatic synthesis of beta-lactams because
        the results were not reproducible. \u201CCareful examination of the first
        author\u2019s lab notebook then revealed missing contemporaneous entries and
        raw data for key experiments.\u201D she explained. I.e. \u201Coops, we prepared
        the paper sloppily, sooorry!\u201D</p>\\n<p>Prof. Arnold is the first woman
        to be elected to all three National Academies in the USA and has been lauded
        by institutions as diverse as the White House, BBC and the Vatican. She even
        appeared as herself in the TV series, Big Bang Theory. She received widespread
        praise for being so open about having to retract this work \u2014 yet what
        does it say of the paper\u2019s venue of publication, <em>Science</em>? Plainly
        the quality of this paper was not in the least assured by its venue of publication.
        Or to put it another way, the venue of its publication tells us nothing useful
        about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>If we\u2019re going to talk about high-
        and low-prestige venues, we\u2019ll need a ranking system of some sort. The
        obvious ranking system is the Impact Factor \u2014 which, as Clarivate says
        \u201Ccan be used to provide a gross approximation of the prestige of journals\u201D.
        Love it or hate it, the IF has become ubiquitous, and we will reluctantly
        use it here as a proxy for journal prestige.</p>\\n<p>So, then: what does
        \u201Cquality\u201D really mean for a research paper? And how does it relate
        to journal prestige?</p>\\n<p>One answer would be that a paper\u2019s quality
        is to do with its methodological soundness: adherence to best practices that
        make its findings reliable and reproducible. One important aspect of this
        is statistical power: are enough observations made, and are the correlations
        significant enough and strong enough for the results to carry weight? We would
        hope that all reputable journals would consider this crucially important.
        Yet Brembs et al. (2013) found no association between statistical power and
        journal impact factor. So it seems the venue of its publication tells us nothing
        useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Or perhaps we can define \u201Cquality\u201D
        operationally, something like how frequently a paper is cited \u2014 more
        being good, less being less good, right?. Astonishingly, given that Impact
        Factor is derived from citation counts, Lozano et al. (2012) showed that citation
        count of an individual paper is correlated only very weakly with the Impact
        Factor of the journal it\u2019s published in \u2014 and that correlation has
        been growing yet weaker since 1990, as the rise of the WWW has made discovery
        of papers easier irrespective of their venue. In other words, the venue of
        its publication tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>We
        might at this point ask ourselves whether there is <em>any</em> measurable
        aspect of individual papers that correlates strongly with the Impact Factor
        of the journal they appear in. There is: Fang et al. (2012) showed that Impact
        Factor has a highly significant correlation with the number of retractions
        for fraud or suspected fraud. Wakefield\u2019s paper has been cited 3336 times
        \u2014 did the Lancet know what it was doing by delaying this paper\u2019s
        retraction for so long?<sup>[1]</sup> So maybe the venue of its publication
        does tell us something about the quality of a paper!</p>\\n<p>Imagine if we
        asked 1000 random scholars to rank journals on an \u201Cdegree of excellence\u201D
        scale. <em>Science</em> and <em>The Lancet</em> would, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll
        agree \u2014 like Liverpool\u2019s football team or that one from the \u201Cgreat
        state of Kansas\u201D recently celebrated by Trump \u2014 be placed in the
        journal Premier League. Yet the evidence shows \u2014 both from anecdote and
        hard data \u2014 that papers published in these venues are at least as vulnerable
        to error, poor experimental design and even outright fraud as those in less
        exalted venues.</p>\\n<p>But let\u2019s look beyond journals \u2014 perhaps
        we\u2019ll find a link between quality and venue elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019d
        like to tell you two stories about another venue of publication, this time,
        the World Bank.</p>\\n<p>In 2016, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation
        pledged $5BN to fight AIDS in Africa. Why? Well, it was all down to someone
        at the World Bank having the bright idea to take a copy of their latest report
        on AIDS in Africa to Seattle and pitch the findings and recommendations directly
        to Mr Gates. I often tell this story as an example of impact. I think we can
        agree that the quality of this report must have been pretty high. After all,
        it unlocked $5BN for a good cause. But, of course, you\u2019re thinking \u2014
        D\u2019oh! It\u2019s a World Bank report, it must be high-quality. Really?</p>\\n<p>Consider
        also this story: in 2014, headlines like this lit up around the world: \u201CLiterally
        a Third of World Bank Policy Reports Have Never, Ever Been Read Online, By
        Anyone\u201D (<em>Slate</em>) and \u201CWorld Bank learns most PDFs it produces
        go unread\u201D (<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>). These headlines were triggered
        by a working paper, written by two economists from the World Bank and published
        on its website. The punchline? They were wrong, the paper was very wrong.
        Like Prof. Arnold\u2019s paper they were \u201Cmissing contemporaneous entries
        and raw data\u201D, in this case data from the World Bank\u2019s official
        repository. They\u2019d pulled the data from an old repository. If they had
        also used data from the Bank\u2019s new repository they\u2019d have found
        that every Bank report, however niche, had been downloaded many times. How
        do I know? Because I called the one guy who would know the truth, the Bank\u2019s
        Publisher, Carlos Rossel, and once he\u2019d calmed down, he told me.</p>\\n<p>So,
        we have two reports from the same venue: one plainly exhibiting a degree of
        excellence, the other painfully embarrassing (and, by the way, it still hasn\u2019t
        been retracted).</p>\\n<p>Now, I bet you\u2019re thinking, the latter is a
        working paper, therefore it hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed and so it doesn\u2019t
        count. Well, the Aids in Africa report wasn\u2019t \u201Cpeer reviewed\u201D
        either \u2014 in the sense we all understand \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop
        Gates reaching for his Foundation\u2019s wallet. What about all the preprints
        being posted on BiorXiv and elsewhere about the Coronavirus: do they \u201Cnot
        count\u201D? This reminds me of a lovely headline when Cern\u2019s paper on
        the discovery of the Higgs Boson finally made it into a journal some months
        after the results had been revealed at a packed seminar, and weeks after the
        paper had been posted on arXiv: \u201CHiggs boson discovery passes peer review,
        becomes actual science\u201D. Quite apart from the irony expressed by the
        headline writer, here\u2019s a puzzler for you. Was the quality of this paper
        assured by finally being published in a journal (with an impact factor one-tenth
        of <em>Science</em>\u2019s), or when it was posted in arXiv, or when it was
        presented at a seminar? Which venue assured the quality of this work?</p>\\n<p>Of
        course, none of them did because the venue of its publication tells us nothing
        about the quality of the paper. The quality is inherent in the paper itself,
        not in the venue where it is made public.</p>\\n<p>Wakefield paper\u2019s
        lack of quality was also inherent in the paper itself and that it was published
        in <em>The Lancet</em> (and is still available on more than seventy websites)
        did not mean it was high quality. Or to put it another way, the venue of its
        publication tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>So
        what are different venues good for? Today\u2019s scholarly publishing system
        is still essentially the same as the one that Oldenburg et al started in the
        17th Century. This system evolved in an environment when publishing costs
        were significant and grew with increased dissemination (increased demand meant
        higher print and delivery costs). This meant that editors had to make choices
        to keep costs under control \u2014 to select what to publish and what to reject.
        The selection criteria varied: some used geography to segment the market (<em>The
        Chinese Journal of X</em>, <em>The European Journal of Y</em>); some set up
        societies (<em>Operational Research Society Journal</em>) and others segmented
        the market by discipline (<em>The International Journal of Neurology</em>).
        These were genuinely useful distinctions to make, helping guide authors, readers
        and librarians to solutions for their authoring, reading and archiving needs.</p>\\n<p>Most
        journals pretend to use quality as a criterion to select within their niche
        \u2014 but isn\u2019t it funny that there isn\u2019t a <em>Quality Journal
        of Chemistry</em> or a <em>Higher-Quality Journal of Physics</em>? The real
        reasons for selection and rejection are of course to do with building brands
        and meeting business targets in terms of the number of pages published. If
        quality was the overarching criteria, why, like the wine harvest, don\u2019t
        journals fluctuate in output each year? Down when there\u2019s a poor-season
        and up when the sun shines?</p>\\n<p>If quality was the principle reason for
        acceptance and rejection, why is it absent from the list of most common reasons
        for rejection? According to Editage one of the most common reasons is because
        the paper didn\u2019t fit the aims and scope of the journal. Not because the
        paper is of poor quality. The current publishing process isn\u2019t a system
        for weeding out weak papers from prestige journals, leaving them with only
        the best. It\u2019s a system for sorting stuff into \u201Chouses\u201D which
        is as opaque, unaccountable and random as the Sorting Hat which confronted
        Harry Potter at Hogwarts. This paper to the <em>Journal of Hufflepuff</em>;
        that one to the <em>Journal of Slytherin</em>!</p>\\n<p>So the venue of its
        publication can tell us useful things about a paper: its geographical origin,
        its field of study, the society that endorses it. The one thing it can\u2019t
        tell us is anything useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<h1>Note</h1>\\n<p>[1]
        We regret this phrasing. We asked \u201Cdid the Lancet know what it was doing\u201D
        in the usual colloquial sense of implying a lack of competence (\u201Che doesn\u2019t
        know what he\u2019s doing\u201D); but as Niall Boyce rightly pointed out,
        it can be read as snidely implying that <em>The Lancet</em> knew <em>exactly</em>
        what it was doing, and deliberately delayed the retraction in order to accumulate
        more citations. For avoidance of doubt, that is not what we meant; we apologise
        for not having written more clearly.</p>\\n<h1>References</h1>\\n<p>We were
        of course not able to give references during the debate. But since our statement
        included several citations, we can remedy that deficiency here.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a
