        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I

        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron
        hosting information of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        According<a href=\\\"https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212\\\">
        to this article</a>, \\\"the access to subscribed content only works for libraries

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        on this blog was published on August 3, 2007 (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1q\\\">Open
        access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</a>). This is post number
        465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and
        hosting location \u2013 but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few
        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available

        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features

        According<a href=\\\"https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212\\\">
        to this article</a>, \\\"the access to subscribed content only works for libraries

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">CC-BY</a>) \u2013 makes that easy.</p><p>The Jupyter

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Zenodo</a> fetches all blog posts using a search term
        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions
        and has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it.</em></p><p>The
        notebook includes this note:</p><div class=\\\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\\\"><div

        then generates a bibtex file of all 12 blog posts (easy as they all have DOIs)

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using
        both automation and manual curation using open source tools, which is a powerful

        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img
        src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey
        Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March 2023.</a></p><p>Also
        in 2023, <a href=\\\"https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/Third+Iron+2023+Product+Roadmap+Recap.pdf\\\">Third
        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        on the first Jupyter notebook using that API to generate an overlay blog post.</p><blockquote>An&nbsp;<strong>overlay

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">CC-BY</a>) \u2013 makes that easy.</p><p>The Jupyter

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Zenodo</a> fetches all blog posts using a search term
        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions
        and has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it.</em></p><p>The
        notebook includes this note:</p><div class=\\\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\\\"><div

        then generates a bibtex file of all 12 blog posts (easy as they all have DOIs)
        and generates a summary written in markdown using the title, author, blog

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using
        both automation and manual curation using open source tools, which is a powerful

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features

        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">launched a dedicated API</a>. Today I am reporting
        on the first Jupyter notebook using that API to generate an overlay blog post.</p><blockquote>An&nbsp;<strong>overlay

        type of&nbsp;open access&nbsp;academic journal, almost always an online&nbsp;electronic

        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using
        both automation and manual curation using open source tools, which is a powerful

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing

        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        Join me at ConTech Live to hear about a recent project with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open
        Credo</a> to see if we could detect unusual co-authorships in a dataset created
        by Anna Abalkina. <a href=\\\"https://www.contech.live/contech2022\\\">Sign
        up\_here!</a></p><p>Papermilling has a few definitions which you see here
        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina
        in her work. If you\u2019d like to know more, I suggest signing up for <a

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        term &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; reveals a limit of language &#8211;
        or rather it asks too much of language. It seeks a binary separation between
        &#8216;predatory&#8217; and &#8216;non-predatory&#8217; where no such separation
        can exist, ultimately illustrating more about the motivations and hidden biases
        about the accuser than the supposedly predatory journal at hand. We therefore
        need another way to conceptualise the practices that predatory publishing
        seeks to describe. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--more-->\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The limitations

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron
        hosting information of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally
        so libraries could collectively report and correct incorrect OA availabilty
        information.</a></p><p>It is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean
        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey
        Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March 2023.</a></p><p>Also
        in 2023, <a href=\\\"https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/Third+Iron+2023+Product+Roadmap+Recap.pdf\\\">Third
        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits

        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy

        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron
        hosting information of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally
        so libraries could collectively report and correct incorrect OA availabilty
        information.</a></p><p>It is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean
        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey
        Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March 2023.</a></p><p>Also
        in 2023, <a href=\\\"https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/Third+Iron+2023+Product+Roadmap+Recap.pdf\\\">Third
        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DOIs</a> to software from papers,
        we helped lobby <a title=\\\"DataCite schema\\\" href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DataCite</a> to include &#8220;workflow&#8221;

        Galaxy server provides access to static versions of the tools used within

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction
        Watch, the wonderful service tracking paper retractions turned 12 (<a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/happy-12th-birthday-retraction-watch-and-what-a-year-it-was/\\\">years

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img
        src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">genome diversity tool collection</a>

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        we helped lobby <a title=\\\"DataCite schema\\\" href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DataCite</a> to include &#8220;workflow&#8221;

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy

        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about

        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        term &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; reveals a limit of language &#8211;
        or rather it asks too much of language. It seeks a binary separation between
        &#8216;predatory&#8217; and &#8216;non-predatory&#8217; where no such separation
        can exist, ultimately illustrating more about the motivations and hidden biases
        about the accuser than the supposedly predatory journal at hand. We therefore

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there

        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend

        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible

        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t

        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay

        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        we helped lobby <a title=\\\"DataCite schema\\\" href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DataCite</a> to include &#8220;workflow&#8221;

        of feathers flying right now over <a href=\\\"http://io9.com/australian-medical-journal-in-tatters-following-editors-1702021303\\\">the
        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img
        src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">genome diversity tool collection</a>

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        we helped lobby <a title=\\\"DataCite schema\\\" href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DataCite</a> to include &#8220;workflow&#8221;

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Pernille R\xF8rth\u2019s novel bought in

        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy

        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about

        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        term &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; reveals a limit of language &#8211;
        or rather it asks too much of language. It seeks a binary separation between
        &#8216;predatory&#8217; and &#8216;non-predatory&#8217; where no such separation
        can exist, ultimately illustrating more about the motivations and hidden biases
        about the accuser than the supposedly predatory journal at hand. We therefore

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible

        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t

        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign
        the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop Tracking Science

        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s

        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        we helped lobby <a title=\\\"DataCite schema\\\" href=\\\"http://www.datacite.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DataCite</a> to include &#8220;workflow&#8221;

        of feathers flying right now over <a href=\\\"http://io9.com/australian-medical-journal-in-tatters-following-editors-1702021303\\\">the
        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction
        Watch, the wonderful service tracking paper retractions turned 12 (<a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/happy-12th-birthday-retraction-watch-and-what-a-year-it-was/\\\">years

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div
        class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gF6hWhzNB3Se9ktkzfDeyUxTJ1vCOeLcdfhT3b1vSZmk4zOoBtUf1DUsuWW2-glKiJ4apciOnHH1zhMMSgKXtM_HFfczZtb8_vGwfRbqyltjYK-ACO-bRvgCpVX8q-bUAguQVtgk\\\"

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s

        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina
        in her work. If you\u2019d like to know more, I suggest signing up for <a

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">call for papers</a> for a special
        thematic focused series on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows.
        The initial results of this are now available, with the first two papers just
        out and available from the <a title=\\\"Galaxy Series Page\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series/Galaxy\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">new series page</a>. Whilst the
        series considers best practice papers, discussion, as well as novel uses of
        Galaxy, these first papers are examples of Galaxy toolkits, with a <a title=\\\"Galaxy
        Pop Genomics paper\\\" href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-2-17\\\"

        rel=\\\"noopener\\\">set of analytical and visualisation tools for Complete
        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        Galaxy server provides access to static versions of the tools used within

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and
        hosting location \u2013 but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few
        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div
        class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gF6hWhzNB3Se9ktkzfDeyUxTJ1vCOeLcdfhT3b1vSZmk4zOoBtUf1DUsuWW2-glKiJ4apciOnHH1zhMMSgKXtM_HFfczZtb8_vGwfRbqyltjYK-ACO-bRvgCpVX8q-bUAguQVtgk\\\"

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s

        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        Genomics sequencing data</a> from the Stubbs lab at Erasmus Medical College.
        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own
        Galaxy server that can archive and present wrapped tools and workflows and
        histories from the papers.</p>\\n<p><strong>DOIs for workflows</strong><br

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay

        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div
        class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gF6hWhzNB3Se9ktkzfDeyUxTJ1vCOeLcdfhT3b1vSZmk4zOoBtUf1DUsuWW2-glKiJ4apciOnHH1zhMMSgKXtM_HFfczZtb8_vGwfRbqyltjYK-ACO-bRvgCpVX8q-bUAguQVtgk\\\"

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in

        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay

        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a

        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions

        then generates a bibtex file of all 12 blog posts (easy as they all have DOIs)

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        What differentiates this series from other traditional journals are doing
        is the focus on reproducibility, and the use of permanent DOIs and our own

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier

        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>

        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since

        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains
        subscription-contract confidentiality clauses\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2013/12/20/elseviers-david-tempest-explains-subscription-contract-confidentiality-clauses/\\\">Elsevier</a>.
        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        journal</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>overlay ejournal</strong>&nbsp;is a
        type of&nbsp;open access&nbsp;academic journal, almost always an online&nbsp;electronic
        journal&nbsp;(ejournal), that does not produce its own content, but selects
        from texts that are already freely available online.&nbsp;From <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal\\\"

        post</strong> applies the idea of an <strong>overlay journal</strong> to science
        blog posts, and the Rogue Scholar API \u2013 in combination with content that
        has an open license (<a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">CC-BY</a>) \u2013 makes that easy.</p><p>The Jupyter

        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">Zenodo</a> fetches all blog posts using a search term
        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction
        Watch</strong>, after the <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\"
        rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\">announcement in September</a> that <em>Crossref has
        acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions
        and has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it.</em></p><p>The
        notebook includes this note:</p><div class=\\\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\\\"><div

        17 blog posts included in Rogue Scholar (out of about 9,000 posts), and manual

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using
        both automation and manual curation using open source tools, which is a powerful

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        of <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAzt-iJEkvU&amp;feature=youtu.be\\\">Cody
        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        situation at the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA)</a>. The short, short
        version is that AMPCo, the company that publishes MJA, made plans to outsource
        production of the journal, and apparently some sub-editing and administrative
        functions as well, to <a title=\\\"Elsevier\u2019s David Tempest explains

        MJA&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Professor Stephen Leeder, raised concerns about
        the journal getting involved with <a title=\\\"How is it possible that Elsevier
        are still charging for copies of open-access articles?\\\" href=\\\"http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/\\\">one
        of the most ethically problematic publishing companies in existence</a>. And
        also about this having been done without consultation.</p>\\n<p>He was sacked
        for his trouble.</p>\\n<p>After Leeder was pushed out, his job was offered
        to MJA&#8217;s deputy editor, Tania Janusic. She declined, and resigned from
        the journal, as did 19 of the 20 members of the journal&#8217;s editorial
        advisory committee. (Some accounts say 18. Anyway, 90%+ of the committee is
        gone.)</p>\\n<p>When we first discussed the situation via email, Mike wrote,
        &#8220;My take is that at the present stage of the OA transition, editorial
        board resignations from journals controlled by predatory legacy publishers
        are about the most important visible steps that can be taken. Very good news
        for the world, even though it must be a mighty pain for the people involved.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Yes.
        I feel pretty bad for the people involved, but I&#8217;m hugely supportive
        of what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we can do to
        materially contribute here, beyond amplifying the signal and lending our public
        support to Leeder, Janusic, and the 19 editors who resigned. That&#8217;s
        a courageous thing to do, but no-one should have to do it. The sooner we move
        to a world where scientific results and other forms of scholarly publication
        are freely available to all, instead of under the monopolistic control of
        a handful of exploitative, hugely profitable corporations, the better.</p>\\n<p>A

        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled &#8216;Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>[T]he  profiles
        \ of  scholars  who  review  for  predatory journals tend to resemble those
        scholars who publish their research in these outlets: they tend to be young
        and inexperienced researchers who are affiliated with institutions in developing
        regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using

        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university
        hospital, I am working full-time on scholarly infrastructure, after recovering
        from the health issues I described in the last post (<a href=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/posts/i-spent-the-last-five-months-in-the-hospital\\\">I
        spent the last five months in the hospital</a>) with a focus on research data
        management.</p><p>Incidentally, August 3 saw another anniversary as Retraction

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        /></a></p>\\n<p>I was keen to read this &#8220;lab lit&#8221; novel written
        by renowned cell biologist Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I&#8217;d seen\_lots of enthusiastic
        comments about the book, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated
        to read two pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven&#8217;t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It&#8217;s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth&#8217;s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman&#8217;s, due in part to her
        25 years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book
        that I&#8217;d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is
        thought-provoking. You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated
        a certain atmosphere in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about
        the\_peer reviewers who dangle the carrot of &#8220;get this result and you
        can have a Nature paper&#8221; in front of Chloe? It&#8217;s a toxic mix and
        it&#8217;s happening in labs all over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On
        the role of Tom: one thing that is slightly underexplored is the fact that
        Tom tells Chloe that there is a competing group that could &#8216;scoop&#8217;
        her while she is rushing to finish her paper. It isn&#8217;t clear whether
        this group actually\_exists and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either
        way it is another bit\_of pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not
        so long ago a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it
        was recruiting PIs by looking\_for the &#8220;best scientific athlete&#8221;.
        I read last week that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field
        sportspeople have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping.
        The parallels are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all
        rules and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives
        are dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
        his lab:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\"

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,
        a software development consultancy here in London, on a project to see if
        we could detect unusual co-authorships using the dataset created by Anna Abalkina

        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t
