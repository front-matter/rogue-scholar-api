        big news is that <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\">Crossref
        has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and
        retractions and has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it</a>.
        I\u2019m waiting for full confirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it will be released, but this is still a great commitment of Crossref
        to the POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good for science
        and scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows about approximately
        50,000 retractions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Access to the database, for now, is via the
        Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits
        in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental metadata fields.
        The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of the latest Retraction
        Watch data at https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the cr-labs-updates entry if
        you visit a work that has data, e.g. https://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].</p>\\n\\n<p>The
        obvious question (and one that <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877\\\">was
        asked within an hour of our launch</a>) is: how can I retrieve a list of all
        retractions via the API? This is what we call a \u201Cfilter\u201D in the
        API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult to do in the Labs API. The
        Reasons\xAE that it\u2019s so difficult is because the Labs API gets its data
        by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about retractions, and then
        injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries that have retractions
        means building a separate index of all items with retractions, then fetching
        these, and paging through them with the user\u2019s requests. This gets to
        be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load, and I don\u2019t
        recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to no avail.
        So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full list of
        retractions. We\u2019ll continue to work on an API solution, but it\u2019s
        going to take us a bit longer.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, publishers: please
        continue to deposit retractions. It\u2019s really important and we need to
        end the culture of <em>shame</em> (at least for publishers) around declaring
        retractions. It is vital for the progress of science that we accurately mark
        papers that have been shown to be defective.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other important
        thing to note about all this is that, with any luck, it will help to make
        Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/\\\">in
        their announcement</a>: \u201CThat means we have achieved sustainability \u2013
        the highest priority goal for any nonprofit \u2013 for the database side of
        our operation. And the acquisition fee provides important unrestricted reserves
        that allow for breathing room and the potential for growth.\u201D It\u2019s
        really great that Crossref can contribute towards this sustainability, in
        the spirit of also improving the metadata that we can offer.</p>\\n\\n    <p><a

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">won\u2019t see a decline in their career prospects</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">winner takes all</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by
        metrics. That\u2019s where initiatives such as DORA &#8212; the </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01642-w\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400;\\\"> &#8212; come in. We need to create incentives for replication, for
        open data, and even for openly critiquing others\u2019 work if we want to
        see changes.</span></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"guid\":\"http://elephantinthelab.org/?p=923\",\"id\":\"45ac386b-7ae0-46fe-95a0-f05578391532\",\"image\":\"https://elephantinthelab.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d23d30480f358b5c72c90c39fca4a01742dacb6e_800x600.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1522057651,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"<strong>\\n</strong>\\n<strong>\\n

        has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and
        retractions and has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it</a>.
        I\u2019m waiting for full confirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it will be released, but this is still a great commitment of Crossref
        to the POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good for science
        and scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows about approximately
        50,000 retractions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Access to the database, for now, is via the
        Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits
        in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental metadata fields.
        The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of the latest Retraction
        Watch data at https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the cr-labs-updates entry if

        obvious question (and one that <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877\\\">was
        asked within an hour of our launch</a>) is: how can I retrieve a list of all
        retractions via the API? This is what we call a \u201Cfilter\u201D in the
        API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult to do in the Labs API. The
        Reasons\xAE that it\u2019s so difficult is because the Labs API gets its data
        by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about retractions, and then
        injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries that have retractions
        means building a separate index of all items with retractions, then fetching
        these, and paging through them with the user\u2019s requests. This gets to
        be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load, and I don\u2019t
        recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to no avail.
        So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full list of
        retractions. We\u2019ll continue to work on an API solution, but it\u2019s
        going to take us a bit longer.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, publishers: please
        continue to deposit retractions. It\u2019s really important and we need to
        end the culture of <em>shame</em> (at least for publishers) around declaring
        retractions. It is vital for the progress of science that we accurately mark
        papers that have been shown to be defective.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other important
        thing to note about all this is that, with any luck, it will help to make
        Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/\\\">in

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On

        that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122
        has newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The
        immediate consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals
        do not get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .
        Clarivate justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation patterns\\\"

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">won\u2019t see a decline in their career prospects</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">winner takes all</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by
        metrics. That\u2019s where initiatives such as DORA &#8212; the </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01642-w\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        400;\\\"> &#8212; come in. We need to create incentives for replication, for
        open data, and even for openly critiquing others\u2019 work if we want to
        see changes.</span></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"guid\":\"http://elephantinthelab.org/?p=923\",\"id\":\"45ac386b-7ae0-46fe-95a0-f05578391532\",\"image\":\"https://elephantinthelab.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d23d30480f358b5c72c90c39fca4a01742dacb6e_800x600.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1522057651,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"<strong>\\n</strong>\\n<strong>\\n

        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features

        to this article</a>, \\\"the access to subscribed content only works for libraries

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched in 2019, basically
        added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database data, ingested
        OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to [ThirdIron hosting information
        of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally so libraries could

        is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean Library, Libkey Nomad even
        the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery, Libkey Link and Libkey.io)
        focused mainly on delivery or providing access to things users wanted without
        going out to helping with the discovery aspect.\\n\\nThere was one exception,
        support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available in Lean Library
        (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally did the same
        with[\_LibKey Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March

        using my institution find that this is true. For my institution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on other platforms.\_\\n\\nThis fits,
        given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have
        since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems.
        But presumably Ebsco still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding
        in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin style=\\\"text-align:
        left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about in the past for example
        [here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)
        and [here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but
        here\\\\'s a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows access to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The publisher
        (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to
        the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the whole GetFTR
        to get off the ground at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform
        that supports GetFTR and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_[One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),
        also [Dimensions & Papers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser extension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)
        that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you browse
        across the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available
        June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to add your institution. I
        was half expecting my institution not to appear on the list because we do
        not do federated access generally for access to electronic resources and I
        understand while GetFTR in theory can work with any authentication method,
        they are most closely associated with using Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones that don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        buttons that stated \\\\\\\"full-text available through - Singapore Management

        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the
        &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact,
        any study of trustworthiness in publishing should not be limited to publishers
        already identified as &#8216;predatory&#8217;. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term
        &#8216;predatory publisher&#8217; is an aporia: the moment you define an organisation
        as &#8216;predatory&#8217; is the moment the term collapses and reveals the
        motivation to decide in advance which publishers are good and which are bad
        (often according to geographical boundaries). But this issue cannot be decided
        in advance &#8212; it is undecidable &#8212; and so is continually open to
        interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing is always-already a
        predatory practice or we have to find a different way of analysing trustworthiness.

        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"

        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a

        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
