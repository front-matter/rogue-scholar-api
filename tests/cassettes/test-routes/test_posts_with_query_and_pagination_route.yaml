        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles

        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from

        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span

        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat

        access to subscribed content only works for libraries using\\nEBSCO\\\\'s

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest

        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        Impact. Tis the season.  \\n**In case people didn't know--- the world of scientific
        publishing has\\nseasons: There is the Inundation season, which starts in
        November as\\nauthors rush to submit their papers before the end of year.
        Then there\\nis the Recovery season beginning in January as editors come back
        from\\nholidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in mid-July,
        as\\nall of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation--- and every\\neditor
        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really
        going on behind the curtain and\\nshould the wizard be invested with that
        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on
        a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term\\ncitations it incentivises
        short term citations over everything else,\\nleading to higher ranked journals
        [publishing the most unreliable\\nscience](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/)\\nand
        having the [highest retraction\\nrates](http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full).
        No one knows exactly\\nhow it is\\n[calculated](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/02/10/citable-items-the-contested-impact-factor-denominator/).\\nAnd

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high
        impact\\\" journals. The issue of [\\\"paper mills\\n\\\"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)\\nghost-writing
        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt
        the very least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.\\n\\nLaurie

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        many more eyes see each paper in such journals and the motivation to shoot
        down such high-profile papers might also be higher.\\n\",\"tags\":[\"Science

        extraordinary study has come to light today, showing just how shoddy\\npeer-review
        standards are at some journals.\\n\\nEvidently fascinated by *Science*'s eagerness
        to publish the fatally\\nflawed [Arsenic\\nLife](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/arsenic-life/)\\npaper,
        John Bohannon conceived the idea of constructing a study so\\nincredibly flawed
        that it didn't even include a control. His plan was to\\nsee whether he could
        get it past the notoriously lax *Science*\\npeer-review provided it appealed
        strongly enough to that journal's\\ndesire for \\\"impact\\\" (designed as
        the ability to generate headlines) and\\npandered to its preconceptions (that
        its own publication model is the\\nbest one).\\n\\nSo Bohannon carried out
        the most flawed study he could imagine:\\nsubmitting fake papers to open-access
        journals selected in part from\\nJeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers\_**without
        sending any of\\nhis fake papers to subscription journals,\_**noting that
        many of the\\njournals accepted the papers, and drawing the flagrantly unsupported\\nconclusion
        that open-access publishing is flawed.\\n\\nIncredibly, *Science* not only
        [published this\\nstudy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full),
        but made it\\n[the lead story of today's\\nissue](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154.toc).\\n\\nIt's
        hard to know where *Science* can go from here. Having fallen for\\nBohannon's
        sting, its credibility is shot to pieces. We can only assume\\nthat the AAAS
        will now be added to Beall's list of predatory publishers.\\n\\n# Rolling

        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">won\u2019t see a decline in their career prospects</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in

        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control

        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span

        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest

        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really
        going on behind the curtain and\\nshould the wizard be invested with that
        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on
        a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term\\ncitations it incentivises

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)

        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,

        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation

        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        to publish the fatally\\nflawed [Arsenic\\nLife](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/arsenic-life/)\\npaper,
        John Bohannon conceived the idea of constructing a study so\\nincredibly flawed

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals

        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a

        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat
        your institution has? According [to this\\narticle](https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212),\\n\\\\\\\"the
        access to subscribed content only works for libraries using\\nEBSCO\\\\'s
        Holdings Management tool\\\\\\\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKYUa5duJstn5DRBN-5SaTkx9buVgIAtWTYQrK3ofT-oQoSYWNS7mO-jDtGzPiG5BykdVA7hHLou9W_mhTxJAvlObm7o8Rig4_LUgaNh1rdqaocd4WBabUwzVX3QCxVxOHScwSyihn3AnYNNcRYV2jIRRxSeVYUPwJWD7kizKSfEQIqjh3aCJwmpw3EErV/w640-h286/ebscopassport4.png){border=\\\"0\\\"\\noriginal-height=\\\"234\\\"

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high

        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        its own publication model is the\\nbest one).\\n\\nSo Bohannon carried out
        the most flawed study he could imagine:\\nsubmitting fake papers to open-access
        journals selected in part from\\nJeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers\_**without
        sending any of\\nhis fake papers to subscription journals,\_**noting that
        many of the\\njournals accepted the papers, and drawing the flagrantly unsupported\\nconclusion
        that open-access publishing is flawed.\\n\\nIncredibly, *Science* not only
        [published this\\nstudy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full),
        but made it\\n[the lead story of today's\\nissue](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154.toc).\\n\\nIt's
        hard to know where *Science* can go from here. Having fallen for\\nBohannon's
        sting, its credibility is shot to pieces. We can only assume\\nthat the AAAS
        will now be added to Beall's list of predatory publishers.\\n\\n# Rolling

        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">winner takes all</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span

        that sustained attention to the retraction process has\\nalready led to some
        changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry\\n(JBC), for example. For

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard

        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt
        the very least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.\\n\\nLaurie

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase

        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very

        Impact. Tis the season.  \\n**In case people didn't know--- the world of scientific
        publishing has\\nseasons: There is the Inundation season, which starts in
        November as\\nauthors rush to submit their papers before the end of year.
        Then there\\nis the Recovery season beginning in January as editors come back
        from\\nholidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in mid-July,
        as\\nall of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation--- and every\\neditor
        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really
        going on behind the curtain and\\nshould the wizard be invested with that
        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on
        a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term\\ncitations it incentivises
        short term citations over everything else,\\nleading to higher ranked journals

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high
        impact\\\" journals. The issue of [\\\"paper mills\\n\\\"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)\\nghost-writing
        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher

        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to

        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing

        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        to publish the fatally\\nflawed [Arsenic\\nLife](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/arsenic-life/)\\npaper,
        John Bohannon conceived the idea of constructing a study so\\nincredibly flawed
        that it didn't even include a control. His plan was to\\nsee whether he could
        get it past the notoriously lax *Science*\\npeer-review provided it appealed
        strongly enough to that journal's\\ndesire for \\\"impact\\\" (designed as
        the ability to generate headlines) and\\npandered to its preconceptions (that
        its own publication model is the\\nbest one).\\n\\nSo Bohannon carried out
        the most flawed study he could imagine:\\nsubmitting fake papers to open-access
        journals selected in part from\\nJeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers\_**without
        sending any of\\nhis fake papers to subscription journals,\_**noting that
        many of the\\njournals accepted the papers, and drawing the flagrantly unsupported\\nconclusion
        that open-access publishing is flawed.\\n\\nIncredibly, *Science* not only
        [published this\\nstudy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full),
        but made it\\n[the lead story of today's\\nissue](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154.toc).\\n\\nIt's
        hard to know where *Science* can go from here. Having fallen for\\nBohannon's

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        fee provides important unrestricted reserves that allow\\nfor breathing room
        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span

        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span

        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In

        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest

        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high

        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">winner takes all</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by
        metrics. That\u2019s where initiatives such as DORA &#8212; the </span><a

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t

        buttons that stated \\\\\\\"full-text available\\nthrough - Singapore Management

        users to content behind paywall even for\\nus.\_\\n\\nBut when I clicked on
        the button , I was not asked to authenticate but\\nmost were not behind paywall

        like there is still some life in this area! Particularly curious\\nto see

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest
        retraction rates</a>. No one knows exactly how it is <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/02/10/citable-items-the-contested-impact-factor-denominator/\\\">calculated</a>.
        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really

        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span

        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest

        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        Impact. Tis the season.  \\n**In case people didn't know--- the world of scientific
        publishing has\\nseasons: There is the Inundation season, which starts in
        November as\\nauthors rush to submit their papers before the end of year.
        Then there\\nis the Recovery season beginning in January as editors come back
        from\\nholidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in mid-July,
        as\\nall of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation--- and every\\neditor
        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really
        going on behind the curtain and\\nshould the wizard be invested with that
        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on
        a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term\\ncitations it incentivises
        short term citations over everything else,\\nleading to higher ranked journals
        [publishing the most unreliable\\nscience](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/)\\nand
        having the [highest retraction\\nrates](http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full).
        No one knows exactly\\nhow it is\\n[calculated](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/02/10/citable-items-the-contested-impact-factor-denominator/).\\nAnd

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high
        impact\\\" journals. The issue of [\\\"paper mills\\n\\\"](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)\\nghost-writing
        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt
        the very least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.\\n\\nLaurie

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        many more eyes see each paper in such journals and the motivation to shoot
        down such high-profile papers might also be higher.\\n\",\"tags\":[\"Science

        extraordinary study has come to light today, showing just how shoddy\\npeer-review
        standards are at some journals.\\n\\nEvidently fascinated by *Science*'s eagerness
        to publish the fatally\\nflawed [Arsenic\\nLife](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/arsenic-life/)\\npaper,
        John Bohannon conceived the idea of constructing a study so\\nincredibly flawed
        that it didn't even include a control. His plan was to\\nsee whether he could
        get it past the notoriously lax *Science*\\npeer-review provided it appealed
        strongly enough to that journal's\\ndesire for \\\"impact\\\" (designed as
        the ability to generate headlines) and\\npandered to its preconceptions (that
        its own publication model is the\\nbest one).\\n\\nSo Bohannon carried out
        the most flawed study he could imagine:\\nsubmitting fake papers to open-access
        journals selected in part from\\nJeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers\_**without
        sending any of\\nhis fake papers to subscription journals,\_**noting that
        many of the\\njournals accepted the papers, and drawing the flagrantly unsupported\\nconclusion
        that open-access publishing is flawed.\\n\\nIncredibly, *Science* not only
        [published this\\nstudy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full),
        but made it\\n[the lead story of today's\\nissue](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154.toc).\\n\\nIt's
        hard to know where *Science* can go from here. Having fallen for\\nBohannon's
        sting, its credibility is shot to pieces. We can only assume\\nthat the AAAS
        will now be added to Beall's list of predatory publishers.\\n\\n# Rolling

        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">won\u2019t see a decline in their career prospects</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in

        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control

        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span

        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing
        the most unreliable science</a> and having the <a href=\\\"http://iai.asm.org/content/79/10/3855.full\\\">highest

        And it can shamelessly be <a href=\\\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00005-008-0024-5#/page-1\\\">manipulated</a>

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        scrambles to find just one reviewer.\\n\\nBut the most magical season of all
        happens in June: the season of\\nJournal Impact Factor (jIF). At this mystical
        time of year, every editor\\nand publisher and their marketing team wonders
        *Oh, what will The Web of\\nScience bring us this year?*\\n\\nAll joking aside,
        it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge\\n*impact* on researchers'
        careers and on journal success. Still, we all\\ncan't help but notice that
        this all-powerful number is very much like\\nthe Wizard of Oz... what is really
        going on behind the curtain and\\nshould the wizard be invested with that
        much power?\\n\\nThe clear answer is, well, *no*.\\n\\nJournal IF wasn't developed
        to do what people [now use it\\nfor](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14).\\nIt
        doesn't actually inform which scientists are doing good research and\\ncertainly
        doesn't measure the long-term impact of findings. It is a\\nnumber based on
        a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term\\ncitations it incentivises

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)

        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,

        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation

        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        to publish the fatally\\nflawed [Arsenic\\nLife](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/arsenic-life/)\\npaper,
        John Bohannon conceived the idea of constructing a study so\\nincredibly flawed

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals

        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a

        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat
        your institution has? According [to this\\narticle](https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212),\\n\\\\\\\"the
        access to subscribed content only works for libraries using\\nEBSCO\\\\'s
        Holdings Management tool\\\\\\\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKYUa5duJstn5DRBN-5SaTkx9buVgIAtWTYQrK3ofT-oQoSYWNS7mO-jDtGzPiG5BykdVA7hHLou9W_mhTxJAvlObm7o8Rig4_LUgaNh1rdqaocd4WBabUwzVX3QCxVxOHScwSyihn3AnYNNcRYV2jIRRxSeVYUPwJWD7kizKSfEQIqjh3aCJwmpw3EErV/w640-h286/ebscopassport4.png){border=\\\"0\\\"\\noriginal-height=\\\"234\\\"

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard
        of Oz\u2026 what is really going on behind the curtain and should the wizard
        be invested with that much power?</p>\\n<p>The clear answer is, well, <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Journal
        IF wasn\u2019t developed to do what people <a href=\\\"http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/jifchicago2005.pdf?wa=IPEMBI14\\\">now
        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        it takes a\\nheavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information\\nto
        make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up\\nto
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively\\nlower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I\\nseriously doubt
        the [\\\\~22,000\\npeople](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en)
        dying from,\\nfor example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.\\n\\nA
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for\\nmeasuring
        'true' impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be\\nmanipulated. More,
        most focus on publication rather than including\\nthings like sharing information
        prior to publication, putting things in\\npreprint servers, freely sharing
        data and source code, writing complete\\nmethods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible\\nresearch and more: you know, the things
        that actually promote rapid\\ncommunication, learning best-practices, and
        broadly advancing science.\\n\\nBeing a journal published by a scientific
        institution in China, we see\\nthe glaring negative impact on research and
        scientific communication.\\nHere jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example:
        many universities\\nrequire that in order to graduate, students must publish
        in a journal\\nwith an IF of 2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions
        now\\nrequiring publication in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!\\n\\nWorse
        is that the Chinese government formally acknowledges the\\nimportance of jIF
        with monetary rewards. This mechanism, of course, can\\nonly beget institutionalized
        ways to promote unethical behavior or out\\nright fraud. When academic salaries
        can be proportionally low, this is\\npotentially big money, with institutions
        such as Zhejiang University\\n[being open about author payments](http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203)\\nof
        over \\\\$30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor\\njournals
        (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).\\n\\nSo what is
        the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to\\ninvestigations
        from [Guillaume\\nFilion](https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author),
        about\\n\\\\$10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an impact
        factor 2\\njournal. And Mara Hvistendahl in *Science* uncovered [a \\\"publication\\nbazaar\\\"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035)
        of\\ncompanies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers in supposedly\\n\\\"high

        publications to order, and guaranteeing publication in\\nimpact factor journals
        through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of\\nthe publishing industry.
        Carried out near-industrial scale from a number\\nof companies in China, the
        several hundred papers [highlighted in\\nRetraction Watch for\\npeer-review](http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/)\\nfraud
        is likely just the tip of the iceberg. We [have\\nwritten](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research)\\nOp-eds
        about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading to\\nHong Kong,
        and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong\\noffering similar
        ghost writing and \\\"guaranteed jIF publication\\\" services\\nfor even cheaper
        than those offered in mainland China.\\n\\nWhile researchers in other countries
        can shake their heads in\\nastonishment at these overt activities: is the
        push in these countries\\nto be published in these same journals really, other
        than the formality,\\nany different? And by its very obscurity, is it harder
        to root out. For\\nexample, you can't see or quantitate where, or how often,
        a Dean of a\\ndepartment quietly suggests to their researchers to try to publish
        in\\nhigher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students not to share\\ninformation
        to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.\\nPlus, it is hard
        to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice\\nwhen jIFs are announced
        and published and highlighted everywhere---\\nComing to a billboard near you...\\n\\nOkay---
        yes, jIF is bad when there is too much focus on it for\\nresearcher success,
        and its importance is hard to weed out. (Why it is\\nbad has been written
        about *ad nauseum* too many times to reference:\\njust Google *journal impact
        factor bad*.)*.*\\n\\nSo, why am I writing about this?\\n\\nBecause hooray-
        *GigaScience* obtained its first impact factor last\\nmonth: sigh of relief...
        but mostly a feeling of rage.\\n\\nThe entire process of jumping through hoops
        trying to get tracked leaves\\nfar more than just bad taste in one's mouth.
        Knowing it matters when it\\nshouldn't; being told how many of certain article
        'types' should be\\npublished; limiting reference numbers in certain article
        types because\\nthis might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of citation
        to\\narticle; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing\\nhow
        very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF\\nisn't a
        good metric when a journal doesn't have one--- then trumpeting\\nit to the
        heavens once it does....\\n\\nThe discussion groups about the problems of
        jIF often indicate that the\\neasiest way to reduce *the jIF effect* is by
        having funding agencies and\\nresearch institutions stop including jIF in
        making financial decisions\\n(and many have). However, this isn't so simple:
        funding agencies,\\nresearch institutions, and universities can use how often
        their\\nresearchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their fund raising\\nand
        in increasing student applications... So... who really can we target\\nas
        the main player to stop the cycle?\\n\\nObviously this needs to be multi-pronged,
        and this idea isn't new, but\\nit isn't easy to implement. But one place that
        can, in one\\nglobally-agreed-on sweeping move, both reduce the ease of finding
        jIFs\\nand make it less \\\"in your face\\\", is by all publishers agreeing
        to remove\\nthis number from their websites, from their marketing flyers,
        from their\\nemails.\\n\\nSeveral publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and
        PLOS journals) do this,\\nbut, in just the three weeks since the latest jIFs
        came out, I have\\nreceived a bonanza of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs;
        increased\\njIFs, established jIFs; and \\\"here are all of our journals'
        jIFs\\\". I\\nalmost feel that some deranged used-car salesman has taken up
        permanent\\nresidence in my inbox. But a real indication of how embedded the
        use of\\njIF has become in the publishing industry is that even though our\\npublisher
        has firmly supported us when we requested that our jIF not be\\nposted on
        our or their website, in marketing flyers, or in emails, it\\nnever-the-less
        appeared up front, top, and bolded in our most recent\\narticle alert e-mail.
        This was not because our publisher decided to\\nignore how seriously we felt
        about this; it was simply that the\\npublisher's auto-alert emails for journals
        have a standard template that\\nincludes jIFs for any journal that has one.
        No one sees these emails\\nbefore they go out, and thus it was missed. That
        is how hard-wired jIF\\nuse has become in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.\\n\\nYes---
        I understand, the researchers want to know it, but we're not\\nusing it to
        give researchers what they want: we're using it to sell\\njournals. Which
        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In

        its own publication model is the\\nbest one).\\n\\nSo Bohannon carried out
        the most flawed study he could imagine:\\nsubmitting fake papers to open-access
        journals selected in part from\\nJeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers\_**without
        sending any of\\nhis fake papers to subscription journals,\_**noting that
        many of the\\njournals accepted the papers, and drawing the flagrantly unsupported\\nconclusion
        that open-access publishing is flawed.\\n\\nIncredibly, *Science* not only
        [published this\\nstudy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full),
        but made it\\n[the lead story of today's\\nissue](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154.toc).\\n\\nIt's
        hard to know where *Science* can go from here. Having fallen for\\nBohannon's
        sting, its credibility is shot to pieces. We can only assume\\nthat the AAAS
        will now be added to Beall's list of predatory publishers.\\n\\n# Rolling

        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While there are some scientists who are concerned
        that publicizing retractions &#8212; \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D
        so to speak &#8212; could give ammunition to those who want to defund research,
        most are very supportive. They realize that the best way to build trust is
        to acknowledge that errors and misconduct exist, and to show the world how
        science corrects itself. In other words, the growth in retractions </span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is a good thing</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s
        even evidence that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. But that depends on retraction notices that
        provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when those notices make it clear
        there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved. We\u2019ve of course argued
        for detailed notices since we launched Retraction Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How
        have digital platforms and tools changed the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered?
        How have they enabled Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">The simple fact that the vast majority of scholarly papers are online
        today means that more people can read &#8212; and scrutinize &#8212; them.
        Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or layperson can reverse engineer
        the manipulation that created a problematic image. As I write this, a team
        has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">announced</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different
        results, but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course
        a good tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication &#8212; aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        &#8212; of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What
        has really moved the field forward, however, are platforms such as PubPeer,
        an \u201Conline journal club\u201D where scientists share critiques of papers.
        A number of corrections and retractions have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">flowed from those discussions</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. (PubMed Commons was another such tool, although
        discussions were not as critical, and the National Library of Medicine </span><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">recently decided to shut it down</span></a><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I would argue that sustained attention to the retraction process
        has already led to some changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry
        (JBC), for example. For the first five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s
        retraction notices were bereft of content, noting simply that the article
        in question had been retracted at the request of the authors or the editors.
        In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">that changed</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive journals when it
        comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">In a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct
        is impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As others have noted, the \u201C</span><a
        href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">winner takes all</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">\u201D approach to credit in science &#8212; and therefore to doling
        out grants and jobs &#8212; has created enormous pressure and forces researchers
        to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D journals. That means
        everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering results, and
        that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit error.</span></p>\\n<p><span

        that sustained attention to the retraction process has\\nalready led to some
        changes. Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry\\n(JBC), for example. For

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t

        Impact. Tis the season.<br />\\n</strong>In case people didn\u2019t know\u2014
        the world of scientific publishing has seasons: There is the Inundation season,
        which starts in November as authors rush to submit their papers before the
        end of year. Then there is the Recovery season beginning in January as editors
        come back from holidays to tackle the glut. The season of Absence hits in
        mid-July, as all of Europe prepares to go on a month-long vacation\u2014 and
        every editor scrambles to find just one reviewer.</p>\\n<p>But the most magical
        season of all happens in June: the season of Journal Impact Factor (jIF).
        At this mystical time of year, every editor and publisher and their marketing
        team wonders <em>Oh, what will The Web of Science bring us this year?</em></p>\\n<p>All
        joking aside, it is hard to ignore jIF because they have a huge <em>impact</em>
        on researchers\u2019 careers and on journal success. Still, we all can\u2019t
        help but notice that this all-powerful number is very much like the Wizard

        use it for</a>. It doesn\u2019t actually inform which scientists are doing
        good research and certainly doesn\u2019t measure the long-term impact of findings.
        It is a number based on a single parameter. By focussing purely on short term
        citations it incentivises short term citations over everything else, leading
        to higher ranked journals <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">publishing

        it takes a heavy toll on the length of time researchers take to share information
        to make sure they can publish in the highest IF journals. It can add up to
        years if they submit to one after another journal with a successively lower
        jIF to get into the highest jIF journal possible. Though, I seriously doubt
        the <a href=\\\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en\\\">~22,000
        people</a> dying from, for example, cancer every DAY, care where it is published.</p>\\n<p>A
        fair amount of work has gone into creating new/modified metrics for measuring
        \u2018true\u2019 impact, but each have drawbacks and can also be manipulated.
        More, most focus on publication rather than including things like sharing
        information prior to publication, putting things in preprint servers, freely
        sharing data and source code, writing complete methods, collaborating, educating
        young researchers, reproducible research and more: you know, the things that
        actually promote rapid communication, learning best-practices, and broadly
        advancing science.</p>\\n<p>Being a journal published by a scientific institution
        in China, we see the glaring negative impact on research and scientific communication.
        Here jIF has been taken to an extreme. For example: many universities require
        that in order to graduate, students must publish in a journal with an IF of
        2 or more. One-upsmanship has led to institutions now requiring publication
        in a journal with an IF of 6 or higher!</p>\\n<p>Worse is that the Chinese
        government formally acknowledges the importance of jIF with monetary rewards.
        This mechanism, of course, can only beget institutionalized ways to promote
        unethical behavior or out right fraud. When academic salaries can be proportionally
        low, this is potentially big money, with institutions such as Zhejiang University
        <a href=\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20110203\\\">being open about author
        payments</a> of over $30,000 for articles published in the top impact factor
        journals (anecdotal stories indicate the amount can be even higher).</p>\\n<p>So
        what is the ultimate cost of the impact factor? Well according to investigations
        from <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/102441667247494916086?rel=author\\\">Guillaume
        Filion</a>, about $10,000. At least for a ready-written publication in an
        impact factor 2 journal. And Mara Hvistendahl in <em>Science</em> uncovered
        <a href=\\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6162/1035\\\">a \u201Cpublication
        bazaar\u201D</a> of companies adding last minute authorship to in-press papers
        in supposedly \u201Chigh impact\u201D journals. The issue of <a href=\\\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/\\\">\u201Cpaper
        mills \u201D</a> ghost-writing publications to order, and guaranteeing publication
        in impact factor journals through peer-review fraud, is a dirty secret of
        the publishing industry. Carried out near-industrial scale from a number of
        companies in China, the several hundred papers <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/faked-emails/\\\">highlighted
        in Retraction Watch for peer-review</a> fraud is likely just the tip of the
        iceberg. We <a href=\\\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1758662/china-must-restructure-its-academic-incentives-curb-research\\\">have
        written</a> Op-eds about the same skewed incentive systems potentially spreading
        to Hong Kong, and have subsequently uncovered companies in Hong Kong offering
        similar ghost writing and \u201Cguaranteed jIF publication\u201D services
        for even cheaper than those offered in mainland China.</p>\\n<p>While researchers
        in other countries can shake their heads in astonishment at these overt activities:
        is the push in these countries to be published in these same journals really,
        other than the formality, any different? And by its very obscurity, is it
        harder to root out. For example, you can\u2019t see or quantitate where, or
        how often, a Dean of a department quietly suggests to their researchers to
        try to publish in higher jIF journals, or places where advisors tell students
        not to share information to make sure they can get published in high jIF places.
        Plus, it is hard to truly ignore jIF and reduce any inherent prejudice when
        jIFs are announced and published and highlighted everywhere\u2014 Coming to
        a billboard near you\u2026</p>\\n<p>Okay\u2014 yes, jIF is bad when there
        is too much focus on it for researcher success, and its importance is hard
        to weed out. (Why it is bad has been written about <em>ad nauseum</em> too
        many times to reference: just Google <em>journal impact factor bad</em>.)<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>So,
        why am I writing about this?</p>\\n<p>Because hooray- <em>GigaScience</em>
        obtained its first impact factor last month: sigh of relief\u2026 but mostly
        a feeling of rage.</p>\\n<p>The entire process of jumping through hoops trying
        to get tracked leaves far more than just bad taste in one\u2019s mouth. Knowing
        it matters when it shouldn\u2019t; being told how many of certain article
        \u2018types\u2019 should be published; limiting reference numbers in certain
        article types because this might affect the denominator in the jIF ratio of
        citation to article; trying to estimate the jIF before it comes out and realizing
        how very non-transparent that calculation is; and telling people jIF isn\u2019t
        a good metric when a journal doesn\u2019t have one\u2014 then trumpeting it
        to the heavens once it does\u2026.</p>\\n<p>The discussion groups about the
        problems of jIF often indicate that the easiest way to reduce <em>the jIF
        effect</em> is by having funding agencies and research institutions stop including
        jIF in making financial decisions (and many have). However, this isn\u2019t
        so simple: funding agencies, research institutions, and universities can use
        how often their researchers publish in high jIF journals as part of their
        fund raising and in increasing student applications\u2026 So\u2026 who really
        can we target as the main player to stop the cycle?</p>\\n<p>Obviously this
        needs to be multi-pronged, and this idea isn\u2019t new, but it isn\u2019t
        easy to implement. But one place that can, in one globally-agreed-on sweeping
        move, both reduce the ease of finding jIFs and make it less \u201Cin your
        face\u201D, is by all publishers agreeing to remove this number from their
        websites, from their marketing flyers, from their emails.</p>\\n<p>Several
        publishers and journals (e.g., eLife and PLOS journals) do this, but, in just
        the three weeks since the latest jIFs came out, I have received a bonanza
        of myriad emails announcing: first jIFs; increased jIFs, established jIFs;
        and \u201Chere are all of our journals\u2019 jIFs\u201D. I almost feel that
        some deranged used-car salesman has taken up permanent residence in my inbox.
        But a real indication of how embedded the use of jIF has become in the publishing
        industry is that even though our publisher has firmly supported us when we
        requested that our jIF not be posted on our or their website, in marketing
        flyers, or in emails, it never-the-less appeared up front, top, and bolded
        in our most recent article alert e-mail. This was not because our publisher
        decided to ignore how seriously we felt about this; it was simply that the
        publisher\u2019s auto-alert emails for journals have a standard template that
        includes jIFs for any journal that has one. No one sees these emails before
        they go out, and thus it was missed. That is how hard-wired jIF use has become
        in journal marketing: it is an auto-include.</p>\\n<p>Yes\u2014 I understand,
        the researchers want to know it, but we\u2019re not using it to give researchers
        what they want: we\u2019re using it to sell journals. Which is a shame, when
        we, like everyone else, know it does more harm than good.</p>\\n<p>Reducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as journals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails are updated, of course).</p>\\n<p>So,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our wanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing\u2014 I implore you to remove
        jIF from every one of your journals\u2019 websites, flyers, and emails.</p>\\n<p>At
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment) (<a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/dora\\\">http://www.ascb.org/dora</a>)
        and follow their recommendations for <a href=\\\"http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf\\\">reducing
        the use of jIF</a>, Though, better would be to take a stand with the other
        publishers who have already done so and simply eliminate it completely.</p>\\n<p>I
        also appeal to other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push this
        yourselves by telling your publisher you do not want it used for your journal.
        (And if you are thinking\u2014 but we need it for people to submit articles
        to us\u2026 then you are using it for marketing.)</p>\\n<p>Will this solve
        the jIF problem? No. But it is a straightforward, easy step to take (when
        willing). It will ultimately mean that those who really care about jIF will
        have to take that extra step to look it up (or pay Thomson Reuters). Making
        jIF less readily available will make it harder for it to be so easily used
        in inappropriate ways. Tell researchers what your journal does to improve
        scientific communication instead of using a one dimensional, non-transparent,
        readily gameable, two-years past indication as a stand-in that, <a href=\\\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/\\\">more
        often than not, promotes bad scientific practices</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the very
        least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.</p>\\n<p>Laurie

        is a shame, when we, like everyone else, know it does\\nmore harm than good.\\n\\nReducing
        the apparent importance of this number is something we as\\njournals and publishers
        can actually do quite easily (once auto emails\\nare updated, of course).\\n\\nSo,
        Springer-Nature BMC, while I thank you for being on board with our\\nwanting
        to eliminate the use of jIF for our marketing--- I implore you\\nto remove
        jIF from every one of your journals' websites, flyers, and\\nemails.\\n\\nAt
        the very least, sign DORA (Declaration of Research Assessment)\\n(<http://www.ascb.org/dora>)
        and follow their recommendations for\\n[reducing the use of\\njIF](http://www.ascb.org/files/SFDeclarationFINAL.pdf),
        Though, better\\nwould be to take a stand with the other publishers who have
        already done\\nso and simply eliminate it completely.\\n\\nI also appeal to
        other publishers to do the same. Editors, you can push\\nthis yourselves by
        telling your publisher you do not want it used for\\nyour journal. (And if
        you are thinking--- but we need it for people to\\nsubmit articles to us...
        then you are using it for marketing.)\\n\\nWill this solve the jIF problem?
        No. But it is a straightforward, easy\\nstep to take (when willing). It will
        ultimately mean that those who\\nreally care about jIF will have to take that
        extra step to look it up\\n(or pay Thomson Reuters). Making jIF less readily
        available will make it\\nharder for it to be so easily used in inappropriate
        ways. Tell\\nresearchers what your journal does to improve scientific communication\\ninstead
        of using a one dimensional, non-transparent, readily gameable,\\ntwo-years
        past indication as a stand-in that, [more often than not,\\npromotes bad scientific\\npractices](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/).\\n\\nAt
        the very least, it will reduce the sense that we are selling science.\\n\\nLaurie

        the\\n[last](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jun/12/scientific-retractions-fraud-explored)\\n\\\"Science
        Weekly\\\" podcast from the Guardian, the topic was retractions.\_\\nAt about
        20:29 into the episode, [Hannah\\nDevlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin)
        asked,\\nwhether the reason 'top' journals retract more articles may be because\\nof
        increased scrutiny there.\\n\\nThe underlying assumption is very reasonable,
        as many more eyes see each\\npaper in such journals and the motivation to
        shoot down such\\nhigh-profile papers might also be higher. However, the question
        has\\nactually been addressed in the scientific literature and the data don't\\nseem
        to support this assumption. For one, [this\\nfigure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3479492/figure/fig03/?report=objectonly){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\nshows
        that there are a lot of retractions from lower ranking journals,\\nbut the
        journals who retract a lot are few and far between. In fact,\\nthere are many
        more retractions in low-ranking journals than in\\nhigh-ranking ones. Of the
        high-ranking journals, a much larger\\nproportion also retracts many papers.
        However, this analysis only shows\\nthat there are many more retractions in
        lower journals than in higher\\njournals on an absolute level. Hence, these
        data are not conclusive, but\\nsuggestive that scrutiny is not really all
        that much higher for the\\n'top' journals than anywhere else.\\n\\nAnother
        reason why scrutiny might be assumed to be higher in 'top'\\njournals is that
        readership is higher, leading to more potential for\\nerror detection. However,
        the same reasoning can be applied to\\ncitations, and not only retractions.
        Moreover, citing a 'top' paper is\\nnot only easier than forcing a retraction,
        it also benefits your own\\nresearch by elevating the perceived importance
        of your field. Thus, if\\nreadership had any such influence, one would expect
        journal rank to\\ncorrelate better with citations than with retractions. The
        opposite is\\nthe case: The coefficient of determination for citations with
        journal\\nrank currently lies around 0.2, while that coefficient comes to
        lie at\\njust under 0.8 for retractions and journal rank (Fig. 3 and Fig.
        1D,\\nrespectively,\\n[here](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)).\\nSo
        while there may be a small effect of scrutiny/motivation, the\\nevidence seems
        to suggest that it is a relatively minor effect, if there\\nis one at all.\\n\\nConversely,
        there is quite solid evidence that the methodology in 'top'\\njournals is
        not any better than in other journals, when analyzing\\nnon-retracted articles.
        In fact, there are studies showing that the\\nmethodology is actually *worse*
        in 'top' journals, while we have not\\nfound a single study suggesting the
        methodology gets better with journal\\nrank. Our\\n[article](https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)\\nreviews
        these studies. Importantly, these studies all concern\\nnon-retracted papers,
        i.e., the other 99.95% of the literature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the evidence
        suggests scrutiny is likely a negligible\\nfactor in the correlation of journal
        rank and retractions, while\\nincreased incidence of fraud and lower methodological
        standards can be\\nshown.\\n\\nI know [Ivan\\nOransky](https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/),\\nwho
        was a guest on the show, is aware of these data, so it may have been\\na bit
        unfortunate that Phillip Campbell (editor-in-chief at Nature\\nMagazine) got
        to answer this question before Ivan had a chance to lay\\nthese data out.
        In fact, Nature is also aware of these data and has\\ntwice refused publishing
        them. The first time when we submitted our\\nmanuscript, with the statement,
        that Nature had already published\\narticles that stated that [Nature publishes
        the worst\\nscience](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2013/06/everybody-already-knows-journal-rank-is-bunk).\\nThe
        second time was when Cori Lok interviewed Jon Tennant and he told\\nher about
        the data, but Cori [failed to include this\\npart](https://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/09/how-nature-magazine-consistently-prefers-anecdote-over-data)\\nof
        the interview. There is thus a record of Nature, very understandably,\\navoiding
        to admit their failure to select for solid science. Phillip\\nCampbell's answer
        to the question in the podcast may have been at least\\nthe third time.\\n\\nWhile
        Phillip Campbell did admit they don't do enough fraud-detection\\n(it is too
        rare), the issue of reliability in science goes far beyond\\nfraud, so successfully
        derailing the question towards this direction\\nserved his company quite well.
        Clearly, he's a clever guy and did not\\ncome unprepared.\\n\\nFinally, one
        may ask: why do the 'top' journals publish unreliable\\nscience?\\n\\nProbably
        the most important factor is that they attract \\\"too good to be\\ntrue\\\"
        results, but only apply \\\"peer-review light\\\": rejection rates drop\\ndramatically
        from 92% to a mere 60% once your manuscript makes it past\\nthe editors, that's
        a 5-fold increase in your publication chances (Noah\\nGray and Henry Gee,
        pers. comm.). Why is that so? First, the reviewers\\nknow the editor wants
        to publish this paper. Second, they have an\\nautomatic conflict of interest,
        as a Nature paper in their field\\nincreases the visibility of their field,
        they may even be cited in the\\npaper -- or plan to cite it in their upcoming
        grant application.\\n\\nOn average, this entire model is just a recipe for
        disaster and more\\npolicing won't fix it. By using it, we have been setting
        us up for the\\nexponential rise in retractions to be seen in [Fig. 1a of
        our\\npaper](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg).\\n\\nSo,
        in the probably not too unlikely case that the topic of unreliable\\nscience
        should come up again, anyone can now cite the actual,\\npeer-reviewed data
        we have at hand, such that editors-in-chief may have\\na harder time derailing
        the discussion and obfuscating the issues in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**tl;dr:**
        The data suggest a combination of three factors leading to\\nmore retractions
        in 'top' journals: 1. Worse methodological quality; 2.\\nHigher incidence
        of fraud 3. Peer-review light. One would intuitively\\nexpect increased readership/scrutiny
        to play some role, but there is\\ncurrently no evidence for it and some circumstantial
        evidence against\\nit.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/jgggm-t5x67\",\"guid\":\"http://bjoern.brembs.net/?p=925\",\"id\":\"722eccad-af31-4650-93ef-105c5df6da92\",\"image\":\"https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/45406/fnhum-07-00291-r2/image_m/fnhum-07-00291-g001.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1434631090,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"In
