        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Hi, and welcome to the Open Update. I'm
        Chris Hartgerink for Liberate Science, joined by Sarahanne Field, here in
        Berlin still,</p><p>[00:00:05] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> Hello.</p><p>[00:00:07]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> though we're recording all of this in one
        day and sharing those episodes so she's not been in Berlin all these.</p><p>[00:00:13]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I've been in Berlin for two months. Yes.</p><p>[00:00:16]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> So we've been doing this entire series
        of episodes on the history of open science over the past decade, how we've
        experienced it, and also looking forward into the magic crystal ball about
        what we want to happen in the next 10 years.</p><p>And one of the things we
        ended the last episode on was also this question of does the burden of open
        science or open research or just in general, improving research practices
        fall mostly on early career researchers or junior researchers.</p><p>There's
        an argument to be made that most of the research that gets published gets
        done by junior researchers. 20% or something of junior researchers end up
        getting tenure. So there's also a four to one for junior researchers to tenured
        researchers. The masses , the labor force is also primarily junior researchers.</p><p>So
        from that we might logically conclude that yes, most of the burden of improving
        research practice falls on junior researchers because they are the practicing
        researchers. But with that, I think Sarahanne, you had some ideas around this.
        I've already very quickly scratched the surface that I think yes, that is
        the case.</p><p>Now that you're sort of, you're transitioning from junior
        to mid-career researcher, do you feel like you're being unburdened then in
        terms of improving research practices?</p><p>[00:01:42] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> The thing is that I never felt pressure in the first place.
        I found meta research, fell in love with it, and have committed myself to
        acting, thinking, speaking, practicing in a certain way. Coming back to, to
        the theme of this series, this idea of, looking back and, and looking forward,
        I think we're in a different generation now. I think the generation maybe
        you and I began our research trajectories within, I think it was a different
        story to what it is now.</p><p>I think we're seeing a lot of the ECR starting
        to mature into roles where they are teaching, supervising in large groups
        of students, whereas 10 years ago, a lot of us were, were just starting. Obviously,
        the meta researchers that we engage with, they're coming from all different,
        you know, career stages.</p><p>But I get the sense, from my own experience,
        my knowledge that a lot of people have who are now teaching and now supervising,
        have grown up in a world a, a research sphere where meta research openness
        is a little more commonplace.</p><p>So I think we have a different burden
        now. It is not so much the burden of learning those practices ourselves, but
        it's the burden of passing those on. I find it very exciting. I find that
        responsibility very important. It's one that I take really seriously. I do
        think that that previously a lot of the burden fell on the ECRs, and I wonder
        if looking forward if that's still gonna be the case.</p><p>[00:03:17] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> If I understand correctly, because the practices have
        become more established, that it's no longer as much a burden for the people
        who grew, quote unquote, \\\"grew up\\\" academically with this, and now the
        burden is more sharing that knowledge and upskilling.</p><p>From my experience,
        it's junior researchers who are at the end of the open science policies that
        get implemented. They're the ones responsible for ultimately publishing the
        open data, making sure everything is correct, everything is up to date, figuring
        out how, if there is a mistake, how to update it, creating, understanding
        how, get repositories work and how you could sync them with Zenodo. Something,
        the PIs might not even know anything about, so that the junior researchers
        really are the ones handholding the senior researchers.</p><p>This problem
        of the lack of training trajectories in implementing these open science policies
        because it ends up on the professor's plate and they just, Throw it onto the
        junior researchers, figure it out.</p><p>We had this, when I was still at
        Tilburg University, there was a data audit procedure and it was like, there
        is now a data audit procedure. They phased it in. But I mean, if you're not
        subjected to part of the pilot period, you wouldn't get any additional training.
        And then subsequently at the very end, you know, I had to supply data packages
        for audits for each of my dissertation chapters. And nobody even actually
        mentioned this before I was done. So if I had not done this practice myself
        already, I would have to catch up, at that moment. So there's this point of
        all these policies getting implemented, but the training not being there,
        and I think there's also literally this question of what are the training
        needs as a result of these policies?</p><p>[00:05:17] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong>
        This comes back to something you said last episode. The communication, the
        clarity of communication, being really essential. When you start a PhD, at
        least in my experience, you. There's, there's so much onus on the beginning,
        getting your idea for the papers set up, if you're doing it by, by publication,
        getting the proposal approved, getting the idea, you're excited about this
        idea.</p><p>The, the absolute last thing as a PhD, new PhD candidate that
        you are thinking about is what your data package at the end of the end of
        the whole process is gonna look like and how you're gonna do it. This comes
        also back to onboarding, you know, when it comes to, to keeping your practices
        responsible and open.</p><p>Just being really clear with, with new researchers
        as they come into the business, to sort of make it super clear what's expected
        of them and keep that in the back of their minds. Coach 'em as they go through.
        Remember, we've just finished a paper. Keep in mind that you are gonna need
        a folder. For this data, these materials, the README or the code book or whatever,
        that's gonna need to be in your data package when you submit, before you can
        defend.</p><p>But one tension I think is the fact that the PI tends to be
        the one that signs off for responsibility of a lot of research in labs that
        gets conducted, but they're often not the ones who are making the protocols,
        putting them online, collecting the data, making the metadata. That's something
        that I think is sort of a little bit in tension at least sometimes.</p><p>[00:06:57]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Interesting that you see that as tension,
        because I would like when you say this, I'm, I'm detaching this from the academic
        environment for a second. The supervisor on a factory floor is responsible
        for everybody on the factory floor. Yet there, this is not an, not quote unquote
        \\\"an issue\\\" because it's very clear that there's a certain responsibility
        and that processes need to be in place to ensure that.</p><p>That you can't
        just say, well, I didn't know because you, you're responsible for it. So you
        have to know. So in that scenario, you have to put in place processes to make
        sure that you know, and if you don't, then that's, that's the failing of the
        supervisor on the factory floor. And I think it's the same in an academic
        setting. 'cause there's so much just. Do X, do Y, but there's no reporting
        back or ensuring documentation, insufficient places that decisions get documented,
        that there's consistent evaluation procedures. So in that sense it definitely
        will amplify any of those frictions that exist, well exist because the, the
        procedures are lacking. I would argue that's not too hard, but the culture
        is very much laissez-faire. Like you figure it out, we'll do whatever. And
        I think this is also part of the problem that we got to earlier with the,
        with the policies and the implementation is, you know, all of this, it's not
        a static thing. You can read a policy document once, think you understand
        it, just like a law, but the law and the, then the policy keeps changing and
        I think there's a certain responsibility.</p><p>To, for organizations to indicate
        what is changing, how it is changing, and then also certain, responsibility
        to then, you know, pass that information on. Maybe the defense regulations
        change a month before you submit your dissertation, you're still subject to
        those new regulations or new policy. There needs to be a mechanism to get
        informed about that, whether that is the supervisor, like instructing all
        the supervisors, Hey, don't forget, instruct your PhDs that this, this, and
        this was changing otherwise your timeline might be at risk or that there is
        a clear mechanism for that information just to be shared, university-wide.</p><p>And
        so in that sense, all to say is, are there sufficient procedures and quality
        assurance processes pretty much in place to make sure that when stuff changes,
        the burden is accounted for somewhere. Because if you don't plan for it, what,
        what is the famous saying? If you don't plan for success, you plan for failure
        or something,</p><p>[00:09:51] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> You accept
        failure or something like that? Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>But I think what you're
        saying, a lot of that can just be boiled down if you want to, to communication,
        right? Regular communication. Clear communication. Fair communication that
        goes both ways.</p><p>That comes back to sort of my, my thoughts or my concerns
        about. ECRs being lumped with a lot of the work of responsible conduct of
        open research.</p><p>I don't, I mean, obviously the issues with equity exist.
        Giving an ECR a lot of this extra methodological work, for example, or this
        extra labor is, is problematic in itself. But I think is also the problem
        of the fact that it's not communicated clearly at the start that that's even
        necessarily their role.</p><p>There's no expectation management really there.
        So when things have to be done because of a university policy, for example,
        or some requirement, it's like, oh, here's that work. It's foisting it off
        onto them, or, or passing the buck to them rather than that being, you know,
        an, an agreement at the start of.</p><p>Supervision or at the start of some
        kind of working relationship discussion about whose role is then I would argue
        as someone who's a strong proponent for widespread responsible conduct of
        research that it's each researcher's individual responsibility and in that
        sense that the responsibility is uniformly distributed across a research team.</p><p>But
        there's an extent to which that that can't always be the case. So for example,
        in big team science, Not every single person can be reasonably expected to
        have gone through all of the aspects, for example, of an analysis, especially
        if it's not their specialization, if they can't understand that analysis well.
        There are exceptions to that of course, but I'm saying as a general rule in
        a supervisor student relationship, for example, that responsibility being
        equally divided, you know, the person who has to sign off on the research
        has a responsibility to know what the subordinate or the student is doing.</p><p>And
        the student who is doing a lot of the research needs to, there needs to be
        clearer communication. They are also responsible, but they're, you know, in
        that relationship, they have a shared responsibility.</p><p>[00:12:06] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> I hear you on the individual responsibility and of course
        like Almost a communal responsibility towards each other. There's of course
        always the flip side of sort of what is the system they're in precarious positions,
        overload of students, overflowing with teaching responsibilities. So there's
        also that aspect of, are sufficient resources available to do all of the work,
        or is the amount of resources or the amount of work that's required, is that
        already more than the work week to begin with?</p><p>So there's also a certain
        aspect there where literally respecting the work hours and being realistic
        in the estimates and the planning would be worthwhile. I personally feel if
        you allot four hours of supervision time, every week , it should be clear
        that they should only be allowed to supervise a certain amount of students
        on their own. If they're supervising with two people needs to be clear what
        the division is, whether it's 50 50 or not, and then really manage and plan
        that time to say, okay, you now have five PhD students at a hundred percent
        capacity. That means that half a week is already gone for the entire year,
        like you need to plan for that. So then if you have 20 hours a week of teaching,
        that's it. Nothing extra anymore, but taking that kind of resource management
        seriously isn't done because the gaps would be astronomical because I mean,
        how many PIs do you know who supervise more, more than five people?</p><p>[00:13:44]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> You, you hear this? I mean, PhD students.
        To saying, oh, I, I don't get even ever able to talk to my supervisor because
        they just don't have time. They have too many students. You hear this? That's
        all the time.</p><p>[00:13:55] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> That's already
        a problem big enough, because that literally means figure it out. Whether
        that's open research practices or just in general how to do anything. And
        I know situations where people were literally delayed with getting their PhD
        for. I don't know, six months a year, because they just hadn't read the latest
        version that only needed to be edited for, you know, minor sentence or minor
        corrections.</p><p>[00:14:20] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I, I think
        that's, that's certainly a thing that going forward has to be addressed better.
        This comes back to the, the kind of research culture that the research reform
        movement is trying to develop is, is things like this that make the workplace
        an acceptable place for junior researchers to flourish and to develop. You
        know, I mean, we get super high attrition and part of that is things like
        this.</p><p>[00:14:46] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> This also immediately
        goes to the core of the issue, right? Because if we, again, dissociate from
        the research space for a moment, it's about there's a certain amount of labor
        energy. And if we manage that effectively, the gap would become very clear
        and the exploitation would become very clear how you're not getting compensated
        for the amount of effort you're putting in.</p><p>So if you do overtime at
        an organization that is gonna benefit somebody else, if you're not getting
        paid for it. Within research, we very often say, but it's my passion. We're
        internally motivated. And that's how you balance it out, and then you might
        get some reputation for it Instead, if you, you know, you become a professor
        Wow. And you get a PhD. Wow.</p><p>It's not an accident that this management
        of the time and the, the planning for it is not built in. And so there is
        this question of are we gonna recognize that this is not a problem that came
        unintentionally, but it's by, not any individual's design, but it is an intended
        effect and that is not gonna go away by accident either.</p><p>[00:16:00]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> So what you've just said is extremely dark
        to me, partly because it's so recognizable and it's so endemic. The whole
        idea that this is an intentional thing. That, that it's not an accident. You
        know, the idea that a, a university relies on the fact that people don't tend
        to do the math and stick to it. That is especially dark for me because I personally
        feel like I have the confidence to be able to deal with this in my workplace.</p><p>I
        feel like I'm confident enough and self-assured enough that I can make my
        own boundaries in my workplace. But, coming back to sort of the overarching
        theme of this podcast season, when you have someone who's acting in a work
        relationship where they are subordinate based on their, their say, their career
        stage. For them being able to manage the expectations of their supervisor.
        It's not a trivial thing for them to say \\\"I'm, I don't want to email you
        on the weekend.\\\" If for, for so many, for example, first or second year,
        PhD researchers, that would be an incredibly difficult line to draw in the
        sand and say, these are my boundaries. I'm gonna defend them.</p><p>Even just
        making those boundaries in the first place clear would be very scary. Let
        alone defending them, especially if you have a supervisor who wants to be
        violating them. So I think that is something as ECRs it's, it's really difficult
        to navigate these toxic problems in, in the academic sphere because it is
        so just, it permeates everything.</p><p>Our, our whole sort of culture, how
        we mentally deal with the workload, what our expectations are. But again,
        just coming back to this sort of sub theme is a micro theme of, of this clarity
        of communication, expectation management.</p><p>[00:17:53] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong>
        It's not all doom and gloom because there's also plenty of work in that space
        where it's like responsible conduct of research, role modeling. It's Dr. Tamarinde
        Haven, for example, about this work on, well, role modeling really matters.
        If the PIs have pre-registered work or pre-printed the PhD candidate is more
        likely to do that behavior as well. Whether that's because of teaching or
        bio osmosis or whatever, that's irrelevant, but it is a relation there. That
        could be very similar with respecting just private time, planning your work
        properly.</p><p>It makes a lot of sense. PIs end up very often not always
        being bosses and mentors as well. You learn certain behaviors from them. How
        do you do certain things? Because supposedly they're present. Not all of them
        are, but they have the skills that you're trying to learn, so it makes sense
        that you learn them from them in a certain way. And so, especially PhD Candidates,
        very often for people it's their first step into a certain work environment
        that goes beyond just literally being a student.</p><p>Sometimes it feels
        like people who are in those positions, they don't recognize that they're
        role modeling regardless. So also indeed having that space for them to understand
        what kind of role model do I want to be is incredibly important. But yeah,
        if you're running 10 PhD students a month like you don't really have much
        time except if you really plan for just doing that.</p><p>[00:19:26] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> That is why I am excited and optimistic, maybe more than is
        warranted about, say, the next 10 years, and why I don't think necessarily
        that stagnation is a, a big risk in a lot of ways is that I see so many of
        my cohort, for example, people that I did my PhD at the same time as who are
        now walking into faculty positions who are starting to supervise students.</p><p>Their
        approach to these things, their philosophy about conducting research, about
        the research culture that they wanna see different. There are so many mindsets
        here that are really positive that will be passed, even just osmotically down
        to the next generation of researchers. I'm really excited about that and I
        know that there are loads of great supervisors in our supervisors generation,
        for example, who are now full profs or even emeritus. They also had great
        mindsets, but I think, I do believe that there is a culture shift here that
        is slowly starting to creep into some, some ways of working, maybe not always
        successfully and meaningfully and, you know, with longevity.</p><p>But I do
        see positive change and I guess I have to be optimistic about that if I wanna
        stay in academia.</p><p>[00:20:38] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Well,
        I'm glad that we balance each other out in that sense because I think that
        for, for me personally, of course, I'm outside of this environment, so take
        everything I say with a grain of salt. But On an individual level, I can agree.
        On a systems level, I sometimes feel like the the friction is getting more
        and more amplified.</p><p>So that it doesn't matter as much what the individual
        can or wants to do. Not to say they can't make a change. I think in that sense,
        you know operating based on your principles can really have a ripple effect.
        So there's always motivation to do it even when it's difficult. But yeah,
        I think I'm a bit more pessimistic, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.</p><p>So
        I always say I'm a hopeless optimist. I don't think things are going well,
        but I'm always optimistic that we can do better.</p><p>[00:21:28] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> Again, we. We really should organize a podcast for the 10
        years in the future and see, you know, where we end up.</p><p>[00:21:37] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> So if you want to sign up for the Zoom on, what is it?</p><p>[00:21:41]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> 2034</p><p>[00:21:44] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong>
        Then you know, find no zoom link in the, in the show notes,</p><p>[00:21:49]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> Hopefully we've moved on from Zoom in that
        period of time.</p><p>[00:21:54] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Google
        Meet.</p><p>But I think that we probably are, are best at rounding up with
        with this episode. So there's lots to say about early career researchers,
        junior researchers really outnumbering senior researchers. Maybe in 10 years
        that won't be the case anymore. Maybe funds will be distributed differently.
        Maybe, professorships will be more widely used as long as you get the responsibilities
        of supervision, which I know that people are trying to get towards.</p><p>But
        in essence, there's lots of work to do. And so if there's anything that people
        feel like should really be trained for junior researchers, like they should
        be provided more resources to do. We'd be very happy to hear those. We'd very
        happy to share those out because there's plenty of people shifting into supervisory
        positions that can use clear and communicative resources to get started as
        we discussed last episode.</p><p>Thank you for joining another episode of
        the Open Update. We'll put the link to the signal group in the show notes
        so that you can share any further thoughts that you might have.</p><p>Otherwise,

        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Hi, and welcome to the Open Update. I'm
        Chris Hartgerink for Liberate Science, joined by Sarahanne Field, here in
        Berlin still,</p><p>[00:00:05] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> Hello.</p><p>[00:00:07]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> though we're recording all of this in one
        day and sharing those episodes so she's not been in Berlin all these.</p><p>[00:00:13]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I've been in Berlin for two months. Yes.</p><p>[00:00:16]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> So we've been doing this entire series
        of episodes on the history of open science over the past decade, how we've
        experienced it, and also looking forward into the magic crystal ball about
        what we want to happen in the next 10 years.</p><p>And one of the things we
        ended the last episode on was also this question of does the burden of open
        science or open research or just in general, improving research practices
        fall mostly on early career researchers or junior researchers.</p><p>There's
        an argument to be made that most of the research that gets published gets
        done by junior researchers. 20% or something of junior researchers end up
        getting tenure. So there's also a four to one for junior researchers to tenured
        researchers. The masses , the labor force is also primarily junior researchers.</p><p>So
        from that we might logically conclude that yes, most of the burden of improving
        research practice falls on junior researchers because they are the practicing
        researchers. But with that, I think Sarahanne, you had some ideas around this.
        I've already very quickly scratched the surface that I think yes, that is
        the case.</p><p>Now that you're sort of, you're transitioning from junior
        to mid-career researcher, do you feel like you're being unburdened then in
        terms of improving research practices?</p><p>[00:01:42] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> The thing is that I never felt pressure in the first place.
        I found meta research, fell in love with it, and have committed myself to
        acting, thinking, speaking, practicing in a certain way. Coming back to, to
        the theme of this series, this idea of, looking back and, and looking forward,
        I think we're in a different generation now. I think the generation maybe
        you and I began our research trajectories within, I think it was a different
        story to what it is now.</p><p>I think we're seeing a lot of the ECR starting
        to mature into roles where they are teaching, supervising in large groups
        of students, whereas 10 years ago, a lot of us were, were just starting. Obviously,
        the meta researchers that we engage with, they're coming from all different,
        you know, career stages.</p><p>But I get the sense, from my own experience,
        my knowledge that a lot of people have who are now teaching and now supervising,
        have grown up in a world a, a research sphere where meta research openness
        is a little more commonplace.</p><p>So I think we have a different burden
        now. It is not so much the burden of learning those practices ourselves, but
        it's the burden of passing those on. I find it very exciting. I find that
        responsibility very important. It's one that I take really seriously. I do
        think that that previously a lot of the burden fell on the ECRs, and I wonder
        if looking forward if that's still gonna be the case.</p><p>[00:03:17] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> If I understand correctly, because the practices have
        become more established, that it's no longer as much a burden for the people
        who grew, quote unquote, \\\"grew up\\\" academically with this, and now the
        burden is more sharing that knowledge and upskilling.</p><p>From my experience,
        it's junior researchers who are at the end of the open science policies that
        get implemented. They're the ones responsible for ultimately publishing the
        open data, making sure everything is correct, everything is up to date, figuring
        out how, if there is a mistake, how to update it, creating, understanding
        how, get repositories work and how you could sync them with Zenodo. Something,
        the PIs might not even know anything about, so that the junior researchers
        really are the ones handholding the senior researchers.</p><p>This problem
        of the lack of training trajectories in implementing these open science policies
        because it ends up on the professor's plate and they just, Throw it onto the
        junior researchers, figure it out.</p><p>We had this, when I was still at
        Tilburg University, there was a data audit procedure and it was like, there
        is now a data audit procedure. They phased it in. But I mean, if you're not
        subjected to part of the pilot period, you wouldn't get any additional training.
        And then subsequently at the very end, you know, I had to supply data packages
        for audits for each of my dissertation chapters. And nobody even actually
        mentioned this before I was done. So if I had not done this practice myself
        already, I would have to catch up, at that moment. So there's this point of
        all these policies getting implemented, but the training not being there,
        and I think there's also literally this question of what are the training
        needs as a result of these policies?</p><p>[00:05:17] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong>
        This comes back to something you said last episode. The communication, the
        clarity of communication, being really essential. When you start a PhD, at
        least in my experience, you. There's, there's so much onus on the beginning,
        getting your idea for the papers set up, if you're doing it by, by publication,
        getting the proposal approved, getting the idea, you're excited about this
        idea.</p><p>The, the absolute last thing as a PhD, new PhD candidate that
        you are thinking about is what your data package at the end of the end of
        the whole process is gonna look like and how you're gonna do it. This comes
        also back to onboarding, you know, when it comes to, to keeping your practices
        responsible and open.</p><p>Just being really clear with, with new researchers
        as they come into the business, to sort of make it super clear what's expected
        of them and keep that in the back of their minds. Coach 'em as they go through.
        Remember, we've just finished a paper. Keep in mind that you are gonna need
        a folder. For this data, these materials, the README or the code book or whatever,
        that's gonna need to be in your data package when you submit, before you can
        defend.</p><p>But one tension I think is the fact that the PI tends to be
        the one that signs off for responsibility of a lot of research in labs that
        gets conducted, but they're often not the ones who are making the protocols,
        putting them online, collecting the data, making the metadata. That's something
        that I think is sort of a little bit in tension at least sometimes.</p><p>[00:06:57]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Interesting that you see that as tension,
        because I would like when you say this, I'm, I'm detaching this from the academic
        environment for a second. The supervisor on a factory floor is responsible
        for everybody on the factory floor. Yet there, this is not an, not quote unquote
        \\\"an issue\\\" because it's very clear that there's a certain responsibility
        and that processes need to be in place to ensure that.</p><p>That you can't
        just say, well, I didn't know because you, you're responsible for it. So you
        have to know. So in that scenario, you have to put in place processes to make
        sure that you know, and if you don't, then that's, that's the failing of the
        supervisor on the factory floor. And I think it's the same in an academic
        setting. 'cause there's so much just. Do X, do Y, but there's no reporting
        back or ensuring documentation, insufficient places that decisions get documented,
        that there's consistent evaluation procedures. So in that sense it definitely
        will amplify any of those frictions that exist, well exist because the, the
        procedures are lacking. I would argue that's not too hard, but the culture
        is very much laissez-faire. Like you figure it out, we'll do whatever. And
        I think this is also part of the problem that we got to earlier with the,
        with the policies and the implementation is, you know, all of this, it's not
        a static thing. You can read a policy document once, think you understand
        it, just like a law, but the law and the, then the policy keeps changing and
        I think there's a certain responsibility.</p><p>To, for organizations to indicate
        what is changing, how it is changing, and then also certain, responsibility
        to then, you know, pass that information on. Maybe the defense regulations
        change a month before you submit your dissertation, you're still subject to
        those new regulations or new policy. There needs to be a mechanism to get
        informed about that, whether that is the supervisor, like instructing all
        the supervisors, Hey, don't forget, instruct your PhDs that this, this, and
        this was changing otherwise your timeline might be at risk or that there is
        a clear mechanism for that information just to be shared, university-wide.</p><p>And
        so in that sense, all to say is, are there sufficient procedures and quality
        assurance processes pretty much in place to make sure that when stuff changes,
        the burden is accounted for somewhere. Because if you don't plan for it, what,
        what is the famous saying? If you don't plan for success, you plan for failure
        or something,</p><p>[00:09:51] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> You accept
        failure or something like that? Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>But I think what you're
        saying, a lot of that can just be boiled down if you want to, to communication,
        right? Regular communication. Clear communication. Fair communication that
        goes both ways.</p><p>That comes back to sort of my, my thoughts or my concerns
        about. ECRs being lumped with a lot of the work of responsible conduct of
        open research.</p><p>I don't, I mean, obviously the issues with equity exist.
        Giving an ECR a lot of this extra methodological work, for example, or this
        extra labor is, is problematic in itself. But I think is also the problem
        of the fact that it's not communicated clearly at the start that that's even
        necessarily their role.</p><p>There's no expectation management really there.
        So when things have to be done because of a university policy, for example,
        or some requirement, it's like, oh, here's that work. It's foisting it off
        onto them, or, or passing the buck to them rather than that being, you know,
        an, an agreement at the start of.</p><p>Supervision or at the start of some
        kind of working relationship discussion about whose role is then I would argue
        as someone who's a strong proponent for widespread responsible conduct of
        research that it's each researcher's individual responsibility and in that
        sense that the responsibility is uniformly distributed across a research team.</p><p>But
        there's an extent to which that that can't always be the case. So for example,
        in big team science, Not every single person can be reasonably expected to
        have gone through all of the aspects, for example, of an analysis, especially
        if it's not their specialization, if they can't understand that analysis well.
        There are exceptions to that of course, but I'm saying as a general rule in
        a supervisor student relationship, for example, that responsibility being
        equally divided, you know, the person who has to sign off on the research
        has a responsibility to know what the subordinate or the student is doing.</p><p>And
        the student who is doing a lot of the research needs to, there needs to be
        clearer communication. They are also responsible, but they're, you know, in
        that relationship, they have a shared responsibility.</p><p>[00:12:06] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> I hear you on the individual responsibility and of course
        like Almost a communal responsibility towards each other. There's of course
        always the flip side of sort of what is the system they're in precarious positions,
        overload of students, overflowing with teaching responsibilities. So there's
        also that aspect of, are sufficient resources available to do all of the work,
        or is the amount of resources or the amount of work that's required, is that
        already more than the work week to begin with?</p><p>So there's also a certain
        aspect there where literally respecting the work hours and being realistic
        in the estimates and the planning would be worthwhile. I personally feel if
        you allot four hours of supervision time, every week , it should be clear
        that they should only be allowed to supervise a certain amount of students
        on their own. If they're supervising with two people needs to be clear what
        the division is, whether it's 50 50 or not, and then really manage and plan
        that time to say, okay, you now have five PhD students at a hundred percent
        capacity. That means that half a week is already gone for the entire year,
        like you need to plan for that. So then if you have 20 hours a week of teaching,
        that's it. Nothing extra anymore, but taking that kind of resource management
        seriously isn't done because the gaps would be astronomical because I mean,
        how many PIs do you know who supervise more, more than five people?</p><p>[00:13:44]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> You, you hear this? I mean, PhD students.
        To saying, oh, I, I don't get even ever able to talk to my supervisor because
        they just don't have time. They have too many students. You hear this? That's
        all the time.</p><p>[00:13:55] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> That's already
        a problem big enough, because that literally means figure it out. Whether
        that's open research practices or just in general how to do anything. And
        I know situations where people were literally delayed with getting their PhD
        for. I don't know, six months a year, because they just hadn't read the latest
        version that only needed to be edited for, you know, minor sentence or minor
        corrections.</p><p>[00:14:20] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I, I think
        that's, that's certainly a thing that going forward has to be addressed better.
        This comes back to the, the kind of research culture that the research reform
        movement is trying to develop is, is things like this that make the workplace
        an acceptable place for junior researchers to flourish and to develop. You
        know, I mean, we get super high attrition and part of that is things like
        this.</p><p>[00:14:46] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> This also immediately
        goes to the core of the issue, right? Because if we, again, dissociate from
        the research space for a moment, it's about there's a certain amount of labor
        energy. And if we manage that effectively, the gap would become very clear
        and the exploitation would become very clear how you're not getting compensated
        for the amount of effort you're putting in.</p><p>So if you do overtime at
        an organization that is gonna benefit somebody else, if you're not getting
        paid for it. Within research, we very often say, but it's my passion. We're
        internally motivated. And that's how you balance it out, and then you might
        get some reputation for it Instead, if you, you know, you become a professor
        Wow. And you get a PhD. Wow.</p><p>It's not an accident that this management
        of the time and the, the planning for it is not built in. And so there is
        this question of are we gonna recognize that this is not a problem that came
        unintentionally, but it's by, not any individual's design, but it is an intended
        effect and that is not gonna go away by accident either.</p><p>[00:16:00]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> So what you've just said is extremely dark
        to me, partly because it's so recognizable and it's so endemic. The whole
        idea that this is an intentional thing. That, that it's not an accident. You
        know, the idea that a, a university relies on the fact that people don't tend
        to do the math and stick to it. That is especially dark for me because I personally
        feel like I have the confidence to be able to deal with this in my workplace.</p><p>I
        feel like I'm confident enough and self-assured enough that I can make my
        own boundaries in my workplace. But, coming back to sort of the overarching
        theme of this podcast season, when you have someone who's acting in a work
        relationship where they are subordinate based on their, their say, their career
        stage. For them being able to manage the expectations of their supervisor.
        It's not a trivial thing for them to say \\\"I'm, I don't want to email you
        on the weekend.\\\" If for, for so many, for example, first or second year,
        PhD researchers, that would be an incredibly difficult line to draw in the
        sand and say, these are my boundaries. I'm gonna defend them.</p><p>Even just
        making those boundaries in the first place clear would be very scary. Let
        alone defending them, especially if you have a supervisor who wants to be
        violating them. So I think that is something as ECRs it's, it's really difficult
        to navigate these toxic problems in, in the academic sphere because it is
        so just, it permeates everything.</p><p>Our, our whole sort of culture, how
        we mentally deal with the workload, what our expectations are. But again,
        just coming back to this sort of sub theme is a micro theme of, of this clarity
        of communication, expectation management.</p><p>[00:17:53] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong>
        It's not all doom and gloom because there's also plenty of work in that space
        where it's like responsible conduct of research, role modeling. It's Dr. Tamarinde
        Haven, for example, about this work on, well, role modeling really matters.
        If the PIs have pre-registered work or pre-printed the PhD candidate is more
        likely to do that behavior as well. Whether that's because of teaching or
        bio osmosis or whatever, that's irrelevant, but it is a relation there. That
        could be very similar with respecting just private time, planning your work
        properly.</p><p>It makes a lot of sense. PIs end up very often not always
        being bosses and mentors as well. You learn certain behaviors from them. How
        do you do certain things? Because supposedly they're present. Not all of them
        are, but they have the skills that you're trying to learn, so it makes sense
        that you learn them from them in a certain way. And so, especially PhD Candidates,
        very often for people it's their first step into a certain work environment
        that goes beyond just literally being a student.</p><p>Sometimes it feels
        like people who are in those positions, they don't recognize that they're
        role modeling regardless. So also indeed having that space for them to understand
        what kind of role model do I want to be is incredibly important. But yeah,
        if you're running 10 PhD students a month like you don't really have much
        time except if you really plan for just doing that.</p><p>[00:19:26] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> That is why I am excited and optimistic, maybe more than is
        warranted about, say, the next 10 years, and why I don't think necessarily
        that stagnation is a, a big risk in a lot of ways is that I see so many of
        my cohort, for example, people that I did my PhD at the same time as who are
        now walking into faculty positions who are starting to supervise students.</p><p>Their
        approach to these things, their philosophy about conducting research, about
        the research culture that they wanna see different. There are so many mindsets
        here that are really positive that will be passed, even just osmotically down
        to the next generation of researchers. I'm really excited about that and I
        know that there are loads of great supervisors in our supervisors generation,
        for example, who are now full profs or even emeritus. They also had great
        mindsets, but I think, I do believe that there is a culture shift here that
        is slowly starting to creep into some, some ways of working, maybe not always
        successfully and meaningfully and, you know, with longevity.</p><p>But I do
        see positive change and I guess I have to be optimistic about that if I wanna
        stay in academia.</p><p>[00:20:38] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Well,
        I'm glad that we balance each other out in that sense because I think that
        for, for me personally, of course, I'm outside of this environment, so take
        everything I say with a grain of salt. But On an individual level, I can agree.
        On a systems level, I sometimes feel like the the friction is getting more
        and more amplified.</p><p>So that it doesn't matter as much what the individual
        can or wants to do. Not to say they can't make a change. I think in that sense,
        you know operating based on your principles can really have a ripple effect.
        So there's always motivation to do it even when it's difficult. But yeah,
        I think I'm a bit more pessimistic, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.</p><p>So
        I always say I'm a hopeless optimist. I don't think things are going well,
        but I'm always optimistic that we can do better.</p><p>[00:21:28] <strong>Sarahanne
        Field:</strong> Again, we. We really should organize a podcast for the 10
        years in the future and see, you know, where we end up.</p><p>[00:21:37] <strong>Chris

        period of time.</p><p>[00:21:54] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Google
        Meet.</p><p>But I think that we probably are, are best at rounding up with
        with this episode. So there's lots to say about early career researchers,
        junior researchers really outnumbering senior researchers. Maybe in 10 years
        that won't be the case anymore. Maybe funds will be distributed differently.
        Maybe, professorships will be more widely used as long as you get the responsibilities
        of supervision, which I know that people are trying to get towards.</p><p>But
        in essence, there's lots of work to do. And so if there's anything that people
        feel like should really be trained for junior researchers, like they should
        be provided more resources to do. We'd be very happy to hear those. We'd very
        happy to share those out because there's plenty of people shifting into supervisory
        positions that can use clear and communicative resources to get started as
        we discussed last episode.</p><p>Thank you for joining another episode of

        href=\\\"https://quarto.org\\\">Quarto</a> is a great tool for reproducible
        research. It is also a great tool for building websites. After about a decade
        of Wordpress-based websites, I\u2019ve moved to Quarto primarily for two reasons.
        First, most of my content is largely static. I don\u2019t quite need the full
        power of a CMS, and the performance cost of dynamic generation I didn\u2019t
        need was quite steep (the economic cost was nothing special, but I\u2019m
        a cheapskate). Second, I wanted to be able to write in Markdown and integrate
        better with notebooks. Quarto lets me do both of these.</p>\\n<p>What Quarto
        also does, however, is something super awesome: project scripts!</p>\\n<section
        id=\\\"project-whats\\\" class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Project whats?</h1>\\n<p>A
        project script in Quarto is, basically, <a href=\\\"https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html\\\">a
        piece of Python, Lua, R or Typescript code that is executed at some point
        during rendering</a>. This is super useful, because it allows you to do things
        like, say, automatically generate a list of publications from a BibTeX file
        \u2013 which is among others what I\u2019m using it for. Essentially any programmatic
        function can be implemented in a project script.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"cell\\\"

        Rendering pipeline in Quarto with pre- and post-render scripts.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Quarto
        distinguishes between pre-render and post-render scripts. No prizes for guessing
        the difference, but here it goes: pre-render scripts are executed before the
        page is rendered, and post-render scripts are executed after the page is rendered.
        Pre-render scripts are particularly useful as they can modify the source <code>.qmd</code>
        (Quarto markdown) files before rendering them to HTML or whatever their ultimate
        evolutionary destiny is.</p>\\n<p>To make project scripts work, you need to
        declare them in your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"sourceCode\\\"

        list</h1>\\n<p>On my website, I use Quarto project scripts to maintain a <a
        href=\\\"papers\\\">list of my papers</a>. This list is generated from a BibTeX
        file, which makes it a little more convenient to maintain my publications,
        and somewhat future-proofed in case I want a different format.<sup>1</sup></p>\\n<p>You

        class=\\\"figure-caption\\\">Figure&nbsp;2: My super clumsy pre-render script
        to build my bibliography.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>We
        load a BibTeX file (<code>load_bibtex_file()</code>), parse it, use a function
        to determine whether we\u2019re rendering a book or an article entry (I don\u2019
        have any other types of publications, but if I did, I\u2019d add them here),
        and dispatch rendering to the appropriate function (<code>render_article_as_nlm()</code>
        for articles, <code>render_book_as_nlm()</code> for books). We sort the entries
        into a Markdown format with years separated by level 1 headings (<code>generate_list_by_year()</code>)
        and finally write it into the <code>papers/index.qmd</code> file (<code>write_into_file()</code>).
        There\u2019s some minor magic going on behind the scenes, such as capturing
        my name and setting it in bold (which is a bit of a convention in academic
        lists of publications), but that\u2019s the gist of it.</p>\\n<p>The result
        is a list of publications that is automatically generated from a BibTeX file,
        and is always up to date (as up to date as the BibTeX file, anyway). I don\u2019t
        have to manually update it\u2026 sort of.</p>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"wait-automagically-updated\\\"
        class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Wait, automagically updated?</h1>\\n<p>The second
        half of what makes project scripts awesome is that they integrate with the
        rendering process. If the rendering process in turn integrates with some CI
        that watches for changes, then you can have a website that is automatically
        updated whenever you push a change to the repository. This is what I do with
        my website: I have a GitHub action that watches for changes to the <code>main</code>
        branch, and if it detects a change, it runs the rendering process and pushes
        the result to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. This means that if I were
        to change the BibTeX file, it would trigger a re-render, and the list of publications
        would be automatically updated.</p>\\n<p>There are some tricks to keep in
        mind here. Most importantly, because this requires some custom Python packages,
        I had to slightly amend my Github publishing workflow:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"cell\\\"
        data-layout-align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"cell-output-display\\\">\\n<div

        -r requirements.txt\\\")\\n    D --&gt; E[\\\"quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\\\"]\\n
        \   style D stroke-width:8px;\\n    style C stroke-width:8px;\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<figcaption
        class=\\\"figure-caption\\\">Figure&nbsp;3: Integrating the pre-render script
        into the Github Actions CI/CD framework. The parts that need to be integrated
        into the publishing workflow are highlighted with bold outlines.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>In
        particular, I had to explicitly specify the Python version and install the
        requirements. This is because the <code>quarto-actions/setup</code> action
        does not install the requirements, and the <code>quarto-actions/publish</code>
        action does not install Python. This is admittedly a bit of a nuisance to
        work around, but really not all that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.</p>\\n<p>One
        thing to keep in mind when writing your script is the context from which it
        will be executed. In particular, if you\u2019re using a CI/CD pipeline, you
        will need to make sure that the script can find the files it needs. In my
        case, I had to explicitly specify the path to the BibTeX file, as well as
        the path to the output file. This is because the script is executed from the
        root of the repository, but the BibTeX file is in the <code>papers</code>
        directory, and the output file is in the <code>papers</code> directory, too.
        Testing locally for deployment in CI/CD is notoriously hellish, but with a
        little bit of elbow grease,<sup>2</sup> you can get it to work.</p>\\n<p>One
        caveat: rendering with pre- and post-render project scripts may be relatively
        expensive in terms of time. My silly SkiErg world record script adds a good
        20-25 seconds of processing time to each rendering run \u2013 not a lot, but
        it does stack up eventually. The <a href=\\\"https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html\\\">documentation</a>
        helpfully discloses that Quarto provides an environment variable, <code>QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL</code>,
        which is set to <code>1</code> if it\u2019s a full render. It may make sense
        to do a more manual caching here.</p>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"things-you-can-do-with-project-scripts\\\"
        class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Things you can do with project scripts</h1>\\n<p>Seriously,
        the possibilities of what you can do with project scripts are pretty much
        endless. I have a project script that <a href=\\\"https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/chrisvoncsefalvay.github.io/blob/main/scripts/pre_check_skierg_records.py\\\">checks
        the world records list on the official SkiErg website and makes sure my index
        page lists my accurate records</a>. This is completely silly, but it\u2019s
        also a great example of how you can use project scripts to automate just about
        everything:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A lot of projects use it for housekeeping: <a
        href=\\\"https://github.com/CSCAR/workshop-stata-intro/blob/main/Makefile\\\">via
        makefiles</a></li>\\n<li>The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bambinos/bambi\\\">bambi</a>
        project uses it to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/main/docs/pre_render.py\\\">build
        a changelog</a>, which is a great idea for applications that do need it</li>\\n<li>This
        one cool master\u2019s thesis uses pre-render project scripts to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/danielvartan/mastersthesis/blob/bebb699af7cab7add37a33768ccd605a60a18ba8/R/quarto-pre-render-html.R#L82\\\">load
        variables from a YAML file into envvars</a>, and I\u2019ve <a href=\\\"https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension/blob/main/prerender.R\\\">seen
        the same done with Rprofile files</a> \u2013 obviously, these are much more
        pertinent to projects where the bulk of the project consists of notebooks/code
        execution rather than websites, but again, the idea is the same</li>\\n<li>Obviously,
        I\u2019m not the only one to use it for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nfrerebeau/rarcheo/blob/master/_references.R\\\">reference
        management</a></li>\\n<li>You can use it to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book/blob/main/Makefile\\\">download
        static content into your project</a>, too!</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The sky\u2019s
        the limit! I\u2019m currently working on rendering my CV from a JSON file
        via a project script, as well as a few other cool things. I keep my project
        scripts <a href=\\\"https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/chrisvoncsefalvay.github.io/tree/main/scripts\\\">here</a>
        \u2013 I hope they will inspire you to do something cool with your own project

        to Quarto primarily for two reasons. First, most of my content is largely
        static. I don\u2019t quite need the full power of a CMS, and the performance
        cost of dynamic generation I didn\u2019t need was quite steep (the economic
        cost was nothing special, but I\u2019m a cheapskate). Second, I wanted to
        be able to write in Markdown and integrate better with notebooks. Quarto lets
        me do both of these.</p>\\n<p>What Quarto also does, however, is something
        super awesome: project scripts!</p>\\n<section id=\\\"project-whats\\\" class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Project
        whats?</h1>\\n<p>A project script in Quarto is, basically, <a href=\\\"https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html\\\">a
        piece of Python, Lua, R or Typescript code that is executed at some point
        during rendering</a>. This is super useful, because it allows you to do things
        like, say, automatically generate a list of publications from a BibTeX file
        \u2013 which is among others what I\u2019m using it for. Essentially any programmatic
        function can be implemented in a project script.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"cell\\\"

        Rendering pipeline in Quarto with pre- and post-render scripts.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>Quarto
        distinguishes between pre-render and post-render scripts. No prizes for guessing
        the difference, but here it goes: pre-render scripts are executed before the
        page is rendered, and post-render scripts are executed after the page is rendered.
        Pre-render scripts are particularly useful as they can modify the source <code>.qmd</code>
        (Quarto markdown) files before rendering them to HTML or whatever their ultimate
        evolutionary destiny is.</p>\\n<p>To make project scripts work, you need to
        declare them in your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"sourceCode\\\"

        class=\\\"figure-caption\\\">Figure&nbsp;2: My super clumsy pre-render script
        to build my bibliography.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>We
        load a BibTeX file (<code>load_bibtex_file()</code>), parse it, use a function
        to determine whether we\u2019re rendering a book or an article entry (I don\u2019
        have any other types of publications, but if I did, I\u2019d add them here),
        and dispatch rendering to the appropriate function (<code>render_article_as_nlm()</code>
        for articles, <code>render_book_as_nlm()</code> for books). We sort the entries
        into a Markdown format with years separated by level 1 headings (<code>generate_list_by_year()</code>)
        and finally write it into the <code>papers/index.qmd</code> file (<code>write_into_file()</code>).
        There\u2019s some minor magic going on behind the scenes, such as capturing
        my name and setting it in bold (which is a bit of a convention in academic
        lists of publications), but that\u2019s the gist of it.</p>\\n<p>The result
        is a list of publications that is automatically generated from a BibTeX file,
        and is always up to date (as up to date as the BibTeX file, anyway). I don\u2019t
        have to manually update it\u2026 sort of.</p>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"wait-automagically-updated\\\"
        class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Wait, automagically updated?</h1>\\n<p>The second
        half of what makes project scripts awesome is that they integrate with the
        rendering process. If the rendering process in turn integrates with some CI
        that watches for changes, then you can have a website that is automatically
        updated whenever you push a change to the repository. This is what I do with
        my website: I have a GitHub action that watches for changes to the <code>main</code>
        branch, and if it detects a change, it runs the rendering process and pushes
        the result to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. This means that if I were
        to change the BibTeX file, it would trigger a re-render, and the list of publications
        would be automatically updated.</p>\\n<p>There are some tricks to keep in
        mind here. Most importantly, because this requires some custom Python packages,
        I had to slightly amend my Github publishing workflow:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"cell\\\"
        data-layout-align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"cell-output-display\\\">\\n<div

        \   style D stroke-width:8px;\\n    style C stroke-width:8px;\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<figcaption
        class=\\\"figure-caption\\\">Figure&nbsp;3: Integrating the pre-render script
        into the Github Actions CI/CD framework. The parts that need to be integrated
        into the publishing workflow are highlighted with bold outlines.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>In
        particular, I had to explicitly specify the Python version and install the
        requirements. This is because the <code>quarto-actions/setup</code> action
        does not install the requirements, and the <code>quarto-actions/publish</code>
        action does not install Python. This is admittedly a bit of a nuisance to
        work around, but really not all that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.</p>\\n<p>One
        thing to keep in mind when writing your script is the context from which it
        will be executed. In particular, if you\u2019re using a CI/CD pipeline, you
        will need to make sure that the script can find the files it needs. In my
        case, I had to explicitly specify the path to the BibTeX file, as well as
        the path to the output file. This is because the script is executed from the
        root of the repository, but the BibTeX file is in the <code>papers</code>
        directory, and the output file is in the <code>papers</code> directory, too.
        Testing locally for deployment in CI/CD is notoriously hellish, but with a
        little bit of elbow grease,<sup>2</sup> you can get it to work.</p>\\n<p>One
        caveat: rendering with pre- and post-render project scripts may be relatively
        expensive in terms of time. My silly SkiErg world record script adds a good
        20-25 seconds of processing time to each rendering run \u2013 not a lot, but
        it does stack up eventually. The <a href=\\\"https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html\\\">documentation</a>
        helpfully discloses that Quarto provides an environment variable, <code>QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL</code>,
        which is set to <code>1</code> if it\u2019s a full render. It may make sense
        to do a more manual caching here.</p>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\\\"things-you-can-do-with-project-scripts\\\"
        class=\\\"level1\\\">\\n<h1>Things you can do with project scripts</h1>\\n<p>Seriously,
        the possibilities of what you can do with project scripts are pretty much
        endless. I have a project script that <a href=\\\"https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/chrisvoncsefalvay.github.io/blob/main/scripts/pre_check_skierg_records.py\\\">checks
        the world records list on the official SkiErg website and makes sure my index
        page lists my accurate records</a>. This is completely silly, but it\u2019s
        also a great example of how you can use project scripts to automate just about
        everything:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A lot of projects use it for housekeeping: <a
        href=\\\"https://github.com/CSCAR/workshop-stata-intro/blob/main/Makefile\\\">via
        makefiles</a></li>\\n<li>The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bambinos/bambi\\\">bambi</a>
        project uses it to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/main/docs/pre_render.py\\\">build
        a changelog</a>, which is a great idea for applications that do need it</li>\\n<li>This
        one cool master\u2019s thesis uses pre-render project scripts to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/danielvartan/mastersthesis/blob/bebb699af7cab7add37a33768ccd605a60a18ba8/R/quarto-pre-render-html.R#L82\\\">load
        variables from a YAML file into envvars</a>, and I\u2019ve <a href=\\\"https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension/blob/main/prerender.R\\\">seen
        the same done with Rprofile files</a> \u2013 obviously, these are much more
        pertinent to projects where the bulk of the project consists of notebooks/code
        execution rather than websites, but again, the idea is the same</li>\\n<li>Obviously,
        I\u2019m not the only one to use it for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nfrerebeau/rarcheo/blob/master/_references.R\\\">reference
        management</a></li>\\n<li>You can use it to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book/blob/main/Makefile\\\">download
        static content into your project</a>, too!</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The sky\u2019s
        the limit! I\u2019m currently working on rendering my CV from a JSON file
        via a project script, as well as a few other cool things. I keep my project
        scripts <a href=\\\"https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/chrisvoncsefalvay.github.io/tree/main/scripts\\\">here</a>
        \u2013 I hope they will inspire you to do something cool with your own project

        and they need to accept the co-author to list them on the page. Finally, the
        profile page only displays the first 20 co-authors. Any further co-authors
        can be seen by clicking &#8220;View All&#8221;. As I understand it, there
        is a limit to the number of co-authors a primary author is allowed to have;
        I currently have 40 and haven&#8217;t yet hit a limit. The ranking of co-authors

        There are authors whose distance is not in ranked order with their neighbours.

        accurate, or perhaps zero-cited papers are excluded from the paper count.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        tried this simple strategy on a few other primary authors and could replicate

        can be seen by clicking &#8220;View All&#8221;. As I understand it, there
        is a limit to the number of co-authors a primary author is allowed to have;
        I currently have 40 and haven&#8217;t yet hit a limit. The ranking of co-authors

        package to get the data. The primary author used in the package vignette is
        Albert Einstein, but he doesn&#8217;t have any co-authors on Google Scholar;

        There are authors whose distance is not in ranked order with their neighbours.
        On closer inspection it seems that the number of co-authored papers is not
        accurate, or perhaps zero-cited papers are excluded from the paper count.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        tried this simple strategy on a few other primary authors and could replicate
        their co-authors&#8217; rank order. I&#8217;m not certain this is the algorithm
        used but it certainly seems simple enough to be readily computed on each profile
        page.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>So the total co-citations and the number of
        co-authored papers is used to compute the rank of co-authors</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Not
        every co-author is a Scholar co-author. Some don&#8217;t have accounts for
        example. Knowing how the ranking is done, we can ask <strong>which lucky co-author
        could slot into the top co-author spots on my page</strong>, if they made

        list\u201D</a> of reactions for organic chemistry, describing five hypothetical
        reactions which were particularly desirable for medicinal chemistry. A few
        recent papers brought this back to my mind, so I revisited the list with the
        aim of seeing what progress had been made. (Note that I am judging these based
        solely by memory, and accordingly I will certainly omit work that I ought
        to know about\u2014sorry!)</p><h3><strong>Fluorination</strong></h3><blockquote><p>1.
        Fluorination \u2013 Exchanging a specific hydrogen for a fluorine atom in
        molecules with many functional groups. A reaction that installs a difluoromethyl
        group would be nice too.</p></blockquote><p>This is still hard! To my knowledge,
        no progress has really been made towards this goal in a general sense (although
        plenty of isolated fluorination reactions are still reported, many of which
        are useful).</p><p>C\u2013H fluorination is particularly challenging because
        separating C\u2013H and C\u2013F compounds can be quite difficult. (Fluorine
        is often considered a hydrogen bioisostere, which is nice from a design perspective
        but annoying from a <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac403376h\\\">chromatography</a>
        perspective.) For this reason, I\u2019m more optimistic about methods that
        go through separable intermediates than the article\u2019s author: \u201Cinstalling
        another reactive group\u2026 and exchanging it for fluorine\u201D may not
        be particularly ideal in the Baran sense, but my guess is that this strategy
        will be more fruitful than direct C\u2013H fluorination for a long while yet.</p><h3><strong>Heteroatom
        Alkylation</strong></h3><blockquote><p>2. Heteroatom alkylation \u2013 A reaction
        that \u2013 selectively \u2013 attaches an alkyl group onto one heteroatom
        in rings that have several, such as pyrazoles, triazoles and pyridones.</p></blockquote><p>This
        problem is still unsolved. Lloyd-Jones published some nice work on <a href=\\\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b02786\\\">triazole
        alkylation</a> a few weeks after the ChemistryWorld article came out, but
        otherwise it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a problem that people in academia
        are thinking much about.</p><p>Unlike some of the others, this challenge seems
        ideally suited to organocatalysis, so maybe someone else in that subfield
        will start working on it. (Our work on <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04958-w\\\">site-selective
        glycosylation</a> might be relevant?)</p><p><strong>EDIT: I missed <a href=\\\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202014239\\\">extremely

        pyrazoles with haloalkanes (and cites the ChemistryWorld article directly).

        Carbon coupling \u2013 A reaction as robust and versatile as traditional cross
        coupling for stitching together aliphatic carbon atoms \u2013 ideally with
        control of chirality, too. Chemists also want more options for the kinds of
        molecules they can use as coupling precursors.</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s

        Making and modifying heterocycles \u2013 A reaction to install functional
        groups \u2013 from alkyl to halogen \u2013 anywhere on aromatic and aliphatic
        heterocycles, such as pyridine, piperidine or isoxazole. Reactions that can
        make completely new heterocycles from scratch would be a bonus.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m
        not a big fan of the way this goal is written\u2014virtually every structure
        in medicinal chemistry has a heterocycle, so \u201Cmaking and modifying heterocycles\u201D
        is just too vague. What would a general solution even look like?</p><p>Nevertheless,

        Atom swapping \u2013 A reaction that can exchange individual atoms selectively,
        like swapping a carbon for a nitrogen atom in a ring. This chemical version
        of gene editing could revolutionise drug discovery, but is probably furthest

        Burns</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adj5331\\\">Mark
        Levin</a> have both published papers converting benzene rings directly to
        pyridines recently. More broadly, lots of organic chemists are getting interested
        in \u201Cskeletal editing\u201D (i.e. modifying the skeleton of a molecule,
        not the periphery), which seems like exactly what this goal is describing.

        the original article, given that it\u2019s only been four years (less than
        the average length of a PhD!). Organic methodology is a very exciting field
        right now: data is easy to acquire, there are lots of problems to work on,
        and there seems to be genuine interest from adjacent fields about the technologies
        being developed. Still, if the toughest challenges in the field\u2019s imagination

        id=\\\"multilingual-publishing\\\">Multilingual Publishing</h4><p>As global
        movements, Open Source and Open Science face language-based exclusion as most
        resources are in English. This affects scientists and research software engineers
        working in R, particularly those who don\u2019t have English as their first
        language.</p><p>rOpenSci multilingual efforts aim to lower access barriers,
        democratize quality resources, and increase the possibilities of contributing
        to open software and science. We successfully piloted our Spanish-language
        peer review and the localization to Spanish of our comprehensive guide to
        software development, with Portuguese translation underway.</p><p><a href=\\\"/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/\\\">Ma\xEBlle

        the rOpenSci Multilingual project details on this call. Ma\xEBlle will present
        the R packages that allow us to have our content in several languages. Then
        Elio and Paola will share the translation workflow and show the Translation
