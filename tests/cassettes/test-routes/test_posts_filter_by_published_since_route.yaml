        I described how\\nthe curly-arrows describing the mechanism of a nucleophilic
        addition at\\na carbonyl group choreograph in two distinct ways, as seen in
        red or\\nblue below. The arrows in red can be described as firstly addition
        to\\nthe carbonyl group to form either a transient intermediate (a two-step\\nprocess)
        or instead a formal transition state state as a concerted\\nsingle-step mechanism.
        The blue arrows do the reverse; firstly\\nelimination and then followed by
        addition. I will use the shorthand\\n**AE** for the first type and **EA**
        for the second type. Here I explore\\nsome more nucleophiles to see which
        of these two mechanisms they follow.\\nData for these results can be found

        heute, originalgetreue Kopien von Skulpturen,\\nBauwerken oder anderen dreidimensionalen
        Objekten anzufertigen. Dabei\\nentwickelt sich die Technik st\xE4ndig weiter;
        die daf\xFCr notwendigen Daten\\nk\xF6nnen inzwischen auch durch wenige Fotografien
        aus verschiedenen\\nPerspektiven hochgerechnet werden. So faszinierend die
        technische\\nEntwicklung ist, so unklar ist oft, welche rechtlichen Implikationen
        mit\\nsolchen 3D-Scans einhergehen.\\n\\n## 1. 3D-Scans urheberrechtlich gesch\xFCtzter
        Werke {#d-scans-urheberrechtlich-gesch\xFCtzter-werke}\\n\\nDas Urheberrecht
        sch\xFCtzt Werke der Kunst und als solche auch Skulpturen\\nund andere dreidimensionale
        Objekte, sofern diese Ausdruck einer\\npers\xF6nlichen geistigen Sch\xF6pfung
        sind. Dabei w\xE4hrt dieser\\nurheberrechtliche Schutz bis zu dem Jahr, nach
        dem der Urheber 70 Jahre\\nverstorben ist -- erst danach ist ein Werk gemeinfrei.\\nUrheberrechtlicher
        Schutz bewirkt, dass ein Werk nur mit ausdr\xFCcklicher\\nZustimmung des Sch\xF6pfers
        oder seines Rechtsnachfolgers \u201Egenutzt\\\" werden\\nkann. Unter \u201ENutzung\\\"
        im urheberrechtlichen Sinn versteht man\\nbeispielsweise die \u201EVervielf\xE4ltigung\\\",
        also das Kopieren (daher der\\nenglische Begriff \u201Ecopyright\\\"), aber
        auch das Bearbeiten, Ausstellen,\\nVorf\xFChren, Verfilmen usw. Nicht vom
        urheberrechtlichen Schutz umfasst\\nist der blo\xDFe Werkgenuss.\\n\\nScannen
        ganz allgemein wie auch 3D-Scans im Besonderen sind im\\nurheberrechtlichen
        Sinn ein \u201EVervielf\xE4ltigen\\\", also ein Kopieren. Sofern\\ndies nicht
        im rein privaten Rahmen geschieht und diese Kopien\\nver\xF6ffentlicht werden,
        ist dies nur mit Zustimmung des Rechteinhabers\\nerlaubt. Im Rahmen einer
        k\xFCnstlerischen Arbeit, die sich ja an eine\\n\xD6ffentlichkeit wendet,
        bedarf es also grunds\xE4tzlich der Erlaubnis des\\nRechteinhabers des Originalkunstwerks.\\n\\nDie
        Ver\xF6ffentlichung von Bearbeitungen bedarf der Zustimmung des\\nRechteinhabers
        des Ursprungswerks. Doch selbst davon gibt es Ausnahmen.\\nZul\xE4ssig sind
        etwa die Verfremdungen von Werken als Karikatur, Satire\\noder Pastiche. Zul\xE4ssig
        w\xE4re auch, ein neues Werk zu schaffen, das sich\\nvom Original sehr weitgehend
        unterscheidet. Wenn das urspr\xFCngliche Werk\\ninfolge der gravierenden Ver\xE4nderungen
        hinter dem neuen Werk verblasst\\nund kaum noch erkennbar ist, wird dies rechtlich
        nicht als Bearbeitung,\\nsondern als eigenst\xE4ndiges, neues Werk gesehen.
        Diese Ausnahmef\xE4lle\\nsollen hier jedoch nicht weiter ausgef\xFChrt werden.
        Denn das Besondere an\\n3D-Scans ist ja gerade, dass sie das Original m\xF6glichst
        unver\xE4ndert\\nabbilden. Solche originalgetreuen Vervielf\xE4ltigungen bed\xFCrfen
        -- genau\\nwie Bearbeitungen -- der Zustimmung des Rechteinhabers.\\n\\n##
        2. Dreidimensionale Scans von gemeinfreien Werken {#dreidimensionale-scans-von-gemeinfreien-werken}\\n\\nG\xE4nzlich
        anders ist die Situation bei dreidimensionalen Scans von\\ngemeinfreien Werken.\\n\\n###
        Kein urheberrechtlicher Schutz\\n\\n[Gemeinfreie\\nWerke](https://irights.info/artikel/gemeinfreiheit-wie-frei-ist-frei/29619)\\nd\xFCrfen
        frei genutzt werden. Auch das Herstellen von 3D-Scans ist\\nurheberrechtlich
        zul\xE4ssig, wobei ohne Bedeutung ist, welche Technik\\nhierbei genutzt wird.\\n\\n###
        Hausrecht der Institutionen\\n\\nGeht es um das Scannen gemeinfreier Werke,
        so ist dies jedoch auch mit\\nganz praktischen Schwierigkeiten verbunden.
        Um eine Skulptur scannen zu\\nk\xF6nnen, muss man Zugang zu ihr haben. Abh\xE4ngig
        davon, welche Technik\\nverwendet wird, muss entweder ein aufw\xE4ndiger 3D-Scanner
        eingesetzt\\nwerden. Oder aber es m\xFCssen mindestens einige Fotos gemacht
        werden, die\\ndann die Basis f\xFCr eine computergest\xFCtzte Hochrechnung
        des 3D-Modells\\nsind.\\n\\nHier stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit das Hausrecht
        einer Institution,\\nbeispielsweise eines Museums oder eines Archivs, dem
        entgegensteht. Es\\nist zwar anerkannt, dass Fotoverbote in Museen rechtlich
        zul\xE4ssig sind.\\nIn Deutschland hat dies der Bundesgerichtshof damit begr\xFCndet,
        dass\\nsolche Fotoverbote auch andere Zwecke verfolgen k\xF6nnen, als eine\\nVervielf\xE4ltigung
        zu verhindern, beispielsweise restauratorische Zwecke\\noder solche der Besucherf\xFChrung
        und des organisatorischen Ablaufs. In\\nEuropa d\xFCrfen auch \xF6ffentlich
        finanzierte Institutionen das\\nFotografieren verbieten.\\n\\nIn der Praxis
        werden solche Fotoverbote jedoch zunehmend fraglich. Mehr\\nund mehr Kulturerbe-Einrichtungen
        \xFCberall auf der Welt verzichten ganz\\nbewusst auf Fotografierverbote,
        f\xFChlen sich dem Prinzip eines Offenen\\nZugangs verpflichtet und wollen
        auch die freie Nachnutzung von Werken in\\nihrer Obhut erm\xF6glichen. Bahnbrechend
        f\xFCr eine solche Position war das\\nRijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In vielen
        L\xE4ndern ist eine freie Verf\xFCgbarkeit\\nund Nachnutzbarkeit inzwischen
        Bedingung f\xFCr eine \xF6ffentliche F\xF6rderung\\nvon Digitalisierungsprojekten.
        Als typisch f\xFCr diese Entwicklung mag\\nauch die [Open Access Policy der
        Kulturerbe-Einrichtungen des Landes\\nHessens](https://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/es/2021/0029)
        gelten, die sich\\nexplizit gegen Fotografierverbote ausspricht.\\n\\nHinzu
        kommt, dass die\\n[PSI-Richtlinie](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L1024&from=DE)\_auch\\nstaatliche
        oder \xF6ffentlich finanzierte Kulturerbe-Einrichtungen in\\nEuropa verpflichtet,
        die Nutzung ihrer Best\xE4nde zu gestatten. Mittels\\ndes Hausrechts die Nutzung
        von Daten \xFCber gemeinfreie Werke zu\\nverhindern, widerspricht zwar dem
        Geist der PSI-Richtlinie. Ein Recht\\nauf Zugang, insbesondere auf eine spezifische
        Art des Zugangs, kann\\ndaraus aber nicht abgeleitet werden.\\n\\nIn der Praxis
        gibt es zwar immer noch einige Kulturerbe-Einrichtungen,\\ndie versuchen,
        den Zugang auch zu gemeinfreien Best\xE4nden durch Vertr\xE4ge\\nso zu gestalten,
        dass eine Nachnutzung eingeschr\xE4nkt wird. Angesichts\\nder klaren Wertentscheidung
        des europ\xE4ischen Gesetzgebers f\xFCr die\\nGemeinfreiheit ist die rechtliche
        Zul\xE4ssigkeit solcher Bestimmungen aber\\nzweifelhaft. Hier gibt es jedoch
        in Europa Unterschiede in den\\njeweiligen nationalen Gesetzgebungen.\\n\\n###
        Recht aus dem Sacheigentum\\n\\nGrunds\xE4tzlich gilt in Europa, dass aus
        dem Sacheigentum an einem\\nKunstwerk kein Recht an einem Foto oder einer
        der Kopie dieses\\nKunstwerks folgt. Dies ist eine Frage des Urheberrechts,
        nicht des\\nSachenrechts.\\n\\nEntgegen diesem Grundsatz gibt es vereinzelt
        Bestrebungen, dem\\nSacheigent\xFCmer auch die Kontrolle \xFCber Abbildungen
        zuzugestehen. So hat\\nin Deutschland der Bundesgerichtshof dem Eigent\xFCmer
        einer Immobilie das\\nRecht zugesprochen, gegen die Nutzung von Fotos vorzugehen,
        die gegen\\nsein ausdr\xFCckliches Verbot vom Grund und Boden der Immobilie
        aus von\\neinem dort ebenfalls befindlichen Bauwerk gemacht wurden (Schloss\\nSanssouci).
        Aus diesem umstrittenen Urteil l\xE4sst sich jedoch nicht\\nableiten, dass
        die Nutzung von Fotos f\xFCr eine computergest\xFCtzte\\nRekonstruktion eines
        Bauwerks ebenfalls gegen die Rechte des Eigent\xFCmers\\nverst\xF6\xDFt. Dies
        w\xE4re eine \xDCberdehnung der Rechte des Sacheigent\xFCmers, da\\nmit der
        3D-Rekonstruktion eines Geb\xE4udes (oder auch einer Skulptur) auf\\nder Grundlage
        von Fotos keine Beeintr\xE4chtigung des Eigentums selbst\\nverbunden ist und
        auch keine Handlungen erfolgen, die gegen ein\\nausdr\xFCckliches und durch
        den Eigent\xFCmer durchsetzbares Verbot erfolgen.\\n\\n### Nutzung von Fotos
        f\xFCr computergest\xFCtzte Rekonstruktionen\\n\\nSofern gemeinfreie dreidimensionale
        Werke nicht frei zug\xE4nglich sind\\noder Institutionen ihr Hausrecht nutzen,
        um dreidimensionale Scans zu\\nverhindern, so verbleibt gleichwohl die M\xF6glichkeit,
        bereits bestehende\\nFotos zu nutzen, um computergest\xFCtzt die dreidimensionalen
        Objekte\\nhochzurechnen und zu rekonstruieren.\\n\\nIn aller Regel ist die
        Nutzung von Fotos f\xFCr solche computergest\xFCtzten\\nRekonstruktionen zul\xE4ssig.
        Dies gilt zum einen, wenn es sich bei den\\nFotos um reine Lichtbilder und
        nicht um Lichtbildwerke handelt. Die\\nAbgrenzung von Lichtbildern und Lichtbildwerken
        ist kompliziert;\\nvereinfacht gesagt trifft bei einem Lichtbildwerk der Fotograf
        eigene\\ngestalterische Entscheidungen und ist damit sch\xF6pferisch t\xE4tig.
        Bei\\neinem Lichtbild hingegen kommt es zu keiner sch\xF6pferischen Entscheidung.\\nBilder
        von Skulpturen, die nach festen, vorgegebene Parameter gefertigt\\nwerden
        und nur der Dokumentation eines Bestandes dienen, wird man als\\nLichtbilder
        einzuordnen haben, w\xE4hrend Fotografien, in denen ein Objekt\\nin besonderer,
        kreativer Weise durch Licht und Schatten und den\\nAufnahmewinkel inszeniert
        wird, als Werke gelten.\\n\\nReine Lichtbilder gemeinfreier Werke sind urheberrechtlich
        nicht\\ngesch\xFCtzt. Sie d\xFCrfen daher zur computergest\xFCtzten Rekonstruktion\\ngenutzt
        werden. Doch das gilt in aller Regel auch f\xFCr Fotos, die einen\\nWerkcharakter
        und mithin einen urheberrechtlichen Schutz haben. Denn\\nArt. 4 der DSM-Richtlinie
        sieht vor, dass zum Zwecke des \u201EText and Data\\nMining\\\" Vervielf\xE4ltigungen
        auch von urheberrechtlich gesch\xFCtzten Werken\\ngemacht werden d\xFCrfen,
        sofern dies zur automatisierten Analyse der darin\\nenthaltenen Information
        notwendig ist. Die Nutzung auch urheberrechtlich\\ngesch\xFCtzter Werke w\xE4re
        nur dann unzul\xE4ssig, wenn im konkreten Einzelfall\\nin geeigneter Weise
        -- und das hei\xDFt bei der Pr\xE4sentation im Internet in\\nmaschinenlesbarer
        Weise -- der Nutzung durch automatisiert Analyse ganz\\nausdr\xFCcklich widersprochen
        wurde. Dies ist bei Fotos (bisher) nur in\\nAusnahmef\xE4llen so.\\n\\nAllerdings
        ist hier vieles im Fluss. Das Aufkommen von KI-erzeugten\\nBildern hat dazu
        gef\xFChrt, dass die Funktionsweise solcher maschinellen\\nVorg\xE4nge ins
        Blickfeld der \xD6ffentlichkeit ger\xFCckt sind. Denn zumeist\\nnutzen KI-Prozesse
        frei im Netz verf\xFCgbare Bilder als Trainingsdaten.\\nHiergegen gibt es
        zunehmend Vorbehalte von K\xFCnstlern. Um die Nutzung als\\nTrainingsdaten
        zu verhindern, nutzen Sie die Metadaten von Bildern, um\\nin maschinenlesbarer
        Form einer automatisierten Analyse zu\\nwidersprechen. Dies ist jedoch erst
        eine relativ neue Entwicklung und\\nbetrifft vor allem die Abbildungen von
        noch urheberrechtlich gesch\xFCtzten\\nKunstwerken. K\xFCnstler wollen dadurch
        verhindern, dass infolge von\\nKI-Prozessen ihr Stil automatisiert nachempfunden
        wird.\\n\\n## 3. Eigene Rechte am Scans {#eigene-rechte-am-scans}\\n\\nDie
        durch 3D-Scans entstehenden Kopien haben grunds\xE4tzlich keinen\\neigenen
        urheberrechtlichen Schutz.\\n\\n### Keine neuen Rechte an Reproduktionen\\n\\nReproduktionen
        von dreidimensionalen Objekten waren und sind in Europa\\ngrunds\xE4tzlich
        nicht urheberrechtlich gesch\xFCtzt. Dies ist in Hinblick auf\\nden Schutz
        als Werk offensichtlich: Da es sich lediglich um die\\nReproduktion eines
        bereits bestehenden Werkes handelt, ist damit keine\\neigene pers\xF6nliche,
        sch\xF6pferische Leistung verbunden.\\n\\nGleichwohl gab es eine lange rechtliche
        Auseinandersetzung um den\\nrechtlichen Schutz von Reproduktionen gemeinfreier
        Werke. In Italien\\nging es dabei auch um Skulpturen, in Deutschland vorrangig
        um die\\nReproduktionsfotografie. Dort hatte der Bundesgerichtshof nach einem\\nlangen
        Rechtsstreit 2018 schlie\xDFlich entschieden, dass\\nReproduktionsfotografien
        zwar nicht als Werke, wohl aber als blo\xDFe\\n\u201ELichtbilder\\\" gesch\xFCtzt
        waren. Der Lichtbildschutz, den es zwar in\\neinigen, nicht aber in allen
        L\xE4ndern der EU gibt, sch\xFCtzt -- wie bereits\\noben ausgef\xFChrt --
        solche Fotografien, die keine Werke im Sinne einer\\npers\xF6nlichen geistigen
        Sch\xF6pfung sind. Dar\xFCber hinaus k\xF6nnte man auch\\neinen Schutz der
        Daten eines 3D-Scans durch das Datenbankherstellerrecht\\ndenken.\\n\\nDie
        Entwicklungen in verschiedenen europ\xE4ischen L\xE4ndern, Reproduktionen\\ngemeinfreier
        Werke durch verwandte Schutzrechte zu sch\xFCtzen, hat die EU\\nveranlasst,
        im Rahmen der DSM-Richtlinie 2020 klarzustellen, dass bei\\nder [werkgetreuen\\nReproduktion](https://irights.info/artikel/was-wir-kopieren-wenn-wir-kopieren/31674)\\nvon
        gemeinfreien Werke kein neuer Schutz entsteht -- weder durch das\\nUrheberrecht
        noch durch verwandte Schutzrechte. Dies wird durch Art. 14\\nder DSM-Richtlinie
        geregelt. Allerdings gilt dies nicht, sofern das\\ndurch die Vervielf\xE4ltigung
        entstandene Material eine eigene geistige\\nSch\xF6pfung ist.\\n\\n### 3D-Scans
        als eigenes Werk? {#d-scans-als-eigenes-werk}\\n\\nAngesichts dieser Formulierung
        in der DSM-Richtlinie stellt sich die\\nFrage, unter welchen Umst\xE4nden
        3D-Scans als eigene Werke desjenigen\\ngelten, der sie schafft.\\n\\nDer blo\xDFe
        3D-Scan als solcher ist kein eigenes Werk, sondern eine\\nVervielf\xE4ltigung.\\n\\nIm
        Weiteren ist zu unterscheiden. Es ist denkbar, dass die weitere\\nBearbeitung
        eines solchen Scans, oder die Wahl von Materialien und die\\nVer\xE4nderung,
        die daran bei der Ausfertigung vorgenommen werden, selbst\\neinen Werkcharakter
        haben. Denkbar w\xE4re, einer g\xE4nzlich anderen Farb-\\nund Materialgestaltung
        einen Werkcharakter zuzubilligen. Dann bezieht\\nsich dieser urheberrechtliche
        Schutz aber weder auf das Original noch\\nauf den 3D-Scan als solchen, sondern
        nur auf die spezifische\\nAusgestaltung und Kontextualisierung.\\n\\nAber
        selbst wenn man einen Werkcharakter durch die Bearbeitung verneint,\\nja selbst
        wenn auf der Grundlage des 3D-Scans eine absolut\\noriginalgetreue Kopie erstellt
        wird, kann der Pr\xE4sentation und\\nKontextualisierung dieser Kopie ein Werkcharakter
        zukommen. Insofern sei\\nauf das Konzept der \u201EReady-mades\\\" bzw. Objet
        Trouve verwiesen. Danach\\nk\xF6nnen auch Alltags- oder Naturgegenst\xE4nde
        zum Kunstwerk avancieren\\n(also \u201Egemacht\\\" werden), indem der K\xFCnstler
        sie findet und in einen\\nanderen Funktions- und Bedeutungszusammenhang integriert.
        Dies ist auch\\ndurch Scans von gemeinfreien Skulpturen denkbar, die eben
        infolge der\\nnicht nur rechtlich zul\xE4ssigen, sondern auch technisch jederzeit\\nm\xF6glichen
        freien Nachnutzbarkeit in einen neuen Bedeutungszusammenhang\\ngestellt werden
        -- von einem museal ausgestellten und bewunderten Unikat\\nzur jederzeit verf\xFCgbaren
        und nachnutzbaren Alltagsgegenstand.\\n\\n## 4. Fazit {#fazit}\\n\\nDas [Urheberrecht](https://irights.info/kategorie/urheberrecht)
        gilt\\ngemeinhin als Garant daf\xFCr, dass K\xFCnstlern auch eine Grundlage
        f\xFCr die\\nVerwertung ihre Werke gegeben wird. Dies erst schaffe die (materiellen)\\nVoraussetzungen
        f\xFCr k\xFCnstlerische Kreativit\xE4t. Im Bereich der 3D-Scans\\nwird jedoch
        deutlich, dass dies keineswegs eine so zwingende und\\neindeutige Korrelation
        ist, wie oft behauptet wird.\\n\\nDies gilt zum einen, weil das Konzept des
        Urheberrechts,\\nVerbreitungshandlungen (und damit auch die Wirkung) eines
        Werkes zu\\nbeschr\xE4nken, zu kontrollieren und von der Zustimmung des K\xFCnstlers\\nabh\xE4ngig
        zu machen, nicht in jedem Fall im Interesse des K\xFCnstlers (und\\nder Kunst)
        liegt. Dies wird durch den Zuspruch deutlich, den freie\\nLizenzen auch unter
        K\xFCnstlern haben.\\n\\nHinzu kommt, dass das Konzept des urheberrechtlichen
        Werkschutzes dort\\nan seine Grenzen ger\xE4t, wo eine reine Kopie und freie
        Kopierbarkeit\\nkonzeptioneller Ausgangspunkt der Kunst ist. Denn dort besteht
        der\\nk\xFCnstlerische Schaffensakt ja in der Inszenierung und Kontextualisierung\\nund
        auch in der freien Verf\xFCgbarkeit und Nutzbarkeit des Objektes. Und\\ndamit
        ist nicht das Objekt selbst das Werk, sondern seine Inszenierung,\\nNutzung
        und Nutzbarmachung. Von daher ist es auch kein Widerspruch,\\neinem 3D-Scan
        \u201Eals solchem\\\" urheberrechtlichen Schutz abzusprechen und\\ngleichwohl
        die spezifischen Inszenierung, ja sogar das Prinzip der\\nfreien Nachnutzbarkeit
        und Neukontextualisierung als k\xFCnstlerischen\\nAusdruck zu begreifen. Es
        geh\xF6rt zur gro\xDFen und subversiven Kraft der\\nKunst, die Nachnutzbarkeit
        selbst zum konzeptionellen Prinzip zu erheben\\nund damit die traditionelle
        Verhaftung des urheberrechtlichen Schutzes\\nals eines Schutzes des Objektes
        vor der Kopie und Nachnutzbarkeit ad\\nabsurdum zu f\xFChren.\\n\\n### Vom
        Sockel geholt, zur Nachnutzung freigegeben\\n\\nDer 3D-Scan wird so zu einer
        digitalen sozialen Plastik, bei welcher der\\ndurch die freie Nachnutzbarkeit
        vermittelte kommunikative Gehalt\\nintegraler Bestandteil ist.\\n\\nHier zeigt
        sich auch die besondere Kraft des Werkes von Oliver Laric.\\nWurde beim Ready-made
        ein vorbestehender, industrieller Gegenstand zum\\nKunstwerk erkl\xE4rt und
        beispielsweise ein Urinal auf den musealen Sockel\\nerhoben, so geht Laric
        den umgekehrten Weg: Durch die Erstellung von\\n3D-Scans holt er gemeinfreie
        Skulpturen vom Sockel der Museen herunter,\\nbefreit sie und macht sie f\xFCr
        jede Nachnutzung zug\xE4nglich. Und durch\\nseine eigene Nachnutzung kehrt
        diese Kopie des gemeinfreien Werks,\\nangereichert durch die Besonderheiten
        von Larics Adaption und\\nInszenierung, wieder auf den Sockel des Museums
        zur\xFCck. Damit vollendet\\nsich ein Kreislauf von Kreation, freier Verf\xFCgbarkeit,
        Adaption und\\nNeuinterpretation, der die Grenzen urheberrechtlich vermittelter\\nWerkkontrolle
        \xFCberwindet und Raum f\xFCr immer Neues schafft.\\n\\nLaric hebt die vorgefundenen
        Skulpturen durch seine 3D-Scans im\\ndreifachen Sinne Hegels auf: Er \xFCberwindet
        sie, wie man eine alte\\nVorschrift aufhebt, da die Skulpturen aufh\xF6ren,
        museale Unikate zu sein.\\nEr bewahrt sie -- und auch dies ist ja eine Bedeutung
        des Wortes\\n\u201Eaufheben\\\" -- indem er ihre Gestalt vervielf\xE4ltigt,
        vor dem Vergessen\\nbewahrt und neu kontextualisiert. Und letztlich hebt er
        sie dadurch auf\\neine neue Stufe, erhebt sie vom verstaubten musealen Unikat
        zur\\ndigitalen sozialen Plastik.\\n\\n::: {.merksatz}\\n## Sie m\xF6chten

        batch will largely cover computing projects from\\nthe late 1970s into the
        early 1990s. The following batch will largely\\ncover projects from DARPA's
        earlier decades of computing projects. As\\nthe project wears on, I hope to
        cover projects from all eras and general\\nsubject areas of DARPA history.\\n\\nThis
        project will take a deep look at projects that are considered\\nunequivocal
        successes as well as those that are remembered more for\\ntheir lessons learned
        than scientific outputs. The goal of the project\\nis, first and foremost,
        to produce materials that help those who manage\\nresearch funding portfolios
        and labs to do their jobs even better. The\\ntone of the administrative histories

        Identifiers, or \\\"PIDs\\\", have become a popular topic for\\nanyone involved
        in the research communications world. PIDs play a\\ncrucial role in the scholarly
        ecosystem by providing long-lasting\\nreferences to and between all kinds
        of digital resources. PIDs usually\\nconsist of a unique identifier and a
        service that resolves resource\\nreferences over time. While various types
        of PIDs are available, the\\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI) is perhaps the
        most recognized in\\nscholarly communities and has a particular focus on the
        'P':\\nPersistence. As organisations explore the world of PIDs and try to\\nnavigate
        what is increasingly becoming a subjective landscape with\\nunintentional
        obfuscation, it becomes evident that the choice of\\nidentifier infrastructure
        can significantly impact global inclusivity\\nand accessibility, especially
        for lower-income countries.\\n\\nIn this post, we present the facts about
        DataCite and Crossref DOIs and\\ntheir infrastructures, their use, their growth,
        their governance, their\\ntransparency, and their cost---so that organisations
        that care about the\\nrigour of the scholarly record can make more informed
        decisions. By\\ndoing so, we dispel some misconceptions that may risk damaging
        a healthy\\nopen research ecosystem for future generations.\\n\\n## DataCite
        and Crossref DOIs Can Lower Financial Barriers\\n\\nOne of the key advantages
        of DataCite and Crossref DOIs is their\\ncost-effectiveness. Unlike other
        identifier systems that require\\nsubstantial development resources to implement
        and maintain, DOIs offer\\na more budget-friendly alternative. Hidden costs
        associated with\\nimplementing some other PIDs, such as development and maintenance\\nexpenses,
        can often outweigh the perceived upfront savings, posing\\nfinancial barriers
        to their long-term sustainability. These lower costs\\ncan make a significant
        difference for many organizations, particularly\\nthose in lower-income countries.
        It\\\\'s crucial to recognize that\\nDataCite and Crossref DOIs are not merely
        identifiers but valuable\\nmetadata resources for downstream services, fostering
        economies of scale\\nwithin the entire research communications ecosystem.
        This collective and\\nreciprocal network ultimately supports broader dissemination,
        reuse, and\\nrecognition of outputs and resources on a global scale.\\n\\nTogether,
        the nine scholarly-related DOI Registration Agencies have\\nenabled the community
        to create and manage 300 million DOI records.\\nThese DOIs are used approximately
        1.3 billion times every month - and\\ngrowing. With an estimated 8.8 million
        researchers worldwide, that's the\\nequivalent of one article, dataset, preprint,
        report, sample or other\\noutput being read or used 150 times a month. The
        users are not just\\nindividuals but also the systems and tools that are baked
        into research\\nand academia. These open, free-to-use, mineable DOI records
        are\\nincorporated into platforms that span academia, government, and\\nindustry.\\n\\n<figure

        Globally, Acknowledging There Is More To Be Done\\n\\nDataCite is a worldwide
        community with members in 52 countries, as well\\nas over 2,950 repositories
        in many other countries across the globe.\\nIt\\\\'s important to note that
        repositories are not required to be members\\nthemselves; instead, they can
        be affiliated with a DataCite Consortium\\nOrganization or Member. Moreover,
        there are 20 national or regional\\nconsortia operating in emerging regions.
        DataCite\\\\'s open infrastructure\\nservices are a valuable resource for
        repositories in emerging regions,\\nincluding the *National Academic Digital

        has members in 151 countries, creating and stewarding DOI\\nrecords. Crossref's
        research of ISSN data shows that it already includes\\nover 50% of the journals
        produced in the following low-income countries:\\n*Bhutan*, *Central African
        Republic*, *Kyrgyzstan*, *Mali*, *Sudan*, and\\n*Tajikistan*. And it is actively
        working towards filling in the gaps\\nwhere it covers fewer than 49% of the
        journals published in the\\ncountries where research is also increasingly
        produced: *Bangladesh*,\\n*Cote d\\\\'Ivoire*, *Ethiopia*, *Ghana*, *Madagascar*,
        *Nepal*,\\n*Nicaragua*, *Senegal*, and *Tanzania* --- among others.\\n\\nDataCite's
        [GAP Program](https://datacite.org/global-access-program/) is\\nan ongoing
        initiative to improve access and enable communities in\\nlesser-represented
        regions to further benefit from DataCite\\\\'s open\\ninfrastructure services.
        Crossref's [GEM\\nProgram](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) has seen a tripling
        of members\\nin some of the lowest-income countries in the world from 100
        to 305 from\\nJanuary to September 2023. The two organisations, with other
        partners,\\nare working on co-creating a guide to consider how academic and\\ngovernment
        bodies might collaborate at a country level to get involved\\nwith foundational
        global open infrastructures in a sustainable way.\\n\\nOf course, more can
        definitely be done, and practical and informed ideas\\nare always very welcome.\\n\\n##
        DataCite and Crossref DOIs Are Community-Governed Infrastructure\\n\\nResponsible
        open infrastructure organizations do not operate as\\nmonopolies. Instead,
        they emphasize collective community governance and\\nownership. Most DOI Registration
        Agencies (RAs) exemplify this approach;\\nthey are predominantly not-for-profit
        and offer participatory models\\nthat extend beyond membership structures.
        Organizations can join these\\nagencies at no charge, work through consortia
        or sponsors, or opt for\\nannual membership fees, ensuring that financial
        constraints do not\\nhinder accessibility. This community-driven governance
        model safeguards\\nagainst monopolization and ensures that PIDs remain accessible
        to\\ndiverse stakeholders. Further, providing open data and open source code\\nbases
        further safeguards the community investment in open infrastructure\\nservices.\\n\\nBoth
        DataCite and Crossref have tools that allow each member to manage\\ntheir
        resources in the way that they want. Provenance metadata is a high\\npriority
        so that everyone can see who is asserted as the steward of a\\nresearch object,
        whether that\\\\'s changed, who and how much is paid to\\nmaintain the record,
        and any other contributors and acknowledgements.\\n\\nEvery member gets a
        say in the governance, policies, fees, and key\\ndecisions that are made.
        By voting in or standing for board elections,\\njoining fee committees or
        consultations, and approving budgets through\\nopen governance, thousands
        of institutions around the world are\\neffecting change to make the whole
        system properly broadly governed and\\nmore and more inclusive as every month
        and year passes.\\n\\n## DataCite and Crossref DOIs are Persistent and Openly
        Available\\n\\nAnother advantage of Crossref and DataCite DOIs is their persistence.\\nOnce
        registered, the associated metadata is openly available without the\\nneed
        for further financial or resource commitments. For an initial\\none-time registration
        fee, each DOI record is maintained for free -\\nforever. No registration fees
        are levied for the numerous updates and\\nadditional metadata added, which
        will continue to add and enrich the\\nscholarly record for and with future
        generations. This is a crucial\\ndifferentiator compared to some local identifiers,
        which may require\\nongoing investments to maintain accessibility. The stability
        and\\nlongevity of DOIs make them a reliable choice for organizations seeking\\nto
        ensure the enduring accessibility of their digital resources.\\n\\n## DataCite
        and Crossref DOIs come with infrastructure support that isn't free {#datacite-and-crossref-dois-come-with-infrastructure-support-that-isn%E2%80%99t-free}\\n\\nThe
        DOI itself is only one component of our activities; what can be done\\nover
        and above a mere PID tells a very different---and fuller---story. A\\nDOI
        is not just an identifier but a link, a locator, but even then,\\nit\\\\'s
        almost as useless as a URL; the numerous community-led initiatives\\nthat
        have extended and built upon this identifier have real community\\nvalue.
        It\\\\'s the metadata, the relationships, and the connection with\\nother
        parts of the digital infrastructure. These initiatives take time,\\nresources,
        volunteers, tools, consultation, and sometimes funding. Also,\\nexpertise
        and experience. Examples are:\\n\\n- Building an open data citation corpus\\n-
        Co-creating and advising on FAIR projects\\n- Developing infrastructure to
        connect clinical trials to outputs\\n- Urgent flagging of 'free-to-read' COVID
        content\\n- Connecting funding and funders with outputs\\n- Founding and contributing
        to ORCID and ROR and countless other\\n  initiatives\\n- Text-based plagiarism
        checking and other research integrity tools\\n- Ability to track retracted,
        withdrawn, or corrected outputs\\n- Co-developing and supporting open-source
        tool development\\n- Creating a public resource by opening critical data about
        retracted\\n  papers\\n\\nIt's surprising to occasionally hear the argument
        that DOIs should be\\nfree to create when the extensive support systems and
        initiatives\\ndeveloped by Crossref and DataCite are not free to run (nor
        are\\n*distributed* systems, for that matter). The cost of supporting a\\nfunctioning
        global infrastructure should not be underestimated. If the\\ncommunity wants
        a persistent and robust scholarly record, and if it\\nwants a say in its governance,
        then it should be aware of the cost not\\njust of technical things like resolver
        systems, data storage and APIs -\\nbut also of community engagement, collaboration,
        and technical support.\\n\\nIn 2024, Crossref will employ ten full-time staff
        and six contractors on\\nmembership support alone (that's not including proactive
        outreach or\\nengagement activities), plus the cost of the tools and systems
        needed to\\nmanage their 19,000 members and the 3500+ support requests the

        to\\n1 million USD for data costs with physical and cloud storage and\\nprocessing.\\n\\nSimilarly,
        DataCite has three full-time staff dedicated to supporting\\nand partnering
        with emerging regions and three full-time staff members\\nwho support technical
        community support and best practice development.\\nParticular emphasis lies
        in the coordination with more than 50 national\\nor regional consortia to
        cater to their unique needs. With over 2,950\\nrepositories globally and hundreds
        of new repositories joining the\\ncollective community effort each year, our
        efforts are directed towards\\nfostering an open, global, interconnected ecosystem.\\n\\nDataCite
        and Crossref also support and develop other PID services - both\\nORCID iDs
        and ROR IDs have been or are supported operationally,\\nfinancially, or both.
        These evolved from community collaborations and\\ncontinue thriving as essential
        open infrastructures interacting with\\nDOIs.\\n\\nWe know that collectively,
        we benefit from economies of scale and can\\nreduce costs as a community when
        we cooperate globally. It would be far\\nmore costly for the community to
        replicate Crossref and DataCite\\ninfrastructures at the national level, let
        alone at the level of each\\nresearch-performing or research-publishing organisation.\\n\\nWhen
        drawing an analogy to regional electric outlet systems, it becomes\\napparent

        identifiers in research communications,\\nadhering to universal design principles

        is a potential risk of\\nexacerbating fragmentation within the ecosystem,

        Collaboration and Gathering Context\\n\\nIn discussing the merits of various
        identifier systems, gathering\\ninsights and context from stakeholders with
        practical experience in\\nimplementing both is vital. Hypothetical arguments
        should be avoided, as\\nDataCite and Crossref actively collaborate with communities
        to address\\nreal-life challenges by enhancing their services.\\n\\nWe recommend
        that people explore the facts. Ask questions such as \\\"*what\\nis the expected
        resource requirement for us now and in the future?*\\\",\\n\\\"*who is on
        the board?*\\\" and \\\"*how can I get on the board?*\\\", \\\"*how open\\nis
        the metadata, i.e. is it both available and accessible?*\\\". \\\"*What is\\nthe
        likelihood of this going away?*\\\" and \\\"*What safeguards are there for\\nlong-term
        preservation?*\\\". Find out what training and support is\\noffered. Talk
        to your local community that speaks your language, and ask\\nthe members in
        151 countries using DataCite and/or Crossref, e.g., an\\nAmbassador, Consortia
        Lead, or Sponsor.\\n\\nIn conclusion, DOIs through DataCite and Crossref represent
        a\\ncost-effective, community-governed, and persistent solution for\\nidentifying
        and referencing digital resources. By embracing DataCite and\\nCrossref DOIs,
        the global scholarly community is empowered, reducing\\nfinancial barriers
        and fostering broad creation, dissemination, and\\nrecognition of research
        outputs and resources.\\n\\nDataCite and Crossref are actively investing in
        working on community\\ncollaboration, making it essential for stakeholders
        to engage in\\nconstructive dialogues that contribute to the ongoing improvement
        of\\nresearch services. If you tell us more specifics about your needs and\\nexperience,
        we'll tell you more about the reality of running\\ninfrastructure, and we'll
        figure something out to help you get involved.\\nTogether, we can build a

        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> Welcome back to the Open Update.</p><p>We're
        back in the series talking about the decade of open science in the last 10
        years, and then also this week we're gonna be talking a bit about, what do
        we foresee for the next 10 years?</p><p>In the last episode we talked about
        is open science stagnating, how do we look at the developments over the past
        10 years in various areas? Of course, open access, we have very clear numbers
        that it's gotten much, much better. But open science is much more than just
        that. So there's also policy that's in place now that is promising for the
        next 10 years, but we want to take time today to also talk about what is it
        that we receive for the next 10 years? Where are some opportunities, some
        challenges, and what are some of the risks in terms of how we've experienced
        the open research movement in the past 10 years? What are some things to look
        out for?</p><p>[00:00:54] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> Something that
        I'm excited about seeing the development of in the coming years is, is the
        critical branch of meta science where we're not just accepting that these
        forms of openness are beneficial to everyone in every context.</p><p>But considering
        some of the nuanced aspects of that when pre-registration is not valuable
        or beneficial, when registered reports are problematic as a format, when openness
        doesn't always work for the benefit of everyone. So I'm, I'm really interested
        in where those discussions are going to go. That's a branch of meta science
        that I'm starting to see taking shape.</p><p>It's one thing to, to criticize
        other people's research as we have been doing for the last decade with replications,
        with calling people out with retractions. But now we're moving on to, \\\"okay,
        so how does the tenor of that discussion go?\\\" How does that tone, how should
        that tone look? So that's something that I'm excited to see sort of opening
        up in the future.</p><p>[00:01:54] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> \_For
        me personally, one of the things that I did not think would happen, at some
        point you just notice it's the same old discussions all over again. I'm still
        hearing these conversations about the impact factors, even though we knew
        about this eight years ago, just as well. Well, it's maybe a few different
        people having this conversation, so I understand it's also a bit of onboarding
        probably for people entering this space.</p><p>But why is this even still
        important? We're all susceptible to that feeling of we're having conversations
        all over again. That is something I definitely wanna look out for, is to really
        push that conversation forward about what does it mean to improve open research
        and actually making these things happen instead of just talking about them.</p><p>[00:02:38]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I'm really interested in these unintended
        consequences of the science reform movement.</p><p>That's another sort of
        thing that I'm really getting excited about, because often we are really uprooting
        parts of a larger, very complicated moving system, and so understanding, you
        know, what some of the challenges and the, the consequences of that are, that's
        a sort of a branch of, of critical meta science that I think is really great.</p><p>[00:03:02]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> It's very interesting to see that change
        happening because we talked about solutionism and trying to fix problems,
        and I think from that framework, unintended consequences are unforeseen very
        often, and of course unintended consequences are very often things we didn't
        think about, but it's exactly that point where if we stop thinking about fixing
        one problem and then, you know, clearing ourselves and saying, okay, we're
        done here, then those unintended consequences become part of the process.</p><p>It's
        the, \\\"okay, we address one thing and something else pops up.\\\" It's like
        a continuous whack-a-mole of just trying to move forward. So in that sense,
        I think those two things are very tied to each other 'cause only if we really
        have a way to have those conversations in a productive way, to express criticism,
        to express concerns, to express just thoughts around specific ideas, only
        then can we identify where that next step might be taken.</p><p>In those next
        10 years, if we were to do an episode like this or a series of like this,
        again in 10 years, I would be very, very glad if we can look back and identify,
        okay, we've actually made much more decisions, much more statements, much
        more, joint efforts in terms of how resources get spent, how power gets used,
        how we organize things. Because right now we're very often making those decisions
        individually, or we have open letters where we sign on to a statement, which
        is also a form of organizing.</p><p>But on the scale of organizing, I think
        that's an entry point. It's a relatively low hanging fruit instead of, you
        know, completely the opposite. How do we actually organize to complete a project?
        'cause imagine if we were able to do a large scale project with a hundred
        people, you know, replication projects, they've done this. How would we do
        this on a continuous scale to really, you know, mobilize beyond. Just a research
        project. I think that's something that I would be very keen on being able
        to look back on in 10 years.</p><p>[00:05:30] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong>
        \_Just wanted to touch on something you mentioned before about how we can't
        always anticipate the next step because often these consequences are unintended.
        This comes back to sort of something I've been thinking more and more about
        lately is that open is a such an enormous toolbox of practices. When I'm thinking
        about anticipating the, the possible chains of effect of certain actions,
        what comes along with that is also accountability.</p><p>For me, looking forward,
        you know, it, I would like to see people engaging with the challenges of open
        research with this kind of multifaceted approach. Having this anticipation,
        having this accountability alongside the actions that they are taking. I think
        that that rounded approach is, is gonna be beneficial and that's gonna really
        be valuable. That's, that's my perspective.</p><p>You mentioned that part
        of what causes a stagnation, that we're seeing is partly onboarding. So by
        that I'm assuming you mean when new researchers, for example, are, are coming
        on board with, with open research, they're learning the discourse, they're,
        they're learning to contribute their own ideas.</p><p>'cause this is gonna
        be constantly happening. I know people literally every day, every minute are
        coming to open research. How do we allow that onboarding and encourage that
        onboarding? 'cause of course we want this without getting redundancy or getting
        stagnation. Do you have any thoughts on that?</p><p>[00:07:07] <strong>Chris
        Hartgerink:</strong> I always like when people say, let's create onboarding
        ramps, because I think that's a very natural way of thinking about it. You
        can't just immediately hit the highway without an onboarding ramp. Right.
        I didn't necessarily want to criticize that these conversations are being
        had. 'cause I think it's more the, that there's still a need to have these
        conversations.</p><p>So in terms of onboarding, there's \\\"one\\\" too many
        places where there's literally zero onboarding. Here's your key to the office,
        here's your laptop or your computer, your logging info, and you know, figure
        it out on your own. Especially with early career researchers who are entering
        a PhD.</p><p>You might have situations where it's really nice and there's
        actually a group who cares about that, and they also go beyond the onboarding
        they might have, for example, you know, building trust within a team, which
        is incredibly important.</p><p>And then also offboarding to understand where
        our improvement factors for that specific group. Having both the conversations
        at the very beginning, at the very end, but also intermittently in between
        to understand what's happening. And I think there's just too many places within
        research where very normal management practices aren't implemented at all.</p><p>So
        for example, if I were to enter a research group today, I would very much
        like to know, what is the culture? What is the expectation with respect to
        how do we communicate? What is the expectation with respect to how do we work
        within a team?</p><p>You know, when something gets submitted, is it enough
        to have people's implicit approval or explicit approval? And just setting
        up that cultural norm. Then also vice versa. Literally saying, okay, this
        is what we don't do. So if there is a group where you come into and you know,
        journal impact factors are not important at all, but everybody else at the
        department talks about them, then you're gonna be the odd one out and it's
        gonna influence how you see it.</p><p>So I think just in that sense, onboarding
        is incredibly important to not necessarily preempt these conversations, but
        to create clarity. Because I think I've mentioned this in another episode
        like way back, but in ambiguity there resides a lot of power. And I think
        with a lot of research groups, there's just incredible amounts of ambiguity.</p><p>There's
        a meeting and then there's a decision, and I feel like that also creates inconsistencies
        between person 1, 2, 3. In the same research group, and if there's one thing
        about good management is that you apply it the same way to everybody who is
        affected by that, regardless of whether they're an, an incredible say, PhD
        candidate or an average one, or, underperforming one.</p><p>I think in that
        sense, there's just so much we can do to make sure that management. Creates
        good conditions. The compost for these practices to flourish.</p><p>[00:10:16]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> That's what I really like about what FORTT
        are doing. They are basically a landing page for people to go as sort of a
        first step in their open research journey. I love that because it does help
        people, in the sense that it provides a uniform basis for everyone to sort
        of start on. It provides information, templates, that kind of thing. And it
        really does help with onboarding so that people aren't sort of reinventing
        the wheel for themselves. That really helps with, especially with, with ECRs
        who are still finding their footing in research in general.</p><p>Learning,
        you know, to conduct research. And then on top of that, this extra level of
        methodology and, and philosophy to sort of also learn that alongside.</p><p>[00:11:00]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> FORTT is doing tremendous work. Just the
        size of that community and how fast they've grown in a decentralized system.
        Flip side of FORTT, but also a lot of other onboarding or in general academic
        approaches to communicating is, it tends to be incredibly precise. And incredibly
        lengthy and incredibly difficult to understand.</p><p>It's not an onboarding
        language very often, so I think that there's still room for improvement in
        terms of how do we write, with what clarity do we enter that situation and
        with the purpose to communicate something effectively in different forms,
        but also in a succinct way.</p><p>I often stumble upon resources that are
        pages and pages and pages long, which creates a lot of attrition, which creates
        a lot of, lack of retaining, even though maybe if you can summarize it in,
        say, a few paragraphs that are very well copywritten, that aren't perfect.
        If retaining the information is higher, I think that trade off is worth it.</p><p>So
        this aspect of getting out of our academic mindset sometimes is very difficult.
        But it's important because I see that there we could really, really gain a
        lot of ground. But that is my personal opinion on that front because I only
        started noticing how much that influenced how I personally wrote after I stopped
        needing to do it. Because clear communication really removes the need for
        so much extra work and clear communication is incredibly difficult. Let's
        be, let's be honest.</p><p>[00:12:49] <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> I
        mean, when you come into the open space, there is so much to learn.</p><p>So
        say you wanna conduct a replication, you know, there are lots of different
        templates for how to conduct that. There are a lot of different ideas on how
        you might wanna go about choosing a study for replication. There are different
        ways to pre-register your plans for a, a replication, for example.</p><p>Having
        piles and piles of resources to go through is a huge amount of labor. But
        I think it's, it's difficult because there is so much information to be consumed,
        but that's why I really like Christina Bergman's buffet approach to open research.
        For the listeners who aren't familiar with that, it's this idea that when
        you approach open research, you pick and choose the approaches or the resources
        or the tools you use, which fit best into your way of doing research. Into
        your particular research paradigm, into your particular epistemology.</p><p>And
        I think that's really important to help educate people on that way of thinking
        about open research. It's not about you have to adopt all of the things, do
        all the stuff or you're not an open researcher. It applies to you in whatever
        phase you're at, in whatever way you do research. It's a matter of helping,
        you know, guide people to what's most useful for them and how they can contribute
        to the open movement, if you can call it.</p><p>[00:14:12] <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong>
        Yeah. And in that sense, also, what, what helps reduce the complexity is clear
        language, of course. But there's also a, you know, recognizing indeed that
        you don't have to eat everything from the buffet. You don't need to finish
        all the plates. Um, and there's something for everyone. At the same time also
        reducing all of this complexity to fundamental principles.</p><p>I think we
        too often get sucked into talking about reproducibility, replicability, open
        access, APCs, all of these specific things, when in essence all of it can
        be really drilled down to working openly. And that doesn't mean everything
        needs to be open, but this idea of can others access your results or whatever
        it is that you're doing, and understanding where in that process it might
        not be possible.</p><p>And just reflecting on that and saying, okay, what
        could I do to improve that bit? For me, that that has been really the, the
        red line throughout my own work. It's the. I'm reviewing something. Can I
        understand what they, what they did in the paper, where those results came
        from? Oh, I'm submitting something. Oh, you know, can people actually access
        the data? I might have a link in there, but let's double check. And so all
        of these things about working openly, it's also this question of just simply
        what is the, what is the narrative around your own work, and is that publicly
        available?</p><p>Sometimes you can actually decide. I don't want this to be
        available, but to me that has really been the core of my own philosophy. And
        then it's no longer about applying that in research, but it, it could be applied
        anywhere. Whether, whether I, you know, if I go to software engineering, of
        course we have open source, but that same principle applies if we go to finances.
        You could ask the same question. If you go to legal scholarship, you could
        ask that question as well. Of course, it gets different answers. But in that
        sense, reducing that complexity is, I hope that that happens in the next 10
        years and that, uh, that that helps make it easier to navigate and that people
        also get the encouragement to discover what that means for them, because in
        that sense, Anybody's working process, regardless of whether it's open or
        closed or anything in between is very personal and changes all the time.</p><p>[00:16:49]
        <strong>Sarahanne Field:</strong> What I like about some of the maturity of,
        of the movement that we're we're coming into, is that we are interrogating
        that assumption of open always being best. Where some of us at least are getting
        the confidence to sort of decipher ourselves rather than just drinking the
        open Kool-Aid. We're starting to think about this more actively engaging with
        that question of \\\"when is open most beneficial and is, is it always beneficial
        and for every case?\\\"</p><p>That's something that I try and instill in,
        in people who come to me for, for advice, students I have, for example. I
        try and just instill a sense of confidence in them and give them the idea
        that they should be conducting research in the spirit of openness.</p><p>So
        they may not have all the skills and the knowledge to engage in all the practices
        they want to. But I think what has to come first is acting in that spirit
        of honesty and transparency and integrity. That's a really important place
        to start and have confidence in acting in that way, and in, in my opinion,
        so much falls into place after that.</p><p>Then you can learn, for example,
        as just an undergraduate student to write your research reports with transparency,
        be aware of things like supplemental material and that they can be published
        alongside the paper. Encouraging detail when it comes to methodological reporting,
        for example, and giving them confidence that they can just start at that level.</p><p>So
        I think that's something that I really like, is that we're just starting to
        sort of see how we can act in the spirit of openness and not always have to
        be doing all the things. That's sort of a natural progression from Bergman's
        idea of, of the open buffet is just starting off, you know, as you're onboarding
        in general or as an ECR coming into open research, that you begin with acting
        in the spirit of that.</p><p>It takes time, right? To build the skill to perform
        these practices properly. It's difficult to get all of the steps right. And
        there is a fear in a lot of, especially ECRs, that if they do it wrong, the
        open science bullies are gonna come for them. People have said this to me
        that they're afraid of that. So I think instilling that sense of confidence
        and, and getting them to, to learn to think in the spirit of openness is a
        great place to start.</p><p>So, confidence building. Capacity building. Giving
        them the, the self-efficacy and the confidence to, to think I can build these
        skills up. I have the space and the time to learn these things, rather than
        saying, yeah, all the practices have to happen like that, you know?</p><p>That
        brings me to a, a new thread of conversation we might want to follow in the
        next episode, which is the question of how the burden of responsible conduct,
        open practices, who that burden should fall on, and how should we distribute
        that burden or that responsibility across the members in a team.</p><p>[00:19:37]
        <strong>Chris Hartgerink:</strong> So join us again in a few weeks and we'll

        to join our signal group. If you have ideas around how research or open research
        or just research in general should develop in the next 10 years, what you
        would like to see. I think we've had some very concrete points, more confidence
        building, more clarity and communication and reducing the complexity.</p><p>And
        so we would love to hear from you as well.</p><p>[00:20:05] <strong>Sarahanne

        **Chris Hartgerink:** Welcome back to the Open Update.\\n\\nWe\\\\'re back
        in the series talking about the decade of open science in\\nthe last 10 years,
        and then also this week we\\\\'re gonna be talking a bit\\nabout, what do

        is open science stagnating, how do\\nwe look at the developments over the

        numbers that it\\\\'s gotten much,\\nmuch better. But open science is much
        more than just that. So there\\\\'s\\nalso policy that\\\\'s in place now
        that is promising for the next 10\\nyears, but we want to take time today
        to also talk about what is it that\\nwe receive for the next 10 years? Where
        are some opportunities, some\\nchallenges, and what are some of the risks

        **Sarahanne Field:** Something that I\\\\'m excited about\\nseeing the development
        of in the coming years is, is the critical branch\\nof meta science where
        we\\\\'re not just accepting that these forms of\\nopenness are beneficial
        to everyone in every context.\\n\\nBut considering some of the nuanced aspects
        of that when\\npre-registration is not valuable or beneficial, when registered
        reports\\nare problematic as a format, when openness doesn\\\\'t always work
        for the\\nbenefit of everyone. So I\\\\'m, I\\\\'m really interested in where
        those\\ndiscussions are going to go. That\\\\'s a branch of meta science that
        I\\\\'m\\nstarting to see taking shape.\\n\\nIt\\\\'s one thing to, to criticize
        other people\\\\'s research as we have\\nbeen doing for the last decade with
        replications, with calling people\\nout with retractions. But now we\\\\'re
        moving on to, \\\\\\\"okay, so how does\\nthe tenor of that discussion go?\\\\\\\"
        How does that tone, how should that\\ntone look? So that\\\\'s something that
        I\\\\'m excited to see sort of opening\\nup in the future.\\n\\n\\\\[00:01:54\\\\]
        **Chris Hartgerink:** \_For me personally, one of the things\\nthat I did
        not think would happen, at some point you just notice it\\\\'s\\nthe same
        old discussions all over again. I\\\\'m still hearing these\\nconversations
        about the impact factors, even though we knew about this\\neight years ago,
        just as well. Well, it\\\\'s maybe a few different people\\nhaving this conversation,
        so I understand it\\\\'s also a bit of onboarding\\nprobably for people entering
        this space.\\n\\nBut why is this even still important? We\\\\'re all susceptible
        to that\\nfeeling of we\\\\'re having conversations all over again. That is
        something\\nI definitely wanna look out for, is to really push that conversation\\nforward
        about what does it mean to improve open research and actually\\nmaking these
        things happen instead of just talking about them.\\n\\n\\\\[00:02:38\\\\]
        **Sarahanne Field:** I\\\\'m really interested in these\\nunintended consequences
        of the science reform movement.\\n\\nThat\\\\'s another sort of thing that
        I\\\\'m really getting excited about,\\nbecause often we are really uprooting
        parts of a larger, very\\ncomplicated moving system, and so understanding,
        you know, what some of\\nthe challenges and the, the consequences of that
        are, that\\\\'s a sort of\\na branch of, of critical meta science that I think
        is really great.\\n\\n\\\\[00:03:02\\\\] **Chris Hartgerink:** It\\\\'s very
        interesting to see that\\nchange happening because we talked about solutionism
        and trying to fix\\nproblems, and I think from that framework, unintended
        consequences are\\nunforeseen very often, and of course unintended consequences
        are very\\noften things we didn\\\\'t think about, but it\\\\'s exactly that
        point where\\nif we stop thinking about fixing one problem and then, you know,\\nclearing
        ourselves and saying, okay, we\\\\'re done here, then those\\nunintended consequences
        become part of the process.\\n\\nIt\\\\'s the, \\\\\\\"okay, we address one
        thing and something else pops up.\\\\\\\"\\nIt\\\\'s like a continuous whack-a-mole
        of just trying to move forward. So\\nin that sense, I think those two things
        are very tied to each other\\n\\\\'cause only if we really have a way to have
        those conversations in a\\nproductive way, to express criticism, to express
        concerns, to express\\njust thoughts around specific ideas, only then can
        we identify where\\nthat next step might be taken.\\n\\nIn those next 10 years,
        if we were to do an episode like this or a\\nseries of like this, again in
        10 years, I would be very, very glad if we\\ncan look back and identify, okay,
        we\\\\'ve actually made much more\\ndecisions, much more statements, much
        more, joint efforts in terms of\\nhow resources get spent, how power gets
        used, how we organize things.\\nBecause right now we\\\\'re very often making
        those decisions individually,\\nor we have open letters where we sign on to
        a statement, which is also a\\nform of organizing.\\n\\nBut on the scale of
        organizing, I think that\\\\'s an entry point. It\\\\'s a\\nrelatively low
        hanging fruit instead of, you know, completely the\\nopposite. How do we actually
        organize to complete a project? \\\\'cause\\nimagine if we were able to do
        a large scale project with a hundred\\npeople, you know, replication projects,
        they\\\\'ve done this. How would we\\ndo this on a continuous scale to really,
        you know, mobilize beyond. Just\\na research project. I think that\\\\'s something
        that I would be very keen\\non being able to look back on in 10 years.\\n\\n\\\\[00:05:30\\\\]
        **Sarahanne Field:** \_Just wanted to touch on something you\\nmentioned before
        about how we can\\\\'t always anticipate the next step\\nbecause often these
        consequences are unintended. This comes back to sort\\nof something I\\\\'ve
        been thinking more and more about lately is that open\\nis a such an enormous
        toolbox of practices. When I\\\\'m thinking about\\nanticipating the, the
        possible chains of effect of certain actions, what\\ncomes along with that
        is also accountability.\\n\\nFor me, looking forward, you know, it, I would
        like to see people\\nengaging with the challenges of open research with this
        kind of\\nmultifaceted approach. Having this anticipation, having this\\naccountability
        alongside the actions that they are taking. I think that\\nthat rounded approach
        is, is gonna be beneficial and that\\\\'s gonna\\nreally be valuable. That\\\\'s,
        that\\\\'s my perspective.\\n\\nYou mentioned that part of what causes a stagnation,
        that we\\\\'re seeing\\nis partly onboarding. So by that I\\\\'m assuming
        you mean when new\\nresearchers, for example, are, are coming on board with,
        with open\\nresearch, they\\\\'re learning the discourse, they\\\\'re, they\\\\'re
        learning\\nto contribute their own ideas.\\n\\n\\\\'cause this is gonna be
        constantly happening. I know people literally\\nevery day, every minute are
        coming to open research. How do we allow\\nthat onboarding and encourage that
        onboarding? \\\\'cause of course we want\\nthis without getting redundancy
        or getting stagnation. Do you have any\\nthoughts on that?\\n\\n\\\\[00:07:07\\\\]
        **Chris Hartgerink:** I always like when people say, let\\\\'s\\ncreate onboarding
        ramps, because I think that\\\\'s a very natural way of\\nthinking about it.
        You can\\\\'t just immediately hit the highway without\\nan onboarding ramp.
        Right. I didn\\\\'t necessarily want to criticize that\\nthese conversations
        are being had. \\\\'cause I think it\\\\'s more the, that\\nthere\\\\'s still
        a need to have these conversations.\\n\\nSo in terms of onboarding, there\\\\'s
        \\\\\\\"one\\\\\\\" too many places where\\nthere\\\\'s literally zero onboarding.
        Here\\\\'s your key to the office,\\nhere\\\\'s your laptop or your computer,
        your logging info, and you know,\\nfigure it out on your own. Especially with
        early career researchers who\\nare entering a PhD.\\n\\nYou might have situations
        where it\\\\'s really nice and there\\\\'s actually\\na group who cares about
        that, and they also go beyond the onboarding\\nthey might have, for example,
        you know, building trust within a team,\\nwhich is incredibly important.\\n\\nAnd
        then also offboarding to understand where our improvement factors\\nfor that
        specific group. Having both the conversations at the very\\nbeginning, at
        the very end, but also intermittently in between to\\nunderstand what\\\\'s
        happening. And I think there\\\\'s just too many places\\nwithin research
        where very normal management practices aren\\\\'t\\nimplemented at all.\\n\\nSo
        for example, if I were to enter a research group today, I would very\\nmuch
        like to know, what is the culture? What is the expectation with\\nrespect
        to how do we communicate? What is the expectation with respect\\nto how do
        we work within a team?\\n\\nYou know, when something gets submitted, is it
        enough to have people\\\\'s\\nimplicit approval or explicit approval? And
        just setting up that\\ncultural norm. Then also vice versa. Literally saying,
        okay, this is\\nwhat we don\\\\'t do. So if there is a group where you come
        into and you\\nknow, journal impact factors are not important at all, but
        everybody\\nelse at the department talks about them, then you\\\\'re gonna
        be the odd\\none out and it\\\\'s gonna influence how you see it.\\n\\nSo
        I think just in that sense, onboarding is incredibly important to not\\nnecessarily
        preempt these conversations, but to create clarity. Because\\nI think I\\\\'ve
        mentioned this in another episode like way back, but in\\nambiguity there
        resides a lot of power. And I think with a lot of\\nresearch groups, there\\\\'s
        just incredible amounts of ambiguity.\\n\\nThere\\\\'s a meeting and then
        there\\\\'s a decision, and I feel like that\\nalso creates inconsistencies
        between person 1, 2, 3. In the same\\nresearch group, and if there\\\\'s one
        thing about good management is that\\nyou apply it the same way to everybody
        who is affected by that,\\nregardless of whether they\\\\'re an, an incredible
        say, PhD candidate or\\nan average one, or, underperforming one.\\n\\nI think
        in that sense, there\\\\'s just so much we can do to make sure that\\nmanagement.
        Creates good conditions. The compost for these practices to\\nflourish.\\n\\n\\\\[00:10:16\\\\]
        **Sarahanne Field:** That\\\\'s what I really like about what\\nFORTT are
        doing. They are basically a landing page for people to go as\\nsort of a first
        step in their open research journey. I love that because\\nit does help people,
        in the sense that it provides a uniform basis for\\neveryone to sort of start
        on. It provides information, templates, that\\nkind of thing. And it really
        does help with onboarding so that people\\naren\\\\'t sort of reinventing
        the wheel for themselves. That really helps\\nwith, especially with, with
        ECRs who are still finding their footing in\\nresearch in general.\\n\\nLearning,
        you know, to conduct research. And then on top of that, this\\nextra level
        of methodology and, and philosophy to sort of also learn\\nthat alongside.\\n\\n\\\\[00:11:00\\\\]
        **Chris Hartgerink:** FORTT is doing tremendous work. Just\\nthe size of that
        community and how fast they\\\\'ve grown in a\\ndecentralized system. Flip
        side of FORTT, but also a lot of other\\nonboarding or in general academic
        approaches to communicating is, it\\ntends to be incredibly precise. And incredibly
        lengthy and incredibly\\ndifficult to understand.\\n\\nIt\\\\'s not an onboarding
        language very often, so I think that there\\\\'s\\nstill room for improvement
        in terms of how do we write, with what\\nclarity do we enter that situation
        and with the purpose to communicate\\nsomething effectively in different forms,
        but also in a succinct way.\\n\\nI often stumble upon resources that are pages
        and pages and pages long,\\nwhich creates a lot of attrition, which creates
        a lot of, lack of\\nretaining, even though maybe if you can summarize it in,
        say, a few\\nparagraphs that are very well copywritten, that aren\\\\'t perfect.
        If\\nretaining the information is higher, I think that trade off is worth
        it.\\n\\nSo this aspect of getting out of our academic mindset sometimes is
        very\\ndifficult. But it\\\\'s important because I see that there we could
        really,\\nreally gain a lot of ground. But that is my personal opinion on
        that\\nfront because I only started noticing how much that influenced how
        I\\npersonally wrote after I stopped needing to do it. Because clear\\ncommunication
        really removes the need for so much extra work and clear\\ncommunication is
        incredibly difficult. Let\\\\'s be, let\\\\'s be honest.\\n\\n\\\\[00:12:49\\\\]
        **Sarahanne Field:** I mean, when you come into the open\\nspace, there is
        so much to learn.\\n\\nSo say you wanna conduct a replication, you know, there
        are lots of\\ndifferent templates for how to conduct that. There are a lot
        of\\ndifferent ideas on how you might wanna go about choosing a study for\\nreplication.
        There are different ways to pre-register your plans for a,\\na replication,
        for example.\\n\\nHaving piles and piles of resources to go through is a huge
        amount of\\nlabor. But I think it\\\\'s, it\\\\'s difficult because there
        is so much\\ninformation to be consumed, but that\\\\'s why I really like
        Christina\\nBergman\\\\'s buffet approach to open research. For the listeners
        who\\naren\\\\'t familiar with that, it\\\\'s this idea that when you approach
        open\\nresearch, you pick and choose the approaches or the resources or the\\ntools
        you use, which fit best into your way of doing research. Into your\\nparticular
        research paradigm, into your particular epistemology.\\n\\nAnd I think that\\\\'s
        really important to help educate people on that way\\nof thinking about open
        research. It\\\\'s not about you have to adopt all\\nof the things, do all
        the stuff or you\\\\'re not an open researcher. It\\napplies to you in whatever
        phase you\\\\'re at, in whatever way you do\\nresearch. It\\\\'s a matter
        of helping, you know, guide people to what\\\\'s\\nmost useful for them and
        how they can contribute to the open movement,\\nif you can call it.\\n\\n\\\\[00:14:12\\\\]
        **Chris Hartgerink:** Yeah. And in that sense, also, what,\\nwhat helps reduce
        the complexity is clear language, of course. But\\nthere\\\\'s also a, you
        know, recognizing indeed that you don\\\\'t have to\\neat everything from
        the buffet. You don\\\\'t need to finish all the\\nplates. Um, and there\\\\'s
        something for everyone. At the same time also\\nreducing all of this complexity
        to fundamental principles.\\n\\nI think we too often get sucked into talking
        about reproducibility,\\nreplicability, open access, APCs, all of these specific
        things, when in\\nessence all of it can be really drilled down to working
        openly. And that\\ndoesn\\\\'t mean everything needs to be open, but this
        idea of can others\\naccess your results or whatever it is that you\\\\'re
        doing, and\\nunderstanding where in that process it might not be possible.\\n\\nAnd
        just reflecting on that and saying, okay, what could I do to improve\\nthat
        bit? For me, that that has been really the, the red line throughout\\nmy own
        work. It\\\\'s the. I\\\\'m reviewing something. Can I understand what\\nthey,
        what they did in the paper, where those results came from? Oh,\\nI\\\\'m submitting
        something. Oh, you know, can people actually access the\\ndata? I might have
        a link in there, but let\\\\'s double check. And so all\\nof these things
        about working openly, it\\\\'s also this question of just\\nsimply what is
        the, what is the narrative around your own work, and is\\nthat publicly available?\\n\\nSometimes
        you can actually decide. I don\\\\'t want this to be available,\\nbut to me
        that has really been the core of my own philosophy. And then\\nit\\\\'s no
        longer about applying that in research, but it, it could be\\napplied anywhere.
        Whether, whether I, you know, if I go to software\\nengineering, of course
        we have open source, but that same principle\\napplies if we go to finances.
        You could ask the same question. If you go\\nto legal scholarship, you could
        ask that question as well. Of course, it\\ngets different answers. But in
        that sense, reducing that complexity is,\\nI hope that that happens in the
        next 10 years and that, uh, that that\\nhelps make it easier to navigate and
        that people also get the\\nencouragement to discover what that means for them,
        because in that\\nsense, Anybody\\\\'s working process, regardless of whether
        it\\\\'s open or\\nclosed or anything in between is very personal and changes
        all the time.\\n\\n\\\\[00:16:49\\\\] **Sarahanne Field:** What I like about
        some of the maturity\\nof, of the movement that we\\\\'re we\\\\'re coming
        into, is that we are\\ninterrogating that assumption of open always being
        best. Where some of\\nus at least are getting the confidence to sort of decipher
        ourselves\\nrather than just drinking the open Kool-Aid. We\\\\'re starting
        to think\\nabout this more actively engaging with that question of \\\\\\\"when
        is open\\nmost beneficial and is, is it always beneficial and for every case?\\\\\\\"\\n\\nThat\\\\'s
        something that I try and instill in, in people who come to me\\nfor, for advice,
        students I have, for example. I try and just instill a\\nsense of confidence
        in them and give them the idea that they should be\\nconducting research in
        the spirit of openness.\\n\\nSo they may not have all the skills and the knowledge
        to engage in all\\nthe practices they want to. But I think what has to come
        first is acting\\nin that spirit of honesty and transparency and integrity.
        That\\\\'s a\\nreally important place to start and have confidence in acting
        in that\\nway, and in, in my opinion, so much falls into place after that.\\n\\nThen
        you can learn, for example, as just an undergraduate student to\\nwrite your
        research reports with transparency, be aware of things like\\nsupplemental
        material and that they can be published alongside the\\npaper. Encouraging
        detail when it comes to methodological reporting, for\\nexample, and giving
        them confidence that they can just start at that\\nlevel.\\n\\nSo I think
        that\\\\'s something that I really like, is that we\\\\'re just\\nstarting
        to sort of see how we can act in the spirit of openness and not\\nalways have
        to be doing all the things. That\\\\'s sort of a natural\\nprogression from
        Bergman\\\\'s idea of, of the open buffet is just starting\\noff, you know,
        as you\\\\'re onboarding in general or as an ECR coming into\\nopen research,
        that you begin with acting in the spirit of that.\\n\\nIt takes time, right?
        To build the skill to perform these practices\\nproperly. It\\\\'s difficult
        to get all of the steps right. And there is a\\nfear in a lot of, especially
        ECRs, that if they do it wrong, the open\\nscience bullies are gonna come
        for them. People have said this to me\\nthat they\\\\'re afraid of that. So
        I think instilling that sense of\\nconfidence and, and getting them to, to
        learn to think in the spirit of\\nopenness is a great place to start.\\n\\nSo,
        confidence building. Capacity building. Giving them the, the\\nself-efficacy
        and the confidence to, to think I can build these skills\\nup. I have the
        space and the time to learn these things, rather than\\nsaying, yeah, all
        the practices have to happen like that, you know?\\n\\nThat brings me to a,
        a new thread of conversation we might want to\\nfollow in the next episode,
        which is the question of how the burden of\\nresponsible conduct, open practices,
        who that burden should fall on, and\\nhow should we distribute that burden
        or that responsibility across the\\nmembers in a team.\\n\\n\\\\[00:19:37\\\\]

        about this.\\n\\nThank you again for listening. Don\\\\'t forget to join our

        class=\\\"has-drop-cap\\\">The words and concepts we use to describe a particular
        war speak volumes about who we are as individuals and as a community, and
        where we stand in an unfolding conflict. Concepts have always been used to
        occupy the moral high ground. Rebellion, for example, is used to delegitimise
        those who rebel. In Rome, the allied communities were not legally Roman citizens
        and therefore their rebellion was not a \u2018civil war\u2019. However, these
        non-citizens were considered part of the same polity as Roman citizens; the
        idea of an internal war was born, in debates in the Senate and beyond, debates
        between friends and foes. We debate! And sometimes we use violence, or even
        go to war against each other. It happens now, and it has happened many times
        in the past. The writings of contemporaries (and later sources) reflect these
        debates. From the outbreak of the Second Punic War in 218 to the Social War
        in 91, the Romans of the long second century had protracted debates about
        the changing nature of warfare \u2013 including the rebellion of their allies
        in the midst of the Second Punic War \u2013 conceptual and otherwise \u2013
        culminating in Rome\u2019s first civil war in 88 BCE.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At
        its core, my forthcoming book, <em>From Hannibal to Sulla: The Birth of Civil
        War in Republican Rome</em> (<em>Studies in Ancient Civil War</em>, De Gruyter),
        attempts to trace these debates and to show how, over the course of the second
        century, the language of external war was slowly adapted to a new language
        of internal and, ultimately, civil war. It combines two ideas: 1) the formative
        role of antebellum on the one hand, and 2) the importance of the \u2018great\u2019
        war before the civil war on the other hand; in preparing for the next conflict,
        Rome looked back at the last great one. It suggests that the period from the
        Second Punic War constituted, conceptually speaking, an \u2018antebellum\u2019
        period to Rome\u2019s later civil wars. It traces the origins not only of
        the concept and terminology of the <em>bellum civile</em>, but also of related
        terms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-full\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/isbn/9783111335216/html\\\"><img

        the book does not really propose a \u2018conceptual history\u2019 (<em>Begriffsgeschichte</em>)
        in the manner of Reinhart Koselleck. The basic idea that, at some point in
        modernity, old words have acquired new meanings so that they no longer need
        to be translated seems overly simplistic, partly because it gives undue weight
        to modernity (it is close(r) to our contemporary world = it is modern = it
        is different from the non-modern world, or so the argument often seems to
        go. I work mostly on old stuff (= a long time ago), but it is just not pre-modern,
        it is very modern, conceptually speaking certainly so). It is true that some
        concepts recur throughout history, but even so we must accept, with Quentin
        Skinner, that they were never immutable and never had a (pre-)determined meaning.
        We can accept that the phenomenon of civil war recurs (with Thucydides\u2019
        description of the <em>stasis</em> in Corcyra during the Peloponnesian War,
        3.81-85) in the understanding that civil wars occur throughout history: Corcyra,
        the late Roman Republic, the late Roman Empire, the English Civil War, the
        American Civil War, and so on. More than anything, my book is about the history
        of the use of concepts rather than a history of concepts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What
        is more, however coherent definitions may be in theory, in practice they were
        as contestable in ancient times as they are today. Can we still believe \u2013
        in the spirit of positivism \u2013 that deciphering the examples from our
        evidence will provide us with a correct basic definition of the concepts we
        are considering? Hardly! We should never accept that civil war is a concept
        that everyone agreed on in ancient times. Language has an unfortunate tendency
        to obscure the extent to which sources disagree, both in ancient times and
        today. Is <em>stasis</em> the same as civil war? <em>Stasis</em> can be a
        <em>polemos</em>, a (civil) war, but it can also be a sedition. The ancients
        simply never agreed on a definition of such slippery concepts as <em>stasis</em>
        and civil war. Why would they? Why would we? Concepts naturally change over
        time as they are used in a particular context.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 43 BCE
        the warmonger Cicero was trying hard to get the proconsul M. Antonius (<em>cos</em>.
        44) declared a <em>hostis publicus</em>. He was strenuously opposed in this
        endeavour by L. Iulius Caesar (<em>cos</em>. 64), who insisted that the term
        <em>bellum</em> be replaced with <em>tumultus</em> (<em>Phil</em>. 12.17):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure
        class=\\\"wp-block-pullquote\\\"><blockquote><p>I consistently called Antonius
        a public enemy [<em>hostis</em>], while others [L. Iulius Caesar] called him
        an adversary [<em>adversarius</em>]; I consistently called this a war [<em>bellum</em>],
        while others called it a public emergency [<em>tumultus</em>].</p><cite>Cic.
        <em>Phil</em>. 12.17</cite></blockquote></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There has
        never been, and never will be, a single narrative. Reading, for example, David
        Armitage\u2019s fine 2017 book <em>Civil Wars. A History In Ideas</em>, it
        quickly becomes clear that the concept of civil war has always been, as I
        said, a slippery one. Importantly, I firmly believe that scholars should ultimately
        accept that we can safely assume that some features of ancient civil wars
        are indeed regular features of any civil war, and that we should therefore
        accept the civil war in ancient Rome as a valid and instructive example to
        consider in modern debates about civil war. This should come as no surprise!
        And it works just fine without history repeating itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Accordingly,
        all scholars working on civil war\u2014including social and political scientists\u2014need
        to learn their history as well as the traditions of the concepts they apply.
        After all, history is the only laboratory we have. The next question must
        be about the consequences of such an approach.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the book
        I write:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Through
        careful historicization, it is possible to highlight the ahistorical nature
        of modern definitions of civil war. All modern debates about civil war should
        ideally take the Late Republic as their conceptual point of departure: its
        genesis after lies there (a \u201Cwar\u201D between \u201Ccitizens\u201D).
        Alternatively, the concept needs to be abandoned by moderns altogether and
        the concept of \u201Cinternal war\u201D used instead (as famously proposed
        by Eckstein in 1965 [<em>On the Etiology of Internal Wars</em>]). The problem
        with this alternative new concept of \u201Cinternal war\u201D is that this,
        too, was already theorised by the Romans in Latin and is not new at all: <em>bellum
        intestinum</em>, mainly but not exclusively a concept used in connection with
        wars between Rome and its allies or within the polity of allies. The semantic
        range of civil wars is today being stretched to encompass ideological differences
        within for example political parties, so that there is a risk of it losing
        any conceptual specificity</p>\\n<cite>Lange, <em><em>From Hannibal to Sulla:
        The Birth of Civil War in Republican Rome</em></em> (forthcoming)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        problem today is that the concept of civil war is too often stripped of its
        basic meaning (citizenship and war). Not surprisingly, this is further complicated
        by issues such as the definition of war. When is a war a war? It is safe to
        say that a true civil war requires at least something resembling armies and
        battles, with actual fighting between citizens. In his famous book <em>The
        Logic of Violence in Civil War</em>, Stathis Kalyvas gives us a definition:
        \u201Carmed combat within the borders of a recognised sovereign entity between
        parties subject to a common authority at the beginning of hostilities\u201D
        (2006, 17). His definition not only lacks references to and understanding
        of both <em>war</em> and <em>citizenship</em> (<em>bellum civile</em>), the
        words that make up the concept it defines, but also lacks the exclusivity
        necessary for it to function; it is vague. As I wrote in 2017 in a <a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://cal.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/cal/article/view/28855\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">review </a>of David Armitage\u2019s 2017 book:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>The terms \u201Cinclusive\u201D [Kalyvas\u2019
        vague definition] or \u201Cexclusive\u201D [something a kind of conventional
        war and battles between citizens] are often connected to definitions, as if
        we will somehow finally understand a concept by having agreed on its definition.
        Of course we all need definitions, mainly in order to agree that we are talking
        about the same thing (15-18, 219 n.50).</p>\\n<cite>Lange, Review of David
        Armitage, <em>Civil Wars: A History In Ideas</em> (2017)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Those
        of us who study civil war must accept that we are studying a spectrum of violence,
        from <em>stasis</em> and <em>seditio</em> to <em>bellum civile</em>: from
        <em>antebellum</em> to <em>bellum</em>. In terms of contemporary relevance,
        what we see today are debates about the naming of conflicts, similar to those
        in ancient times. I write about this in the book:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>Unsurprisingly, similar debates are also
        part of political landscapes today. On the night of the so-called <em>Capitol
        Riots</em> in 2021, NBC broadcast journalist Savannah Guthrie described the
        situation on live television as a \u201C<em>stasis</em>, for lack of a better
        word\u201D: that is, a period of debilitating and incapacitating civil strife
        or upheaval, taken directly from the Greek expression for \u201Cstandstill\u201D
        (\u03C3\u03C4\u03AC\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2), used in this book in its meaning of
        sedition. We will see in chapter 1 that these so-called riots have themselves
        already been described using numerous different concepts, all related in some
        way to <em>stasis</em>; Guthrie\u2019s comment is the ideal point of departure
        for any discussion about the enduring ambiguity of labels and definitions
        for internal conflict, in the modern world just as in the ancient. <em>Stasis</em>
        and civil war exert so profound an influence that societies must confront
        it in all periods.</p>\\n<cite>Lange, <em><em>From Hannibal to Sulla: The
        Birth of Civil War in Republican Rome</em></em> (forthcoming)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let\u2019s
        play around with a hypothetical scenario: what if the United States were to
        descend into civil war again? Barbara Walter, in her fine book <em>How Civil
        Wars Start. And How to Stop Them</em> (2022), is already ahead of us. According
        to her analysis, incidents such as the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen
        Whitmer in 2020, the so-called <em>Capitol Riots</em> in 2021, and the recent
        attack on Representative Nancy Pelosi and her husband in 2022 are indeed examples
        of a potentially unfolding civil war. As such, these events may one day be
        easily described by future historians as part of the \u2018antebellum\u2019
        period leading up to the <em>Second American Civil War</em>, to explain its
        genesis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I am an ancient historian specialising in Republican
        Rome, not a specialist in contemporary American politics, but I will say this
        as a scholar of civil war: Joanne Freeman, in her wonderful book <em>The Field
        of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War</em>, focuses on
        physical violence in the US Congress from 1830 to the outbreak of the Civil
        War (2018). It sheds new light on the systemic breakdown in the decades leading
        up to the Civil War. It allows us to ask whether we can have a relatively
        well-functioning political system and a systemic breakdown at the same time.
        The prelude to the American Civil War, and indeed Late Republican Rome, suggest
        just that; suggest that it is possible. There may be a growing fear \u2013
        with Barbara Walter \u2013 that something similar is afoot in contemporary
        US politics and society. The concept of polarisation is crucial to our understanding
        of current events. Another great book can help us decipher modern US politics.
        Ezra Klein says as much in <em>Why We\u2019re Polarised</em>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure
        class=\\\"wp-block-pullquote\\\"><blockquote><p>To appeal to a more polarized
        public, political institutions and political actors behave in more polarized
        ways. As political institutions and actors become more polarized, they further
        polarize the public.</p><cite>Ezra Klein, <em>Why We\u2019re Polarized</em>
        (2020), xix</cite></blockquote></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Citing once again from
        my book, \u201CThis could easily be a description of antebellum politics in
        ancient times, of ancient civil strife and civil war language.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Returning
        to the above debate about definitions of civil war, Barbara Walter, similar
        to Stathis Kalyvas, claims that (2022, xiv-xv): \u201CGone are the large battlefields,
        the armies, and the conventional tactics. Today, civil wars are waged by different
        ethnic and religious groups, by guerrilla soldiers and militias, who often
        target civilians.\u201D</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My answer I give in the book is
        as follows: \u201CThe issue here is, as mentioned, historicity\u2014an awareness
        of the repetitive nature of civil war and its features in earlier periods\u2014which
        is vital for us to compare conflicts over time. Problematically, this historicity
        is lost in her approach. In any case, what Walter discusses and defines as
        civil war would seem to any reader of Thucydides to clearly be not civil war
        but rather <em>stasis</em>. Walter\u2019s basic point regarding an (potentially)
        unfolding civil war can survive this, as this would, if a civil war happens,
        be its antebellum period (as mentioned in the introduction). There is however
        a distinct lack of language and knowledge of history.\u201D I wrote above
        that concepts change over time as they are used in a specific context. But
        this is simply too much and makes any comparison over time difficult or even
        impossible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than anything else, I fear that the legacy
        of Rome will be lost. Now, I understand that this may be difficult for non-historians
        to accept as a major problem, but in doing so we will ultimately lose the
        ability to understand the legacy of Rome, and we may lose the ability to understand
        the fundamentally repetitive nature of civil war (understanding historical
        similarities as opposed to history repeating itself).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Taking
        these issues further, the contemporary unfolding US debate about the 2020
        election and its aftermath, including the so-called <em>Capitol Riots</em>,
        is of great interest to an ancient historian working on civil war and related
        concepts. A debate about which concepts to use to describe what happened and
        what is happening, which happens to be very similar to debates about the changing
        nature of warfare and conflict in ancient times.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Former
        President Trump\u2019s incitement to violence (and arguably to a coup) may
        not be a straightforward repetition of past events in every respect, but there
        are certainly patterns. These patterns illustrate the fundamental relevance
        of history to our understanding of the world around us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        the end, <em>Capitol Riots</em> \u2013 a violent disturbance of the peace
        by a crowd of people \u2013 seems a poor choice of words; it hardly conveys
        the seriousness of what happened. In the book I write:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>The period from the 2020 US election onwards
        has more than anything shown that we today lack a nuanced language of internal
        political violence and conflict. Mainstream political discourse channelled
        through mass media lacks a spectrum of concepts related to organised violence,
        or perhaps better, we do not use them. Where attempts are made, they often
        stretch the semantic range of \u2018civil war\u2019 beyond recognition.&nbsp;
        &#8230; When the so-called Capitol Riots of 2021 are included, the term that
        springs to mind more readily than civil war is in fact political violence
        through insurrection\u2014as we shall see further below\u2014and <em>stasis</em>
        or <em>tumultus</em> or similar. But to claim that we might ultimately have
        a Second American Civil War is to invoke the legacy of one million military
        casualties of the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), of which as many as
        three-quarters died (&#8230;). This is about creating \u2013 perhaps even
        subconsciously \u2013 a mental picture of the horrors of not just civil war
        in principle, but the American Civil War in particular. All labels are of
        course political at the outset. We as scholars may agree that a conflict is
        either a civil war or not, but that may not reflect the language used to describe
        the war at the time.</p>\\n<cite>Lange, <em>From Hannibal to Sulla: The Birth
        of Civil War in Republican Rome</em> (forthcoming)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        this post is not about Trump, not about his norm-breaking presidency, not
        about the US Constitution which presupposes a peaceful transition of power,
        not about \u201Cthe president\u2019s infamous walk to St John\u2019s with
        his entourage, including Secretary of Defense Esper and Chairman of the Joint
        Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley in camouflage uniform, as well as Attorney
        General William Barr\u201D (from my book), and not about Trump wanting to
        send in the armed forces against protesters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But whatever
        we think of contemporary US politics, the storming of the Capitol on 6 January
        2021 has already changed the USA forever. The <em>House Select Committee to
        Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol</em> is a
        testament to an ongoing and still unfolding debate about the so-called <em>Capitol
        Riots</em>, but it is also a testament to a committee that seeks to inform
        and shape future debates. The report suggests that Trump took advantage of
        an unfolding situation of his own making. The evidence seems overwhelming
        to support this conclusion. Trump was plotting to overturn the outcome of
        the 2020 election.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is hardly the place to go into detail,
        but Chapter One is called <em>THE BIG LIE</em>! Suffice it to say that the
        phrase was used by Adolf Hitler in <em>Mein Kampf</em> (1925 Vol. 1, 244)
        to explain how people could be made to believe a colossal lie. Whether the
        comparison is fair or not is not the point. Polarisation is!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
        terms of the language of crisis, the report uses many terms to describe what
        has happened: Terrorist attack (3 times), incite/incitement (20 times, but
        intent 44 times), civil war (20 times), riot(s) (25 times), coup (89 times),
        sedition (87 times; seditious conspiracy (65 times)), insurrection (100 times),
        mob (126 times), conspiracy (200 times). One might have wished for some prioritisation,
        but more than anything this reflects an unfolding debate about what future
        generations might end up calling the so-called <em>Capitol Riots</em>. Suffice
        it to say that <em>stasis</em> is perhaps the best concept to use, at least
        seen from the perspective and through the lens of ancient history.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Writing
        about the American Civil War, Aaron Sheehan-Dean (2018, <em>The Calculus of
        Violence. How Americans Fought the Civil War</em>, 44) emphasises, \u201C[b]eyond
        their claims to a defensive and hence just position, the language each side
        used to frame its recourse to war in 1861 shaped how they behaved in the years
        to come\u201D. Translated into relevance today this is certainly food for
        thought. We can learn from history, and we need to accept its relevance today.
        But this can only happen if we accept the historicity of the concepts we use
        to describe contemporary (and past) conflicts. Not only do scholars working
        on the ancient use new words to describe old societies. We also use old words
        to describe modern society.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">References</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>David

        words and concepts we use to describe a particular war speak volumes about
        who we are as individuals and as a community, and where we stand in an unfolding
        conflict. Concepts have always been used to occupy the moral high ground.
        Rebellion, for example, is used to delegitimise those who rebel. In Rome,
        the allied communities were not legally Roman citizens and therefore their
        rebellion was not a 'civil war'. However, these non-citizens were considered
        part of the same polity as Roman citizens; the idea of an internal war was
        born, in debates in the Senate and beyond, debates between friends and foes.
        We debate! And sometimes we use violence, or even go to war against each other.
        It happens now, and it has happened many times in the past. The writings of
        contemporaries (and later sources) reflect these debates. From the outbreak
        of the Second Punic War in 218 to the Social War in 91, the Romans of the
        long second century had protracted debates about the changing nature of warfare
        -- including the rebellion of their allies in the midst of the Second Punic
        War -- conceptual and otherwise -- culminating in Rome's first civil war in
        88 BCE.\\n\\nAt its core, my forthcoming book, *From Hannibal to Sulla: The
        Birth of Civil War in Republican Rome* (*Studies in Ancient Civil War*, De
        Gruyter), attempts to trace these debates and to show how, over the course
        of the second century, the language of external war was slowly adapted to
        a new language of internal and, ultimately, civil war. It combines two ideas:
        1) the formative role of antebellum on the one hand, and 2) the importance
        of the 'great' war before the civil war on the other hand; in preparing for
        the next conflict, Rome looked back at the last great one. It suggests that
        the period from the Second Punic War constituted, conceptually speaking, an
        'antebellum' period to Rome's later civil wars. It traces the origins not
        only of the concept and terminology of the *bellum civile*, but also of related
        terms.\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-full\\\">\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/isbn/9783111335216/html\\\"><img

        history' (*Begriffsgeschichte*) in the manner of Reinhart Koselleck. The basic
        idea that, at some point in modernity, old words have acquired new meanings
        so that they no longer need to be translated seems overly simplistic, partly
        because it gives undue weight to modernity (it is close(r) to our contemporary
        world = it is modern = it is different from the non-modern world, or so the
        argument often seems to go. I work mostly on old stuff (= a long time ago),
        but it is just not pre-modern, it is very modern, conceptually speaking certainly
        so). It is true that some concepts recur throughout history, but even so we
        must accept, with Quentin Skinner, that they were never immutable and never
        had a (pre-)determined meaning. We can accept that the phenomenon of civil
        war recurs (with Thucydides' description of the *stasis* in Corcyra during
        the Peloponnesian War, 3.81-85) in the understanding that civil wars occur
        throughout history: Corcyra, the late Roman Republic, the late Roman Empire,
        the English Civil War, the American Civil War, and so on. More than anything,
        my book is about the history of the use of concepts rather than a history
        of concepts.\\n\\nWhat is more, however coherent definitions may be in theory,
        in practice they were as contestable in ancient times as they are today. Can
        we still believe -- in the spirit of positivism -- that deciphering the examples
        from our evidence will provide us with a correct basic definition of the concepts
        we are considering? Hardly! We should never accept that civil war is a concept
        that everyone agreed on in ancient times. Language has an unfortunate tendency
        to obscure the extent to which sources disagree, both in ancient times and
        today. Is *stasis* the same as civil war? *Stasis* can be a *polemos*, a (civil)
        war, but it can also be a sedition. The ancients simply never agreed on a
        definition of such slippery concepts as *stasis* and civil war. Why would
        they? Why would we? Concepts naturally change over time as they are used in
        a particular context.\\n\\nIn 43 BCE the warmonger Cicero was trying hard
        to get the proconsul M. Antonius (*cos*. 44) declared a *hostis publicus*.
        He was strenuously opposed in this endeavour by L. Iulius Caesar (*cos*. 64),
        who insisted that the term *bellum* be replaced with *tumultus* (*Phil*. 12.17):\\n\\n<figure
        class=\\\"wp-block-pullquote\\\">\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I consistently called
        Antonius a public enemy [<em>hostis</em>], while others [L. Iulius Caesar]
        called him an adversary [<em>adversarius</em>]; I consistently called this
        a war [<em>bellum</em>], while others called it a public emergency [<em>tumultus</em>].</p>\\n<p>Cic.
        <em>Phil</em>. 12.17</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThere has never
        been, and never will be, a single narrative. Reading, for example, David Armitage's
        fine 2017 book *Civil Wars. A History In Ideas*, it quickly becomes clear
        that the concept of civil war has always been, as I said, a slippery one.
        Importantly, I firmly believe that scholars should ultimately accept that
        we can safely assume that some features of ancient civil wars are indeed regular
        features of any civil war, and that we should therefore accept the civil war
        in ancient Rome as a valid and instructive example to consider in modern debates
        about civil war. This should come as no surprise! And it works just fine without
        history repeating itself.\\n\\nAccordingly, all scholars working on civil
        war---including social and political scientists---need to learn their history
        as well as the traditions of the concepts they apply. After all, history is
        the only laboratory we have. The next question must be about the consequences
        of such an approach.\\n\\nIn the book I write:\\n\\n> Through careful historicization,
        it is possible to highlight the ahistorical nature of modern definitions of
        civil war. All modern debates about civil war should ideally take the Late
        Republic as their conceptual point of departure: its genesis after lies there
        (a \\\"war\\\" between \\\"citizens\\\"). Alternatively, the concept needs
        to be abandoned by moderns altogether and the concept of \\\"internal war\\\"
        used instead (as famously proposed by Eckstein in 1965 \\\\[*On the Etiology
        of Internal Wars*\\\\]). The problem with this alternative new concept of
        \\\"internal war\\\" is that this, too, was already theorised by the Romans
        in Latin and is not new at all: *bellum intestinum*, mainly but not exclusively
        a concept used in connection with wars between Rome and its allies or within
        the polity of allies. The semantic range of civil wars is today being stretched
        to encompass ideological differences within for example political parties,
        so that there is a risk of it losing any conceptual specificity\\n>\\n> Lange,
        **From Hannibal to Sulla: The Birth of Civil War in Republican Rome** (forthcoming)\\n\\nThe
        problem today is that the concept of civil war is too often stripped of its
        basic meaning (citizenship and war). Not surprisingly, this is further complicated
        by issues such as the definition of war. When is a war a war? It is safe to
        say that a true civil war requires at least something resembling armies and
        battles, with actual fighting between citizens. In his famous book *The Logic
        of Violence in Civil War*, Stathis Kalyvas gives us a definition: \\\"armed
        combat within the borders of a recognised sovereign entity between parties
        subject to a common authority at the beginning of hostilities\\\" (2006, 17).
        His definition not only lacks references to and understanding of both *war*
        and *citizenship* (*bellum civile*), the words that make up the concept it
        defines, but also lacks the exclusivity necessary for it to function; it is
        vague. As I wrote in 2017 in a [review](https://cal.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/cal/article/view/28855){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"} of David Armitage's 2017 book:\\n\\n>
        The terms \\\"inclusive\\\" \\\\[Kalyvas' vague definition\\\\] or \\\"exclusive\\\"
        \\\\[something a kind of conventional war and battles between citizens\\\\]
        are often connected to definitions, as if we will somehow finally understand
        a concept by having agreed on its definition. Of course we all need definitions,
        mainly in order to agree that we are talking about the same thing (15-18,
        219 n.50).\\n>\\n> Lange, Review of David Armitage, *Civil Wars: A History
        In Ideas* (2017)\\n\\nThose of us who study civil war must accept that we
        are studying a spectrum of violence, from *stasis* and *seditio* to *bellum
        civile*: from *antebellum* to *bellum*. In terms of contemporary relevance,
        what we see today are debates about the naming of conflicts, similar to those
        in ancient times. I write about this in the book:\\n\\n> Unsurprisingly, similar
        debates are also part of political landscapes today. On the night of the so-called
        *Capitol Riots* in 2021, NBC broadcast journalist Savannah Guthrie described
        the situation on live television as a \\\"*stasis*, for lack of a better word\\\":
        that is, a period of debilitating and incapacitating civil strife or upheaval,
        taken directly from the Greek expression for \\\"standstill\\\" (\u03C3\u03C4\u03AC\u03C3\u03B9\u03C2),
        used in this book in its meaning of sedition. We will see in chapter 1 that
        these so-called riots have themselves already been described using numerous
        different concepts, all related in some way to *stasis*; Guthrie's comment
        is the ideal point of departure for any discussion about the enduring ambiguity
        of labels and definitions for internal conflict, in the modern world just
        as in the ancient. *Stasis* and civil war exert so profound an influence that
        societies must confront it in all periods.\\n>\\n> Lange, **From Hannibal
        to Sulla: The Birth of Civil War in Republican Rome** (forthcoming)\\n\\nLet's
        play around with a hypothetical scenario: what if the United States were to
        descend into civil war again? Barbara Walter, in her fine book *How Civil
        Wars Start. And How to Stop Them* (2022), is already ahead of us. According
        to her analysis, incidents such as the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen
        Whitmer in 2020, the so-called *Capitol Riots* in 2021, and the recent attack
        on Representative Nancy Pelosi and her husband in 2022 are indeed examples
        of a potentially unfolding civil war. As such, these events may one day be
        easily described by future historians as part of the 'antebellum' period leading
        up to the *Second American Civil War*, to explain its genesis.\\n\\nI am an
        ancient historian specialising in Republican Rome, not a specialist in contemporary
        American politics, but I will say this as a scholar of civil war: Joanne Freeman,
        in her wonderful book *The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road
        to Civil War*, focuses on physical violence in the US Congress from 1830 to
        the outbreak of the Civil War (2018). It sheds new light on the systemic breakdown
        in the decades leading up to the Civil War. It allows us to ask whether we
        can have a relatively well-functioning political system and a systemic breakdown
        at the same time. The prelude to the American Civil War, and indeed Late Republican
        Rome, suggest just that; suggest that it is possible. There may be a growing
        fear -- with Barbara Walter -- that something similar is afoot in contemporary
        US politics and society. The concept of polarisation is crucial to our understanding
        of current events. Another great book can help us decipher modern US politics.
        Ezra Klein says as much in *Why We're Polarised*:\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-pullquote\\\">\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>To
        appeal to a more polarized public, political institutions and political actors
        behave in more polarized ways. As political institutions and actors become
        more polarized, they further polarize the public.</p>\\n<p>Ezra Klein, <em>Why
        We\u2019re Polarized</em> (2020), xix</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</figure>\\n\\nCiting
        once again from my book, \\\"This could easily be a description of antebellum
        politics in ancient times, of ancient civil strife and civil war language.\\\"\\n\\nReturning
        to the above debate about definitions of civil war, Barbara Walter, similar
        to Stathis Kalyvas, claims that (2022, xiv-xv): \\\"Gone are the large battlefields,
        the armies, and the conventional tactics. Today, civil wars are waged by different
        ethnic and religious groups, by guerrilla soldiers and militias, who often
        target civilians.\\\"\\n\\nMy answer I give in the book is as follows: \\\"The
        issue here is, as mentioned, historicity---an awareness of the repetitive
        nature of civil war and its features in earlier periods---which is vital for
        us to compare conflicts over time. Problematically, this historicity is lost
        in her approach. In any case, what Walter discusses and defines as civil war
        would seem to any reader of Thucydides to clearly be not civil war but rather
        *stasis*. Walter's basic point regarding an (potentially) unfolding civil
        war can survive this, as this would, if a civil war happens, be its antebellum
        period (as mentioned in the introduction). There is however a distinct lack
        of language and knowledge of history.\\\" I wrote above that concepts change
        over time as they are used in a specific context. But this is simply too much
        and makes any comparison over time difficult or even impossible.\\n\\nMore
        than anything else, I fear that the legacy of Rome will be lost. Now, I understand
        that this may be difficult for non-historians to accept as a major problem,
        but in doing so we will ultimately lose the ability to understand the legacy
        of Rome, and we may lose the ability to understand the fundamentally repetitive
        nature of civil war (understanding historical similarities as opposed to history
        repeating itself).\\n\\nTaking these issues further, the contemporary unfolding
        US debate about the 2020 election and its aftermath, including the so-called
        *Capitol Riots*, is of great interest to an ancient historian working on civil
        war and related concepts. A debate about which concepts to use to describe
        what happened and what is happening, which happens to be very similar to debates
        about the changing nature of warfare and conflict in ancient times.\\n\\nFormer
        President Trump's incitement to violence (and arguably to a coup) may not
        be a straightforward repetition of past events in every respect, but there
        are certainly patterns. These patterns illustrate the fundamental relevance
        of history to our understanding of the world around us.\\n\\nIn the end, *Capitol
        Riots* -- a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd of people -- seems
        a poor choice of words; it hardly conveys the seriousness of what happened.
        In the book I write:\\n\\n> The period from the 2020 US election onwards has
        more than anything shown that we today lack a nuanced language of internal
        political violence and conflict. Mainstream political discourse channelled
        through mass media lacks a spectrum of concepts related to organised violence,
        or perhaps better, we do not use them. Where attempts are made, they often
        stretch the semantic range of 'civil war' beyond recognition.\_ ... When the
        so-called Capitol Riots of 2021 are included, the term that springs to mind
        more readily than civil war is in fact political violence through insurrection---as
        we shall see further below---and *stasis* or *tumultus* or similar. But to
        claim that we might ultimately have a Second American Civil War is to invoke
        the legacy of one million military casualties of the American Civil War (1861--1865),
        of which as many as three-quarters died (...). This is about creating -- perhaps
        even subconsciously -- a mental picture of the horrors of not just civil war
        in principle, but the American Civil War in particular. All labels are of
        course political at the outset. We as scholars may agree that a conflict is
        either a civil war or not, but that may not reflect the language used to describe
        the war at the time.\\n>\\n> Lange, *From Hannibal to Sulla: The Birth of
        Civil War in Republican Rome* (forthcoming)\\n\\nBut this post is not about
        Trump, not about his norm-breaking presidency, not about the US Constitution
        which presupposes a peaceful transition of power, not about \\\"the president's
        infamous walk to St John's with his entourage, including Secretary of Defense
        Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley in camouflage
        uniform, as well as Attorney General William Barr\\\" (from my book), and
        not about Trump wanting to send in the armed forces against protesters.\\n\\nBut
        whatever we think of contemporary US politics, the storming of the Capitol
        on 6 January 2021 has already changed the USA forever. The *House Select Committee
        to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol* is a testament
        to an ongoing and still unfolding debate about the so-called *Capitol Riots*,
        but it is also a testament to a committee that seeks to inform and shape future
        debates. The report suggests that Trump took advantage of an unfolding situation
        of his own making. The evidence seems overwhelming to support this conclusion.
        Trump was plotting to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.\\n\\nThis
        is hardly the place to go into detail, but Chapter One is called *THE BIG
        LIE*! Suffice it to say that the phrase was used by Adolf Hitler in *Mein
        Kampf* (1925 Vol. 1, 244) to explain how people could be made to believe a
        colossal lie. Whether the comparison is fair or not is not the point. Polarisation
        is!\\n\\nIn terms of the language of crisis, the report uses many terms to
        describe what has happened: Terrorist attack (3 times), incite/incitement
        (20 times, but intent 44 times), civil war (20 times), riot(s) (25 times),
        coup (89 times), sedition (87 times; seditious conspiracy (65 times)), insurrection
        (100 times), mob (126 times), conspiracy (200 times). One might have wished
        for some prioritisation, but more than anything this reflects an unfolding
        debate about what future generations might end up calling the so-called *Capitol
        Riots*. Suffice it to say that *stasis* is perhaps the best concept to use,
        at least seen from the perspective and through the lens of ancient history.\\n\\nWriting
        about the American Civil War, Aaron Sheehan-Dean (2018, *The Calculus of Violence.
        How Americans Fought the Civil War*, 44) emphasises, \\\"\\\\[b\\\\]eyond
        their claims to a defensive and hence just position, the language each side
        used to frame its recourse to war in 1861 shaped how they behaved in the years
        to come\\\". Translated into relevance today this is certainly food for thought.
        We can learn from history, and we need to accept its relevance today. But
        this can only happen if we accept the historicity of the concepts we use to
        describe contemporary (and past) conflicts. Not only do scholars working on
        the ancient use new words to describe old societies. We also use old words
        to describe modern society.\\n\\n## References {#references .wp-block-heading}\\n\\n-
