        the work on streamlining the DOI assignment for new blog\\nposts in the [Rogue
        Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        I discovered and\\nfixed a major bug. Rogue Scholar DOIs strings are generated
        from a\\nrandom number and include a checksum. It turns out that this checksum\\nwas
        wrong, affecting all Rogue Scholar posts generated with the\\n[commonmeta
        Go\\nlibrary](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nbetween
        May 2024 and today.\\n\\nWhen working as Technical Director at the DOI registration
        agency\\n[DataCite](https://datacite.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}, I was always
        jealous\\nof persistent identifier systems that put more thought into the\\nstructure
        of the identifier. DOIs are made up of a prefix that starts\\nwith 10.x (where
        x can be four or five digits), followed by a suffix\\nthat can basically be
        anything. For example this:\\n\\n    https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1409(199908/10)3:6/7<672::AID-JPP192>3.0.CO;2-8\\n\\nThis
        DOI suffix is actually a\\n[SICI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Serial
        Item and Contribution Identifier), adopted as a NISO standard in\\n1996 and
        used for some early DOIs (and [withdrawn in\\n2012](https://www.niso.org/sites/default/files/stories/2017-09/SS_State_of_the_Standards_Jan_2013_isqv25no1.pdf){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nThere
        are three big problems with this DOI:\\n\\n- some characters don\\\\'t work
        well in URLs, in particular `<` or `>`,\\n  and need to be escaped,\\n- the
        identifier includes meaning (e.g. ISSN, publication date, and page\\n  numbers)
        that might change over time and is better stored in DOI\\n  metadata,\\n-
        the identifier is long and complicated, increasing the risk of\\n  transmission
        errors.\\n\\nDOIs have been around for more than 20 years, so it is very\\nhard/impossible
        to change how a DOI suffix should look like. But any\\norganization registering
        DOIs can follow best practices, and in 2016 I\\nwrote about some of them in
        a post I called [Cool\\nDOIs](https://doi.org/10.53731/r79x921-97aq74v-ag5a2){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure

        since been addressed, e.g. the use of **HTTPS**\\ninstead of **HTTP** and
        **doi.org** instead of **dx.doi.org**. Not\\nincluding semantic info in the
        DOI string is a constant struggle,\\ninstead of SICIs we now see attempts
        to include the journal name,\\npublication date, or version number in the
        identifier.\\n\\nUsing base32-encoding for DOI suffix generation starting
        with a large\\nrandom number is something I came up with at the time. DOIs
        are\\ncase-insensitive so that base64-encoding, e.g. used in [YouTube\\nidentifiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnWocYKqvhw){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nwouldn\\\\'t
        work.\\n[Base32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        uses an\\nalphabet of 32 digits, which makes the identifier more compact than
        a\\nnumerical identifier (10 digits if using the decimal system) such as an\\nORCID
        ID. UUIDs such as **816c08de-750e-4d6d-a96f-f995dc1a366a** are an\\nalternative,
        but at the time I found them too long (32 digits) to be\\npractical and because
        DOIs use a prefix, a unique identifier based on a\\nrandom string only needs
        to be unique within the DOIs of that\\norganization, making the task easier.\\n\\nThere
        are several flavors of base32-encoding around, a popular one was\\ndeveloped
        by [Douglas\\nCrockford](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.
        He\\nuses the alphabet (minus the letters A, I, O and U) and digits for the\\n32
        keys and allows optional hyphens and checksums. One frequently used\\nchecksum
        is **mod 97-10** or [ISO\\n7064](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7064){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.
        I\\nwrote the\\n[base32-url](https://rubygems.org/gems/base32-url){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nRuby
        gem to implement this in the Ruby programming language, and it is\\nused in
        DataCite service infrastructure whenever a random DOI string is\\nneeded.
        The InvenioRDM project wrote a [Python\\nimplementation](https://pypi.org/project/base32-lib/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nused
        to generate DOI suffixes for the repository software.\\n\\nWhen the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive started registering DOIs for\\nblog posts, it
        used the same Python library and in the same\\nconfiguration (10 digits with
        a hyphen after five digits, and a\\ntwo-digit mod 97-10 checksum at the end).
        In [May 2024 I switched to\\nusing the commonmeta\\nGo](https://doi.org/10.53731/43qt9-x6p52){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        library I\\nwrote for Rogue Scholar DOI registration. For this, I implemented\\nCrockford
        base32 encoding in Go. Unfortunately I made one mistake and\\nonly fully realized
        it this week: the checksum was not generated\\nproperly. This means that checksum
        checks for those DOIs are broken, but\\nof course they work as expected in
        any other way. Today I [released a\\nfix for this\\nbug](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14671594){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and all\\nRogue Scholar DOIs registered starting today have properly working\\nchecksums.\\n\\nAs
        a bonus I implemented a new **decode** command in the commonmeta\\nlibrary
        that can be used from the command line:\\n\\n    commonmeta decode https://doi.org/10.59350/kqy47-4zz67\\n\\nThis
        command returns `678542152703`, the random number used to generate\\nthat
        DOI suffix. The checksum is `67`, and if the checksum is wrong an\\nerror
        message is returned, as is the case for DOIs registered with older\\nversions
        of the commonmeta Go library:\\n\\n``` `\\ncommonmeta decode https://doi.org/10.54900/d3ck1-skq19\\n```\\n\\nThis
        returns an error:\\n\\n``` `\\nwrong checksum 19 for identifier d3ck1-skq19\\n```\\n\\nCommonmeta
        also understands DOIs from other organizations using\\nbase32-encoding, e.g.
        repositories running the InvenioRDM software:\\n\\n    commonmeta decode https://doi.org/10.22002/fcw7t-a3s32\\n\\nThe
        DataCite and Make Data Count blogs:\\n\\n    commonmeta decode https://doi.org/10.60804/1nhk-qd72\\n\\nThe
        ROR organizational identifier also uses Crockford base32-encoding\\nand mod
        97-10 checksums (I came up with the identifier format in late\\n2018 when
        helping launch the initial ROR service):\\n\\n    commonmeta decode https://ror.org/00pd74e08\\n\\nThis
        command returns `23501966`. ROR uses no hyphens and seven digits\\n(where
        the first digit is always 0).\\n\\nORCID doesn\\\\'t use base32-encoding and
        uses mod 11-2 checksums, and it\\nuses the [same identifier format as\\nISNI](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897674-Structure-of-the-ORCID-Identifier){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(International
        Standard Name Identifier). The **decode** command checks\\nthe checksum and
        also looks at the number range reserved for ORCID.\\n\\n``` `\\ncommonmeta
        decode https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-240X\\n```\\n\\nThis made-up ORCID
        ID (my ORCID ID with a different checksum) results in\\nthis:\\n\\n    wrong
        checksum X for identifier 0000-0003-1419-240X\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nBest
        practices for the structure of persistent identifiers have evolved\\nover
        the years, and in this blog post I have just scratched the surface\\nand looked
        at some PIDs relevant to Rogue Scholar, namely DOI, ROR, and\\nORCID. They
        all use (or can use) random strings and checksums and I\\nadded a command
        to the commonmeta library and command-line tool to\\ndecode these random strings
        and use checksums to verify identifiers. I\\nfixed a bug affecting checksums
        in the commonmeta Go library and the\\nlibrary now works interchangeably with
        the Python and Ruby\\nimplementations of the Crockford base32-encoding.\\n\\nGoing
        forward this will allow Rogue Scholar to be more flexible with DOI\\nregistration.
        Participating blogs can provide DOI strings in the\\nmetadata ([ideally using
        the id/guid in the RSS/Atom/JSON\\nFeed](https://doi.org/10.53731/m9d5v-xmr74){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        and Rogue\\nScholar can check these strings for uniqueness, checksums, and
        the\\ncorrect DOI prefix. The first blogs participating in Rogue Scholar have\\nstarted
        to implement this approach, including of course this blog.\\nPlease [reach
        out](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} if you\\nneed help
        with this or have general questions or feedback regarding\\npersistent identifiers

        />\\n</figure>\\n\\nRSS feeds have a corresponding field called `<guid>` and
        JSON Feed also\\nuses `<id>`. Two other blogs participating in Rogue Scholar
        also use the\\n`id`/`guid` and I have updated Rogue Scholar accordingly:\\n[Upstream](https://rogue-scholar.org/communities/upstream){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand\\n[chem-bla-ics](https://rogue-scholar.org/communities/chem_bla_ics){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        `id`/`guid` is used by feed readers, and also the Rogue Scholar API,\\nto
        determine whether blog content is new or only has moved to a\\ndifferent location
        -- to a different host or using a different schema to\\ngenerate the URL.
        A good example of the latter is permalinks in\\nWordPress: <https://blog.dini.de/EPub_FIS/?p=3605>
        and\\n<https://blog.dini.de/EPub_FIS/2025/01/06/barcelona-declaration> point\\nto
        the same page. Deciding that a blog post is new based on the URL is\\ntherefore
        tricky, and Rogue Scholar had switched to using the\\n`id`/`guid`provided
        by all RSS feeds in [November\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/fy5gh-g0w69){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nOne
        challenge with the `id`/`guid` provided by static site generators\\nsuch as
        Hugo, Jekyll or Quarto is that it is often the same as the URL\\nand therefore
        may change over time. It is better to use a stable unique\\nstring such as
        an `UUID` or use a DOI, and then store that string in the\\nblog post front
        matter.\\n\\nWhen using the DOI as `id`/`guid` another potential issue may
        come up\\nwith new posts: either the `id`/`guid` may point to a DOI string
        that is\\nnot yet registered with the DOI system, or the `id`/`guid` changes
        when\\nthe DOI is registered after publication, potentially confusing the
        feed\\nreader. One solution would be to use [pending publication\\nDOIs](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/pending-publications/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        the extra effort involved is probably not worth it as Rogue Scholar\\nregisters
        DOIs within minutes after blog post publication. As the\\n`id`/`guid` is used
        as a globally unique identifier in RSS feeds and not\\nused to resolve links,
        it should be fine to have a public`id`/`guid`\\nthat for a few minutes is
        not yet registered as DOI. This simplifies the\\nworkflow of blogs using DOIs
        as it no longer requires a second step of\\nblog updates after DOI registration.\\n\\nThere
        are still details to sort out, but if you have a blog\\nparticipating in Rogue
        Scholar, you can install the commonmeta\\n[Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/front-matter/commonmeta){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor
        [Python](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary
        and generate a DOI string with the DOI prefix assigned to your\\nblog:\\n\\n
        \   commonmeta encode 10.5555\\n\\nThis will return a string similar to\\n[`https://doi.org/10.5555/5raav-08t93`](https://doi.org/10.5555/5raav-08t93)\\nand
        you can include this string in the RSS feed of your blog. When the\\nblog
        post is published, Rogue Scholar will register the DOI with the\\nmetadata
        for the post included in the feed.\\n\\nOne remainingabout is storing the
        DOI in the blog backend, including the\\nDOI in the RSS feed, and showing
        the DOI in the blog frontend. Watch\\nthis blog for updates on this in the

        [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        depends on RSS\\nfeeds to automatically collect metadata and content.\\n[Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[JSON
        Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}, and JSON APIs\\n(e.g.
        for the WordPress, Ghost, or Substack platforms) are closely\\nrelated to
        RSS. The Rogue Scholar API understands these different\\nformats and regularly
        (currently every 10 min) checks participating\\nblogs for new or updated content
        and associated metadata.\\n\\nRogue Scholar registers DOIs for posts of participating
        blogs using\\nthese metadata, unless the blog is doing its own DOI registration.
        The\\nlatter makes sense if the blog is run by an organization that is a\\nCrossref
        or DataCite member and this is currently the case for six blogs\\nparticipating
        in Rogue Scholar. Unfortunately, the DOIs registered by\\nthese six blogs
        are not included in their respective RSS/Atom feeds,\\nrequiring manual work
        (copying/pasting the DOI into the Rogue Scholar\\ndatabase) for every new
        blog post.\\n\\nThis is an issue when a blog publishes frequently or a new
        blog with\\nhundreds of posts is added to Rogue Scholar. Also, the metadata
        that\\nRogue Scholar shows come from the RSS feed and sometimes are slightly\\ndifferent
        from the DOI metadata, depending on how the blog registers\\nthose DOI metadata.\\n\\nAnother
        issue is that blogs participating in Rogue Scholar sometimes\\nwant to know
        the DOI at publication time, e.g. when the blog posts are\\nanticipated to
        be widely shared. My main goals regarding DOI\\nregistration when starting
        Rogue Scholar in 2023 were twofold:\\n\\n- provide DOI registration for bloggers
        who can\\\\'t afford Crossref or\\n  DataCite membership (at least \\\\$275
        or \u20AC3000 a year respectively, plus\\n  a fee for each DOI),\\n- make
        DOI registration quick and easy while still providing relevant\\n  metadata.
        This goal was addressed by automating as much as possible,\\n  and building
        workflows that reduced DOI registration to less than 30\\n  min after publication
        of the blog post.\\n\\nWhile these goals have been achieved, the issues mentioned
        above need to\\nbe addressed, and one crucial step is to include the DOI in
        the RSS\\nfeed.\\n\\nRSS feeds have two metadata elements for each *item*
        that are relevant\\nhere:\\n\\n### guid\\n\\nguid stands for globally unique
        identifier. It\\\\'s a string that uniquely\\nidentifies the item. When present,
        an aggregator may choose to use this\\nstring to determine if an item is new.
        Called **id** in Atom and JSON\\nFeed.\\n\\n### link\\n\\nThe URL of the item.
        Called **url** in JSON Feed.\\n\\nFor DOI registration a DOI and url are needed,
        so that the DOI resolver\\nat https://doi.org can redirect DOI requests to
        the registered url. DOIs\\nare globally unique identifiers so they can work
        as **guid**/**id** in\\nyour blog feed. This is straightforward if you have
        full control of how\\nyour feed is generated.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is
        often not the case and your blog may be hosted\\nelsewhere with only limited
        options for customizing the feed of your\\ncontent. With blogs powered by
        databases (e.g. WordPress or Ghost) that\\nincludes a place in the database
        where you can store the DOI. A good\\noption is a field for a custom **canonical
        url** which for example the\\nGhost platform provides. WordPress -- by far
        the most popular blogging\\nplatform -- unfortunately has no built-in support
        for storing DOIs or\\ncanonical DOIs and requires a plugin.\\n\\nThe Atom
        feed format has several important advantages over RSS,\\nincluding the support
        for author metadata (e.g. the ORCID ID) and\\nmultiple authors, but also support
        for a post modification date. In the\\ncontext of DOI support, another feature
        is important: support of\\nmultiple **links** via the **rel** attribute, e.g.
        **rel**=\\\\\\\"alternate\\\\\\\"\\nfor the post url and\\n**rel**=\\\\\\\"[cite-as](https://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/8574){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\\\\\\"\\nfor
        the post DOI. The JSON Feed spec has **url** and **external_url**,\\nand **external_url**
        can be used to include the DOI (not equivalent to\\n**cite-as** but close
        enough for practical purposes).\\n\\nIn the coming months, Rogue Scholar will
        add support for these various\\nways to include DOIs in blog feeds. Please
        [reach\\nout](mailto:info@rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} if you
        are\\ninterested in (or have already added) this functionality. I will start\\nwork

        at risk of disappearing in\\nwhat I described in the [Rogue Scholar 111 Pledge\\nDrive](https://doi.org/10.53731/31k6z-6a925){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        in\\nNovember: personal blogs that have existed for more than 10 years with\\nmore
        than 100 posts. The\\n[Depth-First](https://depth-first.com){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        blog is a\\nspecial case as the author in 2024 sadly died from brain cancer.

        the most part adding blogs to Rogue Scholar is a straightforward\\nsemi-automated
        business that takes less than one hour. The main issue is\\nbroken RSS feeds
        or feeds that don\\\\'t include the full-text content, as\\nI [wrote about
        last\\nweek](https://doi.org/10.53731/pzvna-jcs28){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.
        One issue\\nI encountered more than once in the December group is blogs that\\nregister
        their own DOIs but don\\\\'t make them available in the RSS feed,\\nrequiring
        lots of copy/pasting if the blog has been around for many\\nyears. Rogue Scholar
        includes blogs that do their own DOI registration\\nas well as blogs where
        Rogue Scholar does the DOI registration (the\\nmajority). More work is needed
        in 2025 to standardize the automated\\nexchange of DOIs, which is also a major
        issue for blogs retrieving the\\nDOIs registered by Rogue Scholar. Alex Holcombe
        wrote a blog post [about\\nsome issues he had joining Rogue\\nScholar](https://doi.org/10.59350/xkwjs-dwx58){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and\\nthere is work for me to address this going forward.\\n\\nBut for now,
        enjoy the holidays. And maybe take the opportunity to read\\nsome of the newly
        added content, lots of interesting posts that I hope\\nRogue Scholar makes
        more visible and easier to find.\\n\\n## Blogs joining Rogue Scholar in December

        October 16, 2024, the Rogue Scholar Advisory Board met for the second\\ntime

        Since January\\nRogue Scholar has achieved several major milestones.\\n\\nIn
        May, DOI registration was [[switched to using a new commonmeta Go\\nlibrary]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.53731/43qt9-x6p52).
        This switch\\nallows faster and more flexible DOI registrations and updates\\n(supporting
        both Crossref and DataCite), which now routinely happen\\nwithin minutes of
        blog post publication.\\n\\nIn July Rogue Scholar [[dropped all registration
        fees for\\nauthors]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.53731/xkfsa-xkk56) (before
        up\\nto 50 posts per year and personal blogs were free) and became a Diamond\\nOpen
        Access platform. Running costs were kept low (about 3000 EUR per\\nyear) by
        continuing to use open-source software, automation as much as\\npossible (e.g.
        metadata and content extraction and DOI registration),\\nand community participation
        \xAD\xAD\xAD. All participating blogs are run by\\ncommunity members, and
        they write, edit, and publish all posts. Going\\nforward Rogue Scholar will
        depend on donations and grant funding,\\nsimilar to other Diamond Open Access
        infrastructures.\\n\\nRogue Scholar continued platform growth with 117 participating
        blogs and\\n17,478 blog posts on October 9, 2024. Worth mentioning is an increase
        in\\nblogs using the Quarto blogging platform and Spanish-language blogs in\\nrecent
        months.\\n\\nRogue Scholar migrated to the InvenioRDM open-source repository
        platform\\nstarting in June 2024 and completed the migration of\\n[[https://rogue-scholar.org]{.underline}](https://rogue-scholar.org)
        in\\nNovember 2024. Rogue Scholar migrated many existing functionalities to\\nInvenioRDM,
        including full-text search which is not part of the\\nInvenioRDM platform.
        InvenioRDM also allowed Rogue Scholar to add new\\nfunctionalities, in particular
        aggregation of blog posts around the same\\ntopic in\\n[[communities]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.53731/dv8z6-a6s33).\\n\\nThe
        Rogue Scholar Advisory Board discussed the opportunities and\\nchallenges
        of running Diamond Open Access scholarly infrastructure. It\\nsees the Rogue
        Scholar platform as mature enough in terms of features\\nand adoption by the
        scholarly community to seek grant funding going\\nforward.\\n\\nOne area that
        needs further work is the better two-way integration with\\nparticipating
        blogs, in particular integration of the DOIs issued by\\nRogue Scholar into
        the blog frontend and backend, but also help with\\nreference management.
        As 2024 comes to a close, Rogue Scholar looks\\nforward to an exciting 2025.\\n\\n##

        of us probably immediately recognize this document as a scholarly\\narticle.
        This immediate recognition includes essential parts of an\\narticle such as
        the title -- or the reference list:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\\\"http://datacite.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/article2-1.png\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        immediate recognition is a powerful concept, it makes it easy for\\nthe reader
        to navigate a scholarly document, e.g.\_to quickly jump to the\\nabstract
        or references.\\n\\nWe don't have the same immediate recognition for datasets.
        Given that a\\nlarge number of datasets in DataCite are in CSV (comma separated
        values)\\nformat, the closest we come to a immediately recognized document
        is\\nprobably the spreadsheet:\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"http://datacite.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spreadsheet_animation.gif\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        noreferrer\\\"}.*\\n\\nA canonical format for datasets goes beyond immediate
        recognition of the\\nessential parts by the user, it would also greatly facilitate
        reuse of\\ndata. As [Nick\\nStenning](https://twitter.com/nickstenning){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} from the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN)\\npointed out at
        CSV.conf last year, the cost of shipping of goods is in\\nlarge part determined
        by the cost of loading and unloading, and the\\ncontainer has dramatically
        changed that equation. He argued that common\\nformats such as the OKFN [data\\npackage](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} could do the same for data reuse.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"http://datacite.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/break-bulk-sacks.png\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        noreferrer\\\"}.*\\n\\nUnfortunately there are at least three problems with
        using spreadsheets\\nas canonical format for datasets:\\n\\n- not every dataset
        can be represented as a CSV file, there are many\\n  specialized formats (including
        of course Excel `.xlsx`)\\n- we can't include descriptive metadata (not even
        authors or document\\n  title) in a CSV file\\n- many datasets actually include
        a collecting of files: not only in CSV\\n  format, but also other data formats
        and support files such as a\\n  README.\\n\\nThe approach taken by the OKFN
        data package format -- and related\\nformats such as the [Research Object\\nBundle](https://researchobject.github.io/specifications/bundle/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} -- is to put all data files (in CSV or other\\nformats) into
        a folder, together with a standardized machine-readable\\nfile that includes
        the metadata (e.g.\_title, authors, publication date\\nand license). This
        folder can then compressed with `zip`, again yielding\\na single file (a very
        common approach used for example for `epub` and\\n`docx`).\\n\\nThe concept
        described here (a collection of documents in a larger\\ncontainer, and a listing
        of all included documents) is of course at\\nleast as old as the scholarly
        article: the **book** as a canonical\\nformat for collections (of texts),
        and the **table of contents** to\\ndescribe what is in the book.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"http://datacite.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Table_of_Contents_PANARCHIE_published_in_1860.jpg\\\"\\ndecoding=\\\"async\\\"

        noreferrer\\\"}.*\\n\\nThe approach described here would not only help package
        datasets into a\\nmore reusable standard format, but the scholarly article
        would also\\ngreatly benefit from migrating to a container format. We all
        know that\\nthe concept of the scholarly article described at the beginning
        of this\\nposts is falling apart -- an article is simply no longer a single
        text\\ndocument. We have not only associated figures and tables, but also\\nassociated
        files that can't be easily included into the article PDF, in\\nparticular
        files that contain the data underlying the findings of the\\narticle, but
        also other supplementary information.\\n\\nThere are currently three common
        approaches referencing the underlying\\ndata in a scholarly article:\\n\\n-
        inclusion in supporting information files without any specific linking\\n-
        informal citation in the article text, most commonly in the materials\\n  and
        methods section\\n- formal citation with inclusion in the reference list\\n\\nUntil
        not too long ago I was a big proponent of including all data\\nassociated
        with an article in the reference list, mainly to make it\\neasier to find
        the data. But the reference list isn't the appropriate\\nplace for something
        that is really part of the article -- or as\\ncolleague [Todd\\nVision](http://bio.unc.edu/people/faculty/vision/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} puts it: the data generated for an article\\nare another **output**
        rather than an **input**. Reference lists\\nsummarize all the inputs to an
        article, whereas outputs belong into a\\n**table of contents**. A table of
        contents isn't a standard feature of\\nscholarly articles yet, but to me is
        a logical next step for the journal\\narticle format, together with using
        the underlying concept of a\\ncontainer format described earlier in this post.
        Extracting references\\nto datasets from a table of contents should be as
        easy as extracting\\nthem from a reference list, in particular if we make
        sure that this\\ntable of contents is openly available.\\n\\nJournal Article
        Tag Suite\\n([JATS](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener

        noreferrer\\\"} (comma-separated values) is a popular file\\nformat for data.
        It is popular because it is very simple: CSV is\\ntext-based and any application
        that can open text files can read or\\nwrite CSV. This makes it a good fit
        for [digital\\npreservation](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}. We don't know how many of the datasets in\\nDataCite use
        CSV because the `format` metadata attribute is not used\\nmuch ([this query](https://search.datacite.org/works?query=format%3Acsv)\\ngives
        you some examples), but we know that the number is big.\\n\\nThe CSV format
        has two important shortcomings: a) it is not clearly\\ndefined, and b) because
        of its simplicity it is almost impossible to add\\nmetadata describing the
        data in the CSV file. The closest thing we have\\nto a CSV standard definition
        is [RFC\\n4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}, but that RFC clearly states that *It does\\nnot specify an
        Internet standard of any kind*.\\n\\nIf for some reason you think that the
        above sounds very similar to the\\nsituation with *markdown*, a simple format
        for text documents that\\n[until recently](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.22/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} was not clearly defined and that provides no\\neasy way to
        add metadata (such as author, title or date), then you are\\nsmarter than
        me, since I didn't see the connection until [Javier\\nRovegno](https://github.com/jrovegno){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} [commented on my personal blog last\\nweek](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/#comment-2220461075){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}. He\\n[proposes](http://jrovegno.github.io/csvy/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} to use the *YAML frontmatter* spec for CSV\\nfiles, and I
        think it is a brilliant idea.\\n\\n[YAML\\nfrontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} is a popular way to add metadata to markdown\\nfiles. [YAML](http://yaml.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} is a data serialization format that is very\\nhuman-readable
        (in contrast to XML and to a lesser degree JSON).\\nFrontmatter simply means
        to have the YAML section at the beginning of\\nthe document, e.g.\_the following,
        taken from the [Pandoc\\ndocumentation](http://pandoc.org/README.html){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n``` wp-block-code\\n---\\ntitle:  'This is the title:
        it contains a colon'\\nauthor:\\n- name: Author One\\n  affiliation: University
        of Somewhere\\n- name: Author Two\\n  affiliation: University of Nowhere\\ntags:
        [nothing, nothingness]\\nabstract: |\\n  This is the abstract.\\n\\n  It consists
        of two paragraphs.\\n---\\n```\\n\\nBy adding a similar section to CSV files
        we can add arbitrary metadata,\\nincluding longer text such as a file description.
        In other words, all\\nthe metadata required to submit a CSV to a data repository
        and obtain a\\nDOI. This makes data submission even simpler than using a zip
        bundle [as\\ndiscussed in an earlier\\npost](https://doi.org/10.5438/5aeg-weev){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\" data-type=\\\"link\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.5438/5aeg-weev\\\"},
        or using the [DataUp\\ntool](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.3-6.v2){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}, a Microsoft Excel add-in that is\\nunfortunately no longer
        available.\\n\\nJavier has picked `.csvy` as file extension for this modified
        file\\nformat (I like `.ycsv` a little bit better). I don't think we need
        to\\ndefine what metadata can go into the YAML frontmatter, because there
        a\\nnumber of different use cases. The only exception would be a\\nstandardized
        way to describe the columns in the CSV file, e.g.:\\n\\n``` wp-block-code\\n---\\ncolumns:\\n
        \ - title: Purchase Date\\n    type: date\\n  - title: Item\\n    type: string\\n
        \ - title: Amount (\u20AC)\\n    type: float\\n---\\n```\\n\\nThe best alternative
        to using CSV in combination with YAML is JSON, but\\nthat format is probably
        less popular than CSV for the typical data\\nscientist (I like JSON for nested
        data, which would be very painful in\\nCSV). Most people generate a separate
        file for CSV metadata now, risking\\nthat the data and metadata are separated.\\n\\nMany
        tools for reading CSV files -- including Microsoft Excel and the\\n`read.csv`
        function in R -- can ignore an arbitrary number of lines at\\nthe beginning
        of a CSV file, making the proposed format at least to some\\nextend backwards-compatible.
        But I hope to soon see tools reading and\\nwriting YAML frontmatter in CSV
        files, taking full advantage of the\\nformat. In my own work I produce a lot
        of CSV files using R, and adding\\nmetadata to them will greatly enhance their
        usability. Even better if we\\nstart to see YAML frontmatter support for CSV
        in multiple languages,\\nincluding Python, Javascript, Ruby and Julia.\\n\\nThe

        We develop and maintain our services based on data.\\n\\nThis shouldn't come
        as a surprise as DataCite's mission is **Helping you\\nto find, access and
        reuse data**. And my last job at the Open Access\\npublisher [PLOS](http://plos.org){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener

        noreferrer\\\"} about the reuse of scholarly articles\\n(citations, downloads,
        social media mentions, etc.). But here I mean\\n**data** in a much broader
        sense.\\n\\n## Product Development {#product-development .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nWhile
        the overall strategic direction is determined by the Board\\ntogether with
        the DataCite working groups and members, we can collect\\ndata that help with
        decisions in product development, for example\\n\\n- service monitoring (see
        below): how are our services used over time,\\n  are there any components
        that are particularly popular, etc.\\n- [user feedback](https://www.uservoice.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n

        \ allowing a more open discussion\\n- community events\\n\\nCompared with
        the next two sections, tools for data-driven product\\ndevelopment are less

        Software Development {#software-development .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nThe data
        generated during software development are increasingly made\\navailable through

        in [continuous integration\\n  servers](https://travis-ci.org/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n
        \ rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"}\\n- check [test coverage and overall code\\n
        \ quality](https://codeclimate.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n  rel=\\\"noopener

        \ rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"}, including traffic to particular pages,\\n
        \ percentage of mobile and non-English users, etc.\\n- specific monitoring
        for the services you are offering, e.g.\_in the\\n  case of DataCite [number
        of DOIs\\n  registered](http://stats.datacite.org/) (broken down by data center),\\n
        \ number of DOIs with specific metadata (e.g.\_ORCID identifiers for\\n  creators
        and funding information), and number of DOI resolutions\\n  (tricky because
        there is no easy way to filter out bots)\\n- user-generated feedback (see
        section product development)\\n\\n## Communication {#communication .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nWe
        don't want to stop at collecting all these data, we also need a\\nstrategy
        for providing them to the DataCite Board, DataCite working\\ngroups, DataCite
        members and data centers, DataCite staff, and everyone\\nelse who cares about
        these data. The default should be open, exceptions\\nare mostly data that
        would raise privacy or security concerns, e.g.\_IP\\naddresses in usage stats.
        Most of the services mentioned in this post\\nare open for everyone to look
        at.\\n\\n## Synthesis {#synthesis .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nGood data-driven
        development should not only collect lots of data and\\nmake them available,
        but we also need to aggregate the information in\\nmeaningful ways. Service
        monitoring is a good example where staff needs\\nto understand exactly what
        is going on, but the typical DataCite user\\nonly cares about whether all
        services are running as expected. A [status\\ndashboard](https://status.github.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} would be a good solution here.\\n\\nThe data we are generating
        also need to be put into the broader context.\\nWe need\\n\\n- the DataCite
        Board to use them for strategic planning\\n- to provide these data to the
        DataCite working groups to feed into\\n  their work (e.g.\_stats on what metadata
        are submitted by data centers\\n  for the [Metadata Working\\n  Group](https://www.datacite.org/tags/metadata-working-group)\\n-
        the DataCite staff to integrate them in their work (e.g.\_the\\n  Communications
        Director utilizing the website usage stats)\\n- these data to adapt the software
        development roadmap and service\\n  infrastructure\\n\\n## Implementation
        {#implementation .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nOf course I am aware that this is
        an ambitious agenda, in particular\\nsince DataCite is a small non-profit
        that has limited staff and\\nfinancial resources. But I don't think that data-drive
        development\\nshould be left to for-profit organizations and/or to organizations
        of a\\ncertain size. There are several things DataCite can do:\\n\\n- implement
        DDD practices over time, starting with one service and one\\n  aspect\\n-
        use service providers wherever it makes sense ([there is a future\\n  where
        you yourself are running less\\n  servers](http://thenewstack.io/new-stack-mitchell-hashimoto-containers-no-containers-one-question-2015/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n
        \ rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"}). This means anything that is not core
        to\\n  the DataCite mission and where the service provider is better and/or\\n
        \ cheaper than what you could do internally. This evaluation can of\\n  course
        change over time\\n- collaborate with other scholarly non-profits on infrastructure,\\n
        \ including DataCite members and data centers, and other persistent\\n  identifier
        providers such as CrossRef and ORCID\\n\\n## References {#references .wp-block-heading}\\n\\nThe

        October 17, a day after the ORCID launch, DataCite started to work\\nwith
        ORCID in the European Commission-funded ORCID and DataCite\\nInteroperability
        Network [ODIN](http://odin-project.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"}, a project that has laid the groundwork for\\nthe integration
        of both the two services, and associated datasets.\\nDataCite is continuing
        work with ORCID in the follow-up project\\n[THOR](http://project-thor.eu/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} that started in June, and there will soon be\\nan exciting
        announcement about a new integration of the two services.\\n\\nThis birthday
        has a special meaning for me, as I was a member of the\\nORCID Board at the
        time, and had helped organize the launch event in\\nBerlin, as well as the
        kickoff meeting of the ODIN project, and a\\nwell-attended German-language
        event on author identification in the same\\nvenue two days before the launch,
        co-organized by\\n[DINI](https://dini.de/){target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener
        noreferrer\\\"} and\\nthe Helmholtz Association. It is really amazing how
        far we have come\\nsince then.\\n\\nThank you ORCID for all your great contributions!\\n\\nThe
