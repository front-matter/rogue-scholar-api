        science blog\\narchive reached another milestone with 15,000 ([15,332 as of\\ntoday](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave
        at least one author with ORCID ID, and 30% have at least one author\\naffiliation
        with ROR ID. [Seven\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nof
        Crossref metadata have registered references, and [one\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-funder:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nincludes
        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        last\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.53731/mh9a1-dw902){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nscience
        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,

        blogs, and with no limitations on the number of\\nblog posts that can be archived

        Board meeting last\\nmonth](https://doi.org/10.53731/9yf86-p8541){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13
        -t bibtex\\n\\n    @inbook{10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13,\\n        author
        = {Diercks, Ronald L. and Ludvigsen, Tom Clement},\\n        booktitle = {Shoulder
        Stiffness},\\n        copyright = {https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining},\\n
        \       doi = {10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13},\\n        isbn = {9783662463703},\\n
        \       month = feb,\\n        pages = {155--158},\\n        publisher = {Springer
        Science and Business Media LLC},\\n        title = {Clinical Symptoms and
        Physical Examinations},\\n        url = {https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13},\\n
        \       urldate = {2015},\\n        year = {2015}\\n    }\\n\\nThe JSON Schema
        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated
        the user interface on the Rogue Scholar website to make it\\neasier to pick
        the available metadata and content conversion formats for\\ndownload via an

        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand

        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso

        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs

        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave
        at least one author with ORCID ID, and 30% have at least one author\\naffiliation

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can

        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships
        (currently [481 blog posts with relationship\\ninformation](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-relation:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nor
        funding (currently [95 blog posts with funding\\ninformation](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-funder:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nbut
        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary
        on PyPi. The major new feature is a command-line interface for\\nall metadata
        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated

        of the\\nDataCite metadata schema. Today I released updated versions of the\\ncommonmeta
        [Ruby](https://ruby.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} and\\n[Python](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        libraries\\nthat fully support the new schema. You can install them via\\n[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/commonmeta-ruby){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nrespectively.\\n\\nDataCite
        schema 4.5 is a minor update, the first schema update since\\nschema 4.4 was
        released in March 2021 (when I was still DataCite\\nTechnical Director). The
        new version adds support for\\nresourceTypeGeneral **Instrument** and **StudyProtocol**,
        and allows an\\noptional publisher identifier in the required publisher field.\\n\\nPIDs
        for instruments have been discussed for several years, coordinated\\nby a
        dedicated [Research Data Alliance Working\\nGroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nPIDs
        for instruments make it easy to connect research outputs to the\\ninstruments
        that helped generate them in metadata, via a new relation\\ntype **Collects**/**IsCollectedBy**.\\n\\n**Publisher**
        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        (available for [40% of blog\\nposts](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nIf
        affiliation information was available in the ORCID record with start\\nand
        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),

        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no

        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue

        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar

        registered for their content, are not archived\\nvia Internet Archive, and
        can easily be removed from Rogue Scholar.\\n\\nTo enable this functionality,
        work on the Rogue Scholar backend was\\nneeded to support some of the key
        functionalities of the Rogue Scholar\\nservice for posts without DOIs and
        a long-term archiving strategy -- for\\nexample PDF downloads of full-text

        blog posts beyond the most recent (e.g.\\nthe last 10) posts. Some blogging
        platforms have APIs, or pagination in\\ntheir Atom/RSS feeds, and it is easy
        to add this functionality for open\\nsource blogging platforms such as Hugo
        or Jekyll.\\n\\nMinor issues are more common and typically revolve around
        authorship:\\n\\n- multiple authors of posts are not supported in the RSS
        feed format\\n  (and the blogging platform doesn\\\\'t support Atom feeds),\\n-
        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging
        platform. Sometimes this happens with group blogs, especially\\n  with Wordpress
        (which requires a plugin to [enable multiple\\n  co-authors](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/wordpress){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\n\\nThe

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary
        on PyPi. The major new feature is a command-line interface for\\nall metadata
        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        \       urldate = {2015},\\n        year = {2015}\\n    }\\n\\nThe JSON Schema
        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated

        accepted Science Blog bots\\nas accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing
        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        a [version 2.0 released this\\nJanuary](https://fediversereport.com/wordpress-activitypub-plugin-updates-to-v2-0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nWordpress
        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso
        had or improved fediverse support, and I hope other blogging\\nplatforms follow,
        including [Ghost](https://ghost.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nused by this
        blog.\\n\\nThese developments and the overall momentum behind fediverse adoption\\n([Threads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-your-threads-posts-will-soon-be-accessible-on-mastodon/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[Flipboard](https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nmeans
        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs
        of today the Mastodon account for the Rogue Scholar service itself\\ncan be
        found at\\n[https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar](https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nMy
        personal Mastodon account continues to be at\\n[https://mozilla.social/@martin](https://mozilla.social/@martin){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nAlso
        as of today, blogs participating in Rogue Scholar can add their\\nMastodon

        [Ruby](https://ruby.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} and\\n[Python](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        libraries\\nthat fully support the new schema. You can install them via\\n[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/commonmeta-ruby){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nrespectively.\\n\\nDataCite
        schema 4.5 is a minor update, the first schema update since\\nschema 4.4 was
        released in March 2021 (when I was still DataCite\\nTechnical Director). The
        new version adds support for\\nresourceTypeGeneral **Instrument** and **StudyProtocol**,
        and allows an\\noptional publisher identifier in the required publisher field.\\n\\nPIDs
        for instruments have been discussed for several years, coordinated\\nby a
        dedicated [Research Data Alliance Working\\nGroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nPIDs
        for instruments make it easy to connect research outputs to the\\ninstruments
        that helped generate them in metadata, via a new relation\\ntype **Collects**/**IsCollectedBy**.\\n\\n**Publisher**
        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        science blog\\narchive reached another milestone with 15,000 ([15,332 as of\\ntoday](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave
        at least one author with ORCID ID, and 30% have at least one author\\naffiliation
        with ROR ID. [Seven\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nof
        Crossref metadata have registered references, and [one\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-funder:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nincludes
        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        last\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.53731/mh9a1-dw902){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nscience
        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated
        the user interface on the Rogue Scholar website to make it\\neasier to pick

        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand

        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso

        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs

        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can

        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary
        on PyPi. The major new feature is a command-line interface for\\nall metadata
        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated
        the user interface on the Rogue Scholar website to make it\\neasier to pick

        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved

        of the\\nDataCite metadata schema. Today I released updated versions of the\\ncommonmeta
        [Ruby](https://ruby.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} and\\n[Python](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        libraries\\nthat fully support the new schema. You can install them via\\n[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/commonmeta-ruby){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nrespectively.\\n\\nDataCite
        schema 4.5 is a minor update, the first schema update since\\nschema 4.4 was
        released in March 2021 (when I was still DataCite\\nTechnical Director). The
        new version adds support for\\nresourceTypeGeneral **Instrument** and **StudyProtocol**,
        and allows an\\noptional publisher identifier in the required publisher field.\\n\\nPIDs
        for instruments have been discussed for several years, coordinated\\nby a
        dedicated [Research Data Alliance Working\\nGroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nPIDs
        for instruments make it easy to connect research outputs to the\\ninstruments
        that helped generate them in metadata, via a new relation\\ntype **Collects**/**IsCollectedBy**.\\n\\n**Publisher**
        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        (available for [40% of blog\\nposts](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nIf
        affiliation information was available in the ORCID record with start\\nand
        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having

        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar

        status don\\\\'t show up in the production\\nservice, don\\\\'t have DOIs
        registered for their content, are not archived\\nvia Internet Archive, and
        can easily be removed from Rogue Scholar.\\n\\nTo enable this functionality,
        work on the Rogue Scholar backend was\\nneeded to support some of the key
        functionalities of the Rogue Scholar\\nservice for posts without DOIs and
        a long-term archiving strategy -- for\\nexample PDF downloads of full-text
        content and generation of formatted\\ncitations.\\n\\nTwo science blogs are
        currently included in Rogue Scholar Preview. All\\nposts have a *Pending*
        tag, no DOI, but otherwise look similar to\\nregular Rogue Scholar posts:\\n\\n<figure

        blog posts beyond the most recent (e.g.\\nthe last 10) posts. Some blogging
        platforms have APIs, or pagination in\\ntheir Atom/RSS feeds, and it is easy
        to add this functionality for open\\nsource blogging platforms such as Hugo
        or Jekyll.\\n\\nMinor issues are more common and typically revolve around
        authorship:\\n\\n- multiple authors of posts are not supported in the RSS
        feed format\\n  (and the blogging platform doesn\\\\'t support Atom feeds),\\n-
        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging
        platform. Sometimes this happens with group blogs, especially\\n  with Wordpress
        (which requires a plugin to [enable multiple\\n  co-authors](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/wordpress){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\n\\nThe
        new Rogue Scholar Preview service further simplifies full-text\\nsearch, DOI
        registration, and archiving for science blogs and\\ndemonstrates that scholarly

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary

        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated

        Rogue Scholar, and what it means for science blogs participating in\\nRogue
        Scholar.\\n\\n> The fediverse is a collection of community-owned, ad-free,\\n>

        August\_I launched a Mastodon instance at\_[Rogue Scholar\\nSocial](https://rogue-scholar.social/)\_that
        accepted Science Blog bots\\nas accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing
        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        a [version 2.0 released this\\nJanuary](https://fediversereport.com/wordpress-activitypub-plugin-updates-to-v2-0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nWordpress
        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso
        had or improved fediverse support, and I hope other blogging\\nplatforms follow,
        including [Ghost](https://ghost.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nused by this
        blog.\\n\\nThese developments and the overall momentum behind fediverse adoption\\n([Threads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-your-threads-posts-will-soon-be-accessible-on-mastodon/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[Flipboard](https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nmeans
        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs
        of today the Mastodon account for the Rogue Scholar service itself\\ncan be
        found at\\n[https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar](https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nMy
        personal Mastodon account continues to be at\\n[https://mozilla.social/@martin](https://mozilla.social/@martin){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nAlso
        as of today, blogs participating in Rogue Scholar can add their\\nMastodon

        of the\\nDataCite metadata schema. Today I released updated versions of the\\ncommonmeta
        [Ruby](https://ruby.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"} and\\n[Python](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nrespectively.\\n\\nDataCite
        schema 4.5 is a minor update, the first schema update since\\nschema 4.4 was
        released in March 2021 (when I was still DataCite\\nTechnical Director). The
        new version adds support for\\nresourceTypeGeneral **Instrument** and **StudyProtocol**,
        and allows an\\noptional publisher identifier in the required publisher field.\\n\\nPIDs
        for instruments have been discussed for several years, coordinated\\nby a
        dedicated [Research Data Alliance Working\\nGroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nPIDs
        for instruments make it easy to connect research outputs to the\\ninstruments
        that helped generate them in metadata, via a new relation\\ntype **Collects**/**IsCollectedBy**.\\n\\n**Publisher**
        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous
        integration, but are not the best fit for very frequent\\nbackground jobs.\\n\\nYou
        can see *commonmeta-py* at work generating DataCite or Crossref\\nmetadata
        on the fly via the Rogue Scholar API using the following links\\n([Crossref](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=crossref_xml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[DataCite](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.59350/3jb9h-jcd77?format=datacite){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nfor
        the 2020 blog post by Henry Rzepa mentioned earlier. Similar links\\nwork
        for all Rogue Scholar blog post DOIs. The publisher metadata of\\nthese DataCite
        DOIs don\\\\'t include a publisher identifier yet, as this\\ninformation has
        not been systematically collected for Rogue Scholar\\nblogs, and/or ROR identifiers
        are not (yet) available for single-person\\norganizations such as Front Matter.

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        Archive -- for a one-time fee of \\\\$150.\\n\\nAs discussed in a [blog post
        last\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.53731/mh9a1-dw902){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nscience
        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated
        the user interface on the Rogue Scholar website to make it\\neasier to pick
        the available metadata and content conversion formats for\\ndownload via an

        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand

        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso

        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best

        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nrespectively.\\n\\nDataCite
        schema 4.5 is a minor update, the first schema update since\\nschema 4.4 was

        and allows an\\noptional publisher identifier in the required publisher field.\\n\\nPIDs
        for instruments have been discussed for several years, coordinated\\nby a
        dedicated [Research Data Alliance Working\\nGroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/persistent-identification-instruments-wg){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nPIDs
        for instruments make it easy to connect research outputs to the\\ninstruments

        is a required DataCite metadata field since the launch of\\nDataCite. With
        schema 4.5 this property can now include an optional\\nidentifier, typically
        a Research Organization Registry\\n([ROR](https://ror.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        ID. This will make it easier\\nto find all scholarly resources with DataCite
        DOIs published by a\\nparticular publisher.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://www.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is a\\nmetadata standard for scholarly metadata that I [launched in early\\n2023](https://doi.org/10.53731/cp7apdj-jk5f471){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nCurrently
        implemented via open source libraries for the Ruby and Python\\nlanguages,
        commonmeta allows easy conversion between common scholarly\\nmetadata formats,
        including Crossref and DataCite metadata, BibTex, RIS,\\nSchema.org, and formatted
        citations in any of the available 1000s of\\ncitation styles.\\n\\nWhile this
        is a minor update to the *commonmeta-ruby* library\\n(commonmeta already supported
        publisher identifiers and the Instrument\\nresource type), the changes for
        *commonmeta-py* are bigger, as I am\\nworking towards a version 1.0 release
        in the next few months. The main\\ndriver at the moment is DOI registrations
        for science blog posts\\nincluded in the [Rogue Scholar science blog\\narchive](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and I want to\\nmigrate the current workflow using GitHub Actions and *commonmeta-ruby*\\nto
        background workers in the Rogue Scholar API written with\\n*commonmeta-py*.
        The [main\\nreason](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the\\nperformance bottleneck using GitHub Actions, which work great for\\ncontinuous

        of today. As RSS feeds -- which Rogue Scholar uses to fetch content\\nand
        metadata -- have not standardized how metadata for references should\\nbe
        described, Rogue Scholar is extracting them from the full text of\\nposts
        and takes advantage of the fact that there is a standard format: a\\nsection
        called **References** followed by a listing of metadata (author,\\ntitle,
        publication year, etc.) that includes a DOI or URL link.\\n[Crossref Directory

        style=\\\"white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">Image by Geoff\\nBilder</span></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAn
        example is the references in this post. The citation style (in this\\ncase
        **APA**) doesn\\\\'t matter as Rogue Scholar only looks for the links.\\nIf
        the link is a DOI, the Rogue Scholar looks up the DOI metadata via\\nDOI content
        negotiation and stores DOI, title, and publication year.\\nThis information
        is then included in the metadata registered with\\nCrossref.\\n\\n### Improvements
        to the references workflow\\n\\nIn the past few weeks I have started to improve
        this workflow. The first\\nstep was to store all references in the Rogue Scholar
        API, using a new\\n[/works](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/works){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        API\\nendpoint, and the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nJSON
        schema. Commonmeta-py can import metadata in Crossref and DataCite\\nformats,
        and the latest version has improved support for extracting\\nmetadata from
        web pages using schema.org and HTML meta tags. This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to find DOI metadata for webpages, e.g. journal article\\nlanding pages (similar
        to what Zotero and other reference managers are\\ndoing), and to store additional
        metadata about web links, mainly the\\ntitle and publication year. This information
        is now included in the\\nreferences registered with Crossref.\\n\\nTo show
        the references that Rogue Scholar has found for a blog post, I\\nchanged the
        layout of Rogue Scholar pages which now include pages for\\nindividual posts,
        e.g. [this\\npage](https://rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure

        a Rogue Scholar\\nsearch result. Going forward these dedicated pages will
        show more\\nmetadata, e.g. funding and relationship information.\\n\\nThe
        next step is adding the ability to display the references in a\\nvariety of
        citation styles and export them in formats such as BibTex or\\nCSL, both straightforward
        as these are core functionalities of the\\ncommonmeta-py library.\\n\\nBy
        showing the references in Rogue Scholar I hope to motivate blog\\nauthors
        to include more references in their posts, and I will continue\\nto work with
        them on how to improve reference parsing, e.g. when\\nreferences don\\\\'t
        include a DOI or URL link. I am a big supporter of the\\nInitiative for Open
        Citations\\n([I4OC](https://doi.org/10.59350/jdwj8-at997){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        and\\nhelped get it started. In the case of Rogue Scholar, the challenge is\\nnot
        opening up existing but closed reference metadata, but finding ways\\nto collect
        and register them with Crossref that scale for science blogs.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner,

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support

        (available for [40% of blog\\nposts](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nIf
        affiliation information was available in the ORCID record with start\\nand
        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),

        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having

        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue

        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar

        Preview**. This new functionality enables the import of\\nnew science blogs

        allows users to see how their blog posts will look like in the\\nRogue Scholar
        service, and to resolve issues if necessary. Until\\napproved, blogs in preview
        status don\\\\'t show up in the production\\nservice, don\\\\'t have DOIs
        registered for their content, are not archived\\nvia Internet Archive, and
        can easily be removed from Rogue Scholar.\\n\\nTo enable this functionality,
        work on the Rogue Scholar backend was\\nneeded to support some of the key
        functionalities of the Rogue Scholar\\nservice for posts without DOIs and
        a long-term archiving strategy -- for\\nexample PDF downloads of full-text
        content and generation of formatted\\ncitations.\\n\\nTwo science blogs are
        currently included in Rogue Scholar Preview. All\\nposts have a *Pending*
        tag, no DOI, but otherwise look similar to\\nregular Rogue Scholar posts:\\n\\n<figure

        blog posts beyond the most recent (e.g.\\nthe last 10) posts. Some blogging
        platforms have APIs, or pagination in\\ntheir Atom/RSS feeds, and it is easy
        to add this functionality for open\\nsource blogging platforms such as Hugo
        or Jekyll.\\n\\nMinor issues are more common and typically revolve around
        authorship:\\n\\n- multiple authors of posts are not supported in the RSS
        feed format\\n  (and the blogging platform doesn\\\\'t support Atom feeds),\\n-
        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging
        platform. Sometimes this happens with group blogs, especially\\n  with Wordpress
        (which requires a plugin to [enable multiple\\n  co-authors](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/wordpress){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\n\\nThe
        new Rogue Scholar Preview service further simplifies full-text\\nsearch, DOI
        registration, and archiving for science blogs and\\ndemonstrates that scholarly

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary

        conversions, and the metadata validation with the\\nCommonmeta [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated

        accepted Science Blog bots\\nas accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing
        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        a [version 2.0 released this\\nJanuary](https://fediversereport.com/wordpress-activitypub-plugin-updates-to-v2-0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nWordpress
        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso
        had or improved fediverse support, and I hope other blogging\\nplatforms follow,
        including [Ghost](https://ghost.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nused by this
        blog.\\n\\nThese developments and the overall momentum behind fediverse adoption\\n([Threads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-your-threads-posts-will-soon-be-accessible-on-mastodon/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[Flipboard](https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nmeans
        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs
        of today the Mastodon account for the Rogue Scholar service itself\\ncan be
        found at\\n[https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar](https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nMy
        personal Mastodon account continues to be at\\n[https://mozilla.social/@martin](https://mozilla.social/@martin){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nAlso

        and takes advantage of the fact that there is a standard format: a\\nsection
        called **References** followed by a listing of metadata (author,\\ntitle,
        publication year, etc.) that includes a DOI or URL link.\\n[Crossref Directory

        style=\\\"white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">Image by Geoff\\nBilder</span></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAn
        example is the references in this post. The citation style (in this\\ncase
        **APA**) doesn\\\\'t matter as Rogue Scholar only looks for the links.\\nIf
        the link is a DOI, the Rogue Scholar looks up the DOI metadata via\\nDOI content
        negotiation and stores DOI, title, and publication year.\\nThis information
        is then included in the metadata registered with\\nCrossref.\\n\\n### Improvements
        to the references workflow\\n\\nIn the past few weeks I have started to improve
        this workflow. The first\\nstep was to store all references in the Rogue Scholar
        API, using a new\\n[/works](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/works){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        API\\nendpoint, and the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nJSON
        schema. Commonmeta-py can import metadata in Crossref and DataCite\\nformats,
        and the latest version has improved support for extracting\\nmetadata from
        web pages using schema.org and HTML meta tags. This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to find DOI metadata for webpages, e.g. journal article\\nlanding pages (similar
        to what Zotero and other reference managers are\\ndoing), and to store additional
        metadata about web links, mainly the\\ntitle and publication year. This information
        is now included in the\\nreferences registered with Crossref.\\n\\nTo show
        the references that Rogue Scholar has found for a blog post, I\\nchanged the
        layout of Rogue Scholar pages which now include pages for\\nindividual posts,
        e.g. [this\\npage](https://rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure

        a Rogue Scholar\\nsearch result. Going forward these dedicated pages will
        show more\\nmetadata, e.g. funding and relationship information.\\n\\nThe
        next step is adding the ability to display the references in a\\nvariety of
        citation styles and export them in formats such as BibTex or\\nCSL, both straightforward
        as these are core functionalities of the\\ncommonmeta-py library.\\n\\nBy
        showing the references in Rogue Scholar I hope to motivate blog\\nauthors
        to include more references in their posts, and I will continue\\nto work with
        them on how to improve reference parsing, e.g. when\\nreferences don\\\\'t
        include a DOI or URL link. I am a big supporter of the\\nInitiative for Open
        Citations\\n([I4OC](https://doi.org/10.59350/jdwj8-at997){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        and\\nhelped get it started. In the case of Rogue Scholar, the challenge is\\nnot
        opening up existing but closed reference metadata, but finding ways\\nto collect
        and register them with Crossref that scale for science blogs.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner,

        science blog\\narchive reached another milestone with 15,000 ([15,332 as of\\ntoday](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave
        at least one author with ORCID ID, and 30% have at least one author\\naffiliation
        with ROR ID. [Seven\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nof
        Crossref metadata have registered references, and [one\\npercent](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-funder:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nincludes
        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        last\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.53731/mh9a1-dw902){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nscience
        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can
        pay for\\nmore than one project), or any third party that wants to support
        project\\nblogs. Please reach out to [Front Matter\\nsupport](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated
        the user interface on the Rogue Scholar website to make it\\neasier to pick
        the available metadata and content conversion formats for\\ndownload via an

        accepted Science Blog bots\\nas accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing
        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        a [version 2.0 released this\\nJanuary](https://fediversereport.com/wordpress-activitypub-plugin-updates-to-v2-0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nWordpress
        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso
        had or improved fediverse support, and I hope other blogging\\nplatforms follow,
        including [Ghost](https://ghost.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nused by this
        blog.\\n\\nThese developments and the overall momentum behind fediverse adoption\\n([Threads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-your-threads-posts-will-soon-be-accessible-on-mastodon/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\n[Flipboard](https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nmeans
        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs

        found at\\n[https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar](https://wisskomm.social/@rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nMy

        and has\\nregistered Crossref DOIs for [1,114 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nas
        of today. As RSS feeds -- which Rogue Scholar uses to fetch content\\nand
        metadata -- have not standardized how metadata for references should\\nbe
        described, Rogue Scholar is extracting them from the full text of\\nposts
        and takes advantage of the fact that there is a standard format: a\\nsection
        called **References** followed by a listing of metadata (author,\\ntitle,
        publication year, etc.) that includes a DOI or URL link.\\n[Crossref Directory
        of Technology Geoff\\nBilder](https://www.crossref.org/people/geoffrey-bilder/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nuses
        this image in presentations to make a similar point -- scholarly\\naudiences
        immediately understand how the references section of a\\npublication looks:\\n\\n<figure
        class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://blog.front-matter.io/content/images/2024/03/article2-1-1.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"kg-image\\\"

        style=\\\"white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">Image by Geoff\\nBilder</span></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAn
        example is the references in this post. The citation style (in this\\ncase
        **APA**) doesn\\\\'t matter as Rogue Scholar only looks for the links.\\nIf
        the link is a DOI, the Rogue Scholar looks up the DOI metadata via\\nDOI content
        negotiation and stores DOI, title, and publication year.\\nThis information
        is then included in the metadata registered with\\nCrossref.\\n\\n### Improvements
        to the references workflow\\n\\nIn the past few weeks I have started to improve
        this workflow. The first\\nstep was to store all references in the Rogue Scholar
        API, using a new\\n[/works](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/works){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        API\\nendpoint, and the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nJSON
        schema. Commonmeta-py can import metadata in Crossref and DataCite\\nformats,
        and the latest version has improved support for extracting\\nmetadata from
        web pages using schema.org and HTML meta tags. This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to find DOI metadata for webpages, e.g. journal article\\nlanding pages (similar
        to what Zotero and other reference managers are\\ndoing), and to store additional
        metadata about web links, mainly the\\ntitle and publication year. This information
        is now included in the\\nreferences registered with Crossref.\\n\\nTo show
        the references that Rogue Scholar has found for a blog post, I\\nchanged the
        layout of Rogue Scholar pages which now include pages for\\nindividual posts,
        e.g. [this\\npage](https://rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure

        />\\n</figure>\\n\\nYou navigate to these pages by clicking on the title in
        a Rogue Scholar\\nsearch result. Going forward these dedicated pages will
        show more\\nmetadata, e.g. funding and relationship information.\\n\\nThe
        next step is adding the ability to display the references in a\\nvariety of
        citation styles and export them in formats such as BibTex or\\nCSL, both straightforward
        as these are core functionalities of the\\ncommonmeta-py library.\\n\\nBy
        showing the references in Rogue Scholar I hope to motivate blog\\nauthors
        to include more references in their posts, and I will continue\\nto work with
        them on how to improve reference parsing, e.g. when\\nreferences don\\\\'t
        include a DOI or URL link. I am a big supporter of the\\nInitiative for Open
        Citations\\n([I4OC](https://doi.org/10.59350/jdwj8-at997){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        and\\nhelped get it started. In the case of Rogue Scholar, the challenge is\\nnot
        opening up existing but closed reference metadata, but finding ways\\nto collect
        and register them with Crossref that scale for science blogs.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner,

        science blog\\narchive reached another milestone with 15,000 ([15,332 as of\\ntoday](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/posts){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and\\n28% in German. The most common subject areas are Law with 22%, Computer\\nand
        Information Sciences with 20% and Earth and related Environmental\\nSciences
        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave
        at least one author with ORCID ID, and 30% have at least one author\\naffiliation

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof
        \\\\$150 and is good for all project blog posts made during the project\\n(for
        up to five years). The project should ideally sign up with the\\nProject plan
        at the beginning of the project to allow tracking of usage\\nstats, but not
        after the project blog no longer has a publicly available\\nRSS feed and website.
        Payment is via the [Ko-fi\\nservice](https://ko-fi.com/s/a299717a07){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        and can be\\nmade by the project, the funder (so that interested funders can

        its 15K blog posts registered with Crossref. This makes Front Matter\\n(the
        Crossref member registering Rogue Scholar DOIs) one of the [top 10\\nROR early
        adopters in Crossref\\nmetadata](http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-ror-id:t&facet=publisher-name:*){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nAuthor
        affiliations were implemented using the ORCID metadata of blog\\npost authors
        (available for [40% of blog\\nposts](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nIf
        affiliation information was available in the ORCID record with start\\nand
        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having
        [discontinued support for\\n  Ringgold\\n  IDs](https://info.orcid.org/orcid-support-for-ringgold-organization-ids-ending/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships
        (currently [481 blog posts with relationship\\ninformation](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-relation:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nor
        funding (currently [95 blog posts with funding\\ninformation](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-funder:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nbut
        Rogue Scholar is demonstrating that persistent identifiers (DOI,\\nORCID,
        ROR) and relevant metadata for blog posts is feasible,\\naffordable, and works
        at scale with 15K blog posts registered to date.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.53731/bxk5g-pxw97\",\"guid\":\"65e6e0302b5139000132faf4\",\"id\":\"4e7c3c96-cfdb-4aa8-b1e6-98cf10d31dd8\",\"image\":\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1644144974794-2942d75086a0?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE3fHxtdXNldW0lMjBvdXRzaWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcwOTYyOTU5MXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1709633272,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"This

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        week the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        Python\\nlibrary adds an important new feature: metadata lists. With this
        feature\\ncommonmeta-py no longer only operates on metadata for a single scholarly\\nwork
        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists
        of works from ORCID records.\\n\\nThis new feature also enhances the Rogue
        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).
        Registration of new content in batches\\nis not implemented yet, as it involves
        additional logic of generating a\\nrandom DOI string for every new content
        item.\\n\\nCommonmeta-py can be [installed via\\nPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and can\\nbe [found on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nThe

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##

        I released version 0.13 of the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://pypi.org/project/commonmeta-py/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary

        has\\nfinally been fixed.\\n\\nThe command-line interface takes any supported
        persistent identifier or\\nfile as input, and returns the metadata in the
        desired format as output.\\nFor example a book chapter with a Crossref DOI
        formatted as BibTex:\\n\\n    poetry run commonmeta convert 10.1007/978-3-662-46370-3_13

        validation optionally raises an error if metadata are\\nmissing or in the
        wrong format\\n\\n``` `\\npoetry run commonmeta convert 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030277.g001
        -t datacite --show-errors\\n\\nError: 'contributors' is a required property\\n```\\n\\nIn
        this example the Crossref DOI for a component (a figure from a PLOS\\npaper)
        has no contributor, not needed for Crossref components but\\nrequired by the
        [Commonmeta JSON\\nSchema](https://www.commonmeta.org/schema){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        and also\\nfor all DataCite DOIs (the format we try to convert to).\\n\\nWith
        this release commonmeta-py has reached feature parity with the\\n[commonmeta-ruby](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.10615938){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nlibrary,
        which I started working on seven years ago under the original\\nname [bolognese](https://doi.org/10.5438/N138-Z3MK){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nbut
        later added important features such as JSON Schema validation and\\nCrossref
        XML generation.\\n\\nWith these new functionalities, I was able to switch
        DOI registration\\nfor the Rogue Scholar science blog archive to use the commonmeta-py\\nlibrary.
        At this time using a GitHub Action, but in the future directly\\nbuilt into
        the [Rogue Scholar\\nAPI](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar-api){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nSo
        far I have registered or updated a few dozen DOIs with commonmeta-py\\nin
        production. With many more DOIs registered in the coming months, I\\nhope
        to discover issues with the library that are only discovered with a\\nlarge
        sample size. I would also like to start supporting DOI\\nregistration for
        science blogs that use DataCite DOIs (currently two\\nblogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar). And before I can release version\\n1.0, the\\n[documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        has to\\nbe greatly improved.\\n\\nIn addition to Rogue Scholar DOI registrations,
        commonmeta-py is also\\nused to convert metadata into other formats, [overcoming
        some\\nlimitations](https://doi.org/10.53731/n4vfp-nwb08){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        of\\nDOI content negotiation offered by Crossref and DataCite. Today I\\nupdated

        accepted Science Blog bots\\nas accounts, (semi-)automatically publishing
        summaries of blog posts via\\nRogue Scholar. The idea was to help increase
        the visibility of\\nparticipating science blogs and foster a discussion around
        interesting\\nblog posts.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that many
        science blogs or bloggers\\nalready had a presence in the fediverse, or preferred
        a human over a\\nbot. In the following months, the [Wordpress ActivityPub\\nPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nevolved
        with [support in all Wordpress.com plans in\\nOctober](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913278/wordpress-activitypub-official-plugin-automattic-fediverse-mastodon){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nand
        a [version 2.0 released this\\nJanuary](https://fediversereport.com/wordpress-activitypub-plugin-updates-to-v2-0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\nWordpress
        is the most common blogging platform on Rogue Scholar with\\ncurrently [40%
        of\\nparticipating](https://rogue-scholar.org/de/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nblogs
        using it. Other blogging platforms (e.g.\\n[Write.as](https://howto.write.as/enabling-federation){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nor\\n[micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/make-micro-blog-a-full-citizen-of-the-mastodon-universe/2138){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nalso
        had or improved fediverse support, and I hope other blogging\\nplatforms follow,
        including [Ghost](https://ghost.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nused by this

        that going forward federation via the ActivityPub protocol is\\nprobably best
        done by the blogs themselves, rather than Rogue Scholar.\\nFor these reasons,
        I will retire the Rogue Scholar [Mastodon\\nserver](https://rogue-scholar.social){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        on March 31 and\\nwill help migrate accounts to other fediverse instances.\\n\\nAs

        the start last year one important goal for the [Rogue\\nScholar](https://rogue-scholar.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        science blog\\narchive was to make it easy to use for blog authors and readers.
        Today I\\nwant to focus on another aspect: keep it simple to run Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure.
        To address that goal I started development work last\\nweek to further simplify
        one important aspect of Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure: metadata conversion.\\n\\n[Commonmeta](https://commonmeta.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        is the metadata\\nformat that Rogue Scholar uses internally to generate Crossref
        metadata\\nfor DOI registration and to display Rogue Scholar blog posts in
        several\\npopular metadata formats (BibTex, RIS, Schema.org, formatted citations,\\netc.).
        Last September I\\n[updated](https://doi.org/10.53731/xszpd-6z265){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        the\\ncommonmeta-py library to provide a command-line interface and enable\\nCrossref
        DOI registration. In October I launched the [Rogue Scholar\\nPython API](https://doi.org/10.53731/ar11b-5ea39){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        to\\nprovide these metadata conversions to Rogue Scholar, including Crossref\\nDOI
        registrations, using the commonmeta-py library. In the last few\\nmonths,
        I have continuously improved commonmeta-py, e.g. by better\\n[metadata\\ndetection](Fenner,%20M.%20(2024,%20March%2027).%20Tracking%20references%20of%20Rogue%20Scholar%20blog%20posts.%20Front%20Matter.%20https://doi.org/10.53731/j77gv-54g66){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nof
        Rogue Scholar references:\\n\\n- Detect references to content with DOIs, e.g.
        journal article landing\\n  pages (e.g.\\n  [https://app.pan.pl/article/item/app011052023.html](https://commonmeta.org/10.4202/app.01105.2023/transform/application/vnd.commonmeta+json){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\n-
        Extract metadata for references to web pages (e.g.\\n  [https://blog.scholarled.org/on-the-meaning-of-scholar-led](https://commonmeta.org/blog.scholarled.org/on-the-meaning-of-scholar-led/transform/application/vnd.commonmeta+json){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\n-
        Extract basic metadata for references to PDF files (e.g.\\n  [https://docentes.fct.unl.pt/sites/default/files/omateus/files/tschopp_mateus_2016\\\\_-\\\\_case_3700\\\\_-\\\\_diplodocus_type.pdf](https://commonmeta.org/docentes.fct.unl.pt/sites/default/files/omateus/files/tschopp_mateus_2016_-_case_3700_-_diplodocus_type.pdf/transform/application/vnd.commonmeta+json){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\n\\nLast
        week I started work on\\n[commonmeta-go](https://github.com/commonmeta/commonmeta-go){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nan
        implementation of the commonmeta metadata conversion written in the\\nGo language.
        I plan to make the first public release by June. Many\\ncritical components
        of scholar infrastructure are written in Go, and\\nthis library will allow
        me to streamline the Rogue Scholar metadata\\nconversion and DOI registration
        by bringing commonmeta functionality\\ncloser to the Rogue Scholar database
        instead of maintaining a dedicated\\nPython API for this functionality.\\n\\nPlease
        [reach out to me](mailto:info@front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nif
        you are interested in the details of my thinking, e.g. why I picked\\nGo and
        not another language, why not Javascript, Python, or Ruby ([the\\nother commonmeta\\nimplementation](https://doi.org/10.53731/fawv321-14359c4){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nor
        how this work will integrate with the other parts of the Rogue\\nScholar technology
        stack, e.g. database (Postgres), search index\\n([Typesense](https://typesense.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),
        and content\\nconversion ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\n\\nWriting
        commonmeta-go is a significant investment in time but will help\\nme develop
        and maintain Rogue Scholar in the long run. I also see the\\nneed for simplified
        scholarly metadata conversion beyond science blogs\\nand Rogue Scholar, see
        the current discussion of Diamond Open Access\\ne.g. in Rogue Scholar blog
        posts ([Gutknecht\\n2024](https://doi.org/10.59350/za28t-6j546){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},

        described, Rogue Scholar is extracting them from the full text of\\nposts
        and takes advantage of the fact that there is a standard format: a\\nsection
        called **References** followed by a listing of metadata (author,\\ntitle,

        style=\\\"white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">Image by Geoff\\nBilder</span></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAn
        example is the references in this post. The citation style (in this\\ncase
        **APA**) doesn\\\\'t matter as Rogue Scholar only looks for the links.\\nIf
        the link is a DOI, the Rogue Scholar looks up the DOI metadata via\\nDOI content
        negotiation and stores DOI, title, and publication year.\\nThis information
        is then included in the metadata registered with\\nCrossref.\\n\\n### Improvements
        to the references workflow\\n\\nIn the past few weeks I have started to improve
        this workflow. The first\\nstep was to store all references in the Rogue Scholar
        API, using a new\\n[/works](https://api.rogue-scholar.org/works){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        API\\nendpoint, and the\\n[commonmeta-py](https://doi.org/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nJSON
        schema. Commonmeta-py can import metadata in Crossref and DataCite\\nformats,
        and the latest version has improved support for extracting\\nmetadata from
        web pages using schema.org and HTML meta tags. This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to find DOI metadata for webpages, e.g. journal article\\nlanding pages (similar
        to what Zotero and other reference managers are\\ndoing), and to store additional
        metadata about web links, mainly the\\ntitle and publication year. This information
        is now included in the\\nreferences registered with Crossref.\\n\\nTo show
        the references that Rogue Scholar has found for a blog post, I\\nchanged the
        layout of Rogue Scholar pages which now include pages for\\nindividual posts,
        e.g. [this\\npage](https://rogue-scholar.org/posts/10.53731/b8j4w-zpk40){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}:\\n\\n<figure

        a Rogue Scholar\\nsearch result. Going forward these dedicated pages will
        show more\\nmetadata, e.g. funding and relationship information.\\n\\nThe
        next step is adding the ability to display the references in a\\nvariety of
        citation styles and export them in formats such as BibTex or\\nCSL, both straightforward
        as these are core functionalities of the\\ncommonmeta-py library.\\n\\nBy
        showing the references in Rogue Scholar I hope to motivate blog\\nauthors
        to include more references in their posts, and I will continue\\nto work with
        them on how to improve reference parsing, e.g. when\\nreferences don\\\\'t
        include a DOI or URL link. I am a big supporter of the\\nInitiative for Open
        Citations\\n([I4OC](https://doi.org/10.59350/jdwj8-at997){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})
        and\\nhelped get it started. In the case of Rogue Scholar, the challenge is\\nnot
        opening up existing but closed reference metadata, but finding ways\\nto collect
        and register them with Crossref that scale for science blogs.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner,

        science\\nblog posts. These posts come from 86 participating blogs with [69%\\nwritten
        in\\nEnglish](https://rogue-scholar.org/about#stats){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}

        with 12%. Wordpress is the dominating blogging platform with\\n46% of posts
        on self-hosted Wordpress blogs, and 23% of posts hosted by\\nWordpress.com.
        Overall blogs participating in Rogue Scholar are using 10\\ndifferent blogging
        platforms.\\n\\nThree blogs register DOIs with DataCite, and the rest register
        DOIs with\\nCrossref via Rogue Scholar. The metadata registered with Crossref\\nincludes
        abstract, language, license information, and links to full-text\\nversions
        in all cases. [Fifty\\npercent](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nhave

        funding information.\\n\\nWhen Rogue Scholar started in April 2023 I would
        not have imagined this\\nlevel of adoption, so I am of course very excited.
        Going forward I will\\ninvest more time into improving the metadata quality,
        and you can expect\\nan announcement about references very soon. The top priority
        is easy\\nmetadata registration for blog authors, but that does not mean that\\nscience
        blog metadata need to be sparse and incomplete.\\n\\nThe other area where
        more work is needed is financial support. The\\ncontent from all blogs participating
        in Rogue Scholar is free to read\\nand reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\nlicense.
        I am very reluctant to charge authors, but ask for a one-time\\nfee of \\\\$1
        per post beyond 50 posts per year (this mostly affects blogs\\nrunning for
        many years). With the help of donations and my waiving this\\n\\\\$1 per post
        fee in many cases, I was able to archive all blog posts\\nfrom participating
        blogs in the last few months. In February I started a\\n[Personal plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/bdrgt-cjh09){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nthat
        is completely free for personal blogs. Last week I announced a\\n[Project
        plan](https://doi.org/10.53731/2kkkq-p4h51){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\nfor
        blogs of grant-funded projects and hope that some funders and\\nproject blogs
        are interested in that option.\\n\\nThe costs for running Rogue Scholar have
        remained very reasonable with\\ncurrently not more than \\\\$300 per month,
        the largest percentage being\\nDOI registration (Crossref) and long-term archiving
        (Internet Archive).\\nBy far the largest cost factor is staff time for development
        work,\\nsupport, and outreach. Donations to Rogue Scholar are always welcomed,\\nand
        the easiest way is via one-time or monthly [Ko-fi\\ndonations](https://ko-fi.com/rogue_scholar){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\n##

        blogs from grant-funded projects have particular needs:\\n\\n- Grant-funded
        projects have a strong desire to communicate their\\n  outputs and activities,
        and science blogs are an established and\\n  popular format to do that,\\n-
        Funders want grant-funded projects to demonstrate the impact of these\\n  outreach
        activities in terms of views, citations, and social media\\n  metrics,\\n-
        Because of the time-limited funding and staffing blogs from\\n  grant-funded
        projects run a particularly high risk of disappearing\\n  from the public
        web and thus the scholarly record.\\n\\nRogue Scholar can help grant-funded
        projects to address these needs. All\\nposts from participating blogs are
        archived in Rogue Scholar\\ninfrastructure and the Internet Archive\\n[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service when\\nblogs for grant-funded projects are no longer maintained (and
        the DOIs\\nof blog posts will redirect to the archived versions). The Rogue
        Scholar\\nfull-text search makes the discovery of relevant content much easier,\\nand
        the DOIs with rich metadata allow grantees and funders to see all\\nblog posts
        funded by a particular grant or funder. The [blog of the THOR\\nproject](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/thor){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\ndemonstrates
        how that works, including [all outputs funded by the\\nproject grant in the
        Crossref REST\\nAPI](https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=award.number:654039){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nand
        the [archived versions in\\nArchive-It](https://archive-it.org/collections/22143){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}.\\n\\nThe
        **Project** plan adds two new functionalities to Rogue Scholar:\\n\\n- Usage
        stats for all blog posts via the\\n  [Plausible](https://plausible.io/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        service, a\\n  privacy-friendly Google Analytics alternative included with
        all\\n  Project plans. The\\n  [Upstream](https://plausible.io/upstream.force11.org){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog as well as\\n  [this](https://plausible.io/blog.front-matter.io){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ blog have used the Plausible service for more than two years and have\\n
        \ made the usage stats available to everybody.\\n- Citation counts for all
        blog posts via the Crossref\\n  [cited-by](https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n
        \ service are also included with all Project plans. Integration into\\n  Rogue
        Scholar will launch in June for the first anniversary of the\\n  Rogue Scholar
        launch. As with usage stats, citations will be made\\n  available to all users
        without requiring payment or authentication.\\n\\nBecause of the rapidly changing
        landscape of social media platforms (X,\\nMastodon, Bluesky, Threads, etc.)
        Rogue Scholar is not offering any\\nsocial media metrics at this time.\\n\\nTo
        simplify payment for the Project plan, the plan costs a one-time fee\\nof

        (available for [40% of blog\\nposts](https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/31795){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\nIf
        affiliation information was available in the ORCID record with start\\nand
        end dates, and unless multiple affiliations existed in parallel, the\\nblog
        post publication date then was used to retrieve the corresponding\\naffiliation
        information.\\n\\nThis is an early implementation but several issues need
        to be resolved\\ngoing forward:\\n\\n- blog posts authors might not want to
        provide their ORCID ID or\\n  affiliation,\\n- The ORCID record contains no
        affiliation information (in the\\n  **Employment** or **Education** sections),
        or there are no start and\\n  end dates,\\n- Some ORCID records still contain
        Ringgold institutional identifiers\\n  instead of ROR IDs, despite ORCID having

        \ in August 2023,\\n- Some affiliations of Rogue Scholar authors have [no
        ROR ID for various\\n  reasons](https://ror.org/about/faqs/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},
        including\\n  Front Matter because it is currently a single-person organization,\\n-
        the affiliation lookup via ORCID can be further automated,\\n- the affiliation
        information is currently only shown in Rogue Scholar\\n  API, but not in the
        web frontend.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks and months I will work with Rogue Scholar
        blog post\\nauthors to provide their ORCID ID (this is of course optional,
        but\\nsupported for all participating blogs), and update the affiliation\\ninformation
        in their ORCID record. I will also update the internal\\nworkflow at Rogue
        Scholar to enable multiple parallel affiliations, as I\\nknow of a few Rogue
        Scholar authors who fall into this category.\\n\\nThis work further improves
        the metadata quality for blog posts that\\nRogue Scholar is helping provide.
        And it shows that better metadata does\\nnot automatically mean more work
        for authors. Several metadata elements\\nneed further work, e.g. references
        (currently [1,100 blog posts with\\nreferences](https://api.crossref.org/members/31795/works?filter=has-references:true){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}),\\nrelationships

        I was\\nencouraged to work on clarifying the kinds of science blogs Rogue\\nScholar
        wants to focus on in terms of available services and outreach\\nactivities.
        There are several kinds of science blogs for which Rogue\\nScholar is a particularly
        good fit, and I wanted to start with a\\ncategory that is not only very popular
        among science blogs participating\\nin Rogue Scholar (currently more than
        half of all participating blogs),\\nbut also dear to my heart: the personal
        science blog.\\n\\nThe personal science blog is written by a single author
        (with occasional\\nguest posts), expressing his/her expertise and views. The
        author might\\nbe affiliated with an academic institution (as in my first
        five years of\\nblogging), work for an organization that provides services
        for the\\nscholarly community (as in the next nine years of my blogging),
        or is\\nself-employed (as in the last two years of my blogging). Personal
        blogs\\noften write about the kind of content or in formats that don\\\\'t
        fit\\nother channels of scholarly communication (e.g. journal article,\\npreprint,
        or working paper), and long-term maintenance of a personal\\nblog can be a
        particular challenge. However personal blogs are a very\\nvaluable resource,
        and their discovery and long-term maintenance should\\nbe supported.\\n\\nHow
        can Rogue Scholar offer a free service that costs money to build and\\nmaintain?
        By making this free service cost-effective by using open\\nsource software,
        automation, and collaboration, by also offering paid\\nservices, and by continuing
        to accept one-time or recurring donations.\\nSubmit your personal blog to

        (e.g. a journal article, book, dataset, software, or blog post),\\nbut can
        handle lists of scholarly works.\\n\\nMost of the [metadata formats supported
        by\\ncommonmeta-py](https://www.commonmeta.org/implementations){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}\\n(Crossref
        and DataCite JSON and XML, BibTex, RIS, CSL JSON, or\\nSchema.org) can handle
        lists of works, e.g.\\n\\n- a keyword query with the Crossref or DataCite
        REST APIs,\\n- all articles in a journal issue or volume, or all chapters
        in a book,\\n- all references in a journal article, or citations of that article,\\n-
        all references in a Zotero reference manager category,\\n- all versions of
        a preprint, dataset, or software.\\n\\nThe initial support of metadata lists
        in version 0.14 of the\\ncommonmeta-py library allows the reading and/or writing
        of metadata\\nlists via a single Python method, or command-line argument.
        Over time,\\nmore helper methods and error checks will be added, e.g. to support\\nlists

        Scholar science blog archive\\nand addresses an important use case. The Crossref
        API that Rogue Scholar\\nuses for DOI registrations allows batch processing
        of DOI metadata.\\nInstead of registering or updating one DOI record every
        10 minutes,\\nRogue Scholar now triggers the update of 100 DOIs with a single
        XML file\\nwith all metadata every 10 minutes. This requires two method calls:
        1)\\nfetch all Rogue Scholar blog posts that need updating and store them
        in\\na single JSON file, and 2) generate a single XML file and upload it to\\nthe
        Crossref API. This streamlined workflow allows updates of all 15k\\nRogue
        Scholar metadata records with Crossref in 24 hours, compared to\\nthe weeks
        it took before (a speed improvement of 100x). This allows\\nRogue Scholar
        to continue to [use GitHub Actions for DOI\\nregistrations](https://github.com/front-matter/rogue-scholar/actions/workflows/update-dois.yml){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"},\\nfor
        the time being avoiding more complex and expensive infrastructure\\nsetups.\\n\\nRogue
        Scholar can now quickly update DOI metadata in bulk, e.g. add an\\nORCID ID
        to all blog post authors, or the blog name and blog post URLs\\nif a blog
        moves to a different platform, or the archive location for all\\nblog posts
        (once Crossref enables `archive_locations` metadata for\\ncontent type `posted-content`).

        Scholar\\nAPI), and a feature image would be nice. But overall the 10 posts

        blog posts beyond the most recent (e.g.\\nthe last 10) posts. Some blogging
        platforms have APIs, or pagination in\\ntheir Atom/RSS feeds, and it is easy
        to add this functionality for open\\nsource blogging platforms such as Hugo
        or Jekyll.\\n\\nMinor issues are more common and typically revolve around
        authorship:\\n\\n- multiple authors of posts are not supported in the RSS
        feed format\\n  (and the blogging platform doesn\\\\'t support Atom feeds),\\n-
        the blog post authors are different from the author(s) used by the\\n  blogging
        platform. Sometimes this happens with group blogs, especially\\n  with Wordpress
        (which requires a plugin to [enable multiple\\n  co-authors](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org/wordpress){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}).\\n\\nThe
        new Rogue Scholar Preview service further simplifies full-text\\nsearch, DOI
        registration, and archiving for science blogs and\\ndemonstrates that scholarly
        infrastructure doesn\\\\'t need to be\\ncomplicated, expensive, and boring.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.53731/xwxf3-92j40\",\"guid\":\"65ca01e618422c0001e4a609\",\"id\":\"f0bb2ea5-362d-41a9-b8cd-7244f0944026\",\"image\":\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1426604966848-d7adac402bff?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDIyfHxwcmV2aWV3JTIwbmF0dXJlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcwNzczNzY3Mnww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1707740911,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"Today

        January 2024 the new [Rogue Scholar Advisory\\nBoard](https://rogue-scholar.org/board){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        had its first\\nmeeting. It consists of six people with diverse expertise
        in scholarly\\nblogging. Advisory Board members come from different scholarly\\ndisciplines
        and geographic regions, write in several languages besides\\nEnglish, and
        have different levels of technical expertise.\\n\\nThe Advisory Board will
        guide the overall direction of Rogue Scholar,\\nlooking at governance, feature
        development, and outreach activities. The\\nAdvisory Board will meet virtually
        twice a year and publish a public\\nsummary report (where this is the first
        one).\\n\\n### Vision and Mission\\n\\nOne important discussion at the initial
        Advisory Board meeting was about\\nstarting to clarify the vision and mission
        for Rogue Scholar. This\\nincludes short-term but also long-term goals beyond
        the next six months,\\nfor example, more work on clarifying what kind of organizations
        and blog\\ncontent Rogue Scholar should aim to attract, and how the service
        should\\nbe positioned in relation to other scholarly output formats, such
        as\\npreprints and journal articles.\\n\\n### Principles of Open Scholarly
        Infrastructure\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service was launched in 2023 and by
        the end of the\\nyear, the basic infrastructure to support science blogs was
        in place.\\nGoing forward Rogue Scholar will undertake a self-assessment against
        the\\nPrinciples of Open Scholarly Infrastructure\\n([[POSI]{.underline}](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/)).
        This\\nwill happen in the coming months and will identify areas where more
        work\\nand discussion are needed, as the service matures towards a sustainable\\nscholarly
        infrastructure.\\n\\n### Best practices for running a science blog\\n\\nThe
        first year running the Rogue Scholar service had a steep learning\\ncurve
        with many lessons learned regarding persistent identification,\\nmetadata,
        and long-archiving. This experience is valuable for every\\nscience blog and
        should be summarized in a publication targeting the\\nsecond half of 2024.
        The initial publication of key best practices could\\nhappen via a series
        of blog posts and should include updates to the\\n[[Rogue Scholar\\ndocumentation]{.underline}](https://docs.rogue-scholar.org)
        site.\\n\\n### Technical work\\n\\nThe Rogue Scholar service has solved the
        registration of science blog\\nDOIs at scale (more than 13k blog posts so
        far) and promptly (within 30\\nmin after publication). The service works with
        all blogging platforms\\nthat make their content available in a feed. Rogue
        Scholar is\\nregistering important optional metadata, including ORCID identifiers,\\nabstracts,
        references, relations, and funding information.\\n\\nWith registration, discovery
        (via the integrated full-text search), and\\nlong-term archiving (via the
        integration with Internet Archive)\\naddressed, the main technical challenge
        now is the integration of the\\nregistered DOIs and metadata into the participating
        blogs. The solution\\nwill be specific to the respective blogging platform
        and will initially\\nfocus on the most popular platforms WordPress, and static
        site\\ngenerators (Hugo, Jekyll, Quarto, that require very similar workflows).\\n\\n###
        Social Media\\n\\nSocial media are currently undergoing the biggest changes
        in many years,\\nwith the demise of Twitter, and the fragmentation of text-based
        social\\nmedia (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). The role of science\\nblogs
        and their integration with social media platforms is changing, but\\nthe direction
        is not yet clear. For Rogue Scholar that means to focus\\nthe outreach activities
        on blog posts, email, and newsletters until a\\nclearer picture emerges.\\n\\n##
