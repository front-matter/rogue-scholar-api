        respect to Jeffrey, I don't think it quite fully covered\\nwhat's going on
        here. I think it's Clarivate that has problems, not\\neLife.\\n\\nFrom my
        perspective, the tension between innovation in research\\npublishing and Clarivate's
        wish to demonstrate some kind of arbitrary\\n'selectivity' has been bubbling
        along for over a decade now. Researchers\\n& research funders are getting
        to grips with the affordances of\\ndigitality, trying new processes and discovering
        that some processes &\\nworkflows result in better outcomes in terms of rigour,
        financial cost,\\ntransparency, and/or a reduction in research waste. I'm
        thinking\\nparticularly about transparency of process and timing of process.\\nDigitality
        allows for the traditional pre-digital publishing process to\\nbe\\n[decoupled](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full)\\nand

        in some\\ndisciplines to find research being published before peer-review,
        and\\n*then* sent for some kind of peer-review *after* being published online.\\nThis
        is sometimes referred to as the \\\"Publish-\\\\>Review-\\\\>Curate\\\" model.\\n[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/understanding-the-publish-review-curate-prc-model-of-scholarly-communication)\\nhave
        a nice explainer of the PRC model.\\n\\nI infer that Clarivate / Web of Science
        doesn't seem to like the PRC\\nmodel. I don't base this on wild supposition,
        it is based on what I can\\nobserve from the growing fleet of journals that
        are now operating a\\nPRC-only model and are excluded from Clarivate indexing:\\n\\n-

        it would be this (below). Clarivate no longer indexes the best\\nresearch

        CLOCKSS Board will release archived content if the archived content\\nis determined

        at least six consecutive months.\\\"\\n\\nA calendar month may contain**\_28
        to 31 calendar days**, the average is\\n30.437. If we are generous and assume
        30.437 days, then the \\\"six months\\\"\\nreferred to in CLOCKSS agreement
        translates into 182.622 calendar days.\\n193 days is greater than 182 days
        and so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS\\nhave chosen not to publicly release
        *Heterocycles* yet. Who are CLOCKSS\\nserving and who's interests do they
        represent?\\n\\nMy first question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore
        -- why\\nwas the journal not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously\\nunavailable?\\n\\nI
        contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of\\nunavailability
        (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not\\nyet been briefed
        about *Heterocycles* at this point in time! Remarkable!\\nWhere is the sense
        of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that\\nevery single day that the
        journal content remains offline creates harm\\nto the citation potential of
        the articles contained within the journal.\\nCausing harm to individuals (authors),
        research performing\\norganisations, and research funding organisations (at
        the least). The\\ncontent must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any
        delay in\\nexcess of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go
        beyond\\nthe minimum period stated in the contract (and six months is way
        way too\\nlong in my opinion). CLOCKSS needs to be held accountable for this\\nchoice
        to delay the release of the 17,000+ *Heterocycles* journal\\narticles, some
        of which were only published recently, right up into\\n2023!\\n\\nI am rather
        worried about the current governance setup of CLOCKSS -- the\\n[CLOCKSS\\nboard](https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/)\\nis
        rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who is\\nthere
        to represent the interests of authors who have published in these\\njournals?
        Who is there to represent the interests of patients who have\\nbeen experimented
        on, and the results of those experiments published in\\njournals archived
        in CLOCKSS? \\\\[There are medical journals archived in\\nCLOCKSS\\\\]. Who
        is there to represent the interests of charities &\\ntaxpayers who by some
        estimates fund approximately 80% of academic\\nresearch?\\n\\nRather than
        just point the finger, I have offered to join the CLOCKSS\\nboard to see if
        I can add some ideas from within.\\n\\nCLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word
        \\\"community\\\" on their website, but\\nI infer they define their community
        as exclusively just publishers and\\nlibrarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink
        has written a great post\\nrecently about how the term [\\\"community\\\"
        has been\\nco-opted](https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/). I\\nfundamentally
        disagree that publishers and librarians are the *only*\\nstakeholders in published
        scholarship. I see scholarship as a global\\npublic good. This is also [the
        position of the International Science\\nCouncil](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/)\\nand
        others. I really think there needs to be a wider selection of people\\ninvolved
        in the governance & decision-making at CLOCKSS.\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n\\nClause
        4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit\\nvague:
        \\\"Released Content use terms and restrictions will be determined\\nby an
        accompanying Creative Commons license (or equivalent license)\\nchosen either
        by Publisher or, if Publisher fails to respond within\\nthirty (30) days following
        receipt by it of the notice described above,\\nby the CLOCKSS Board.\\\"  \\n
        \ \\nWhen CLOCKSS finally gets around to releasing *Heterocycles* from\\ndarkness,
        which exact Creative Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board\\nchoose? OASPA
        and many other organisations [recommend CC\\nBY](https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/).
        If the CLOCKSS Board chooses\\nCC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND
        it would hamper re-use\\nof the journal content in important Wikimedia projects
        such as\\n[Wikimedia\\nCommons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing).\\n\\n**CLOCKSS
        provides access, not just preservation**\\n\\nIf and when CLOCKSS does release
        *Heterocycles*, it will more than\\ndouble the current number of articles
        that CLOCKSS provides access to,\\nwhich is merely \\\\~13,000 articles at
        the moment. CLOCKSS will\\nincreasingly become a publication platform that
        provides access to\\nresearch that people want & need to read. CLOCKSS is
        not just a digital\\npreservation service -- it is an access provider too.
        I wonder if\\nCLOCKSS has forgotten about the access part? I look forward
        to the day\\nwhen CLOCKSS finally decides to publicly release *Heterocycles*
        to the\\nworld, but as of this moment, I regret to say I am still waiting
        and it\\nis unclear why there is such a delay beyond the 182 day minimum...\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/3wsn2-2kp03\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2553\",\"id\":\"cc09cb8b-f3cf-4580-9124-9a935268799a\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/clockss-logo.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"5jx96-2em96\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"The

        the time of writing this (2024-04-11), the entire content of a \\\"key\\\"\\nchemistry
        journal called *Heterocycles*, with over 17,000 articles in\\nit, from 1973
        to 2023, has been knocked offline due to what the\\npublisher vaguely describes
        as \\\"various circumstances\\\".\\n\\nThe journal has been unavailable to
        access online since December 2023,\\nwhich means the content has been offline
        for four or five months now!\\nDalmeet Singh Chawla (2024) has written an
        excellent piece about this\\ndebacle for the magazine *Chemistry World*. I'd
        recommend you [read\\nit](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/a-key-chemistry-journal-disappeared-from-the-web-others-are-at-risk/4019265.article)\\nbefore
        coming back to read my post here.\\n\\nThe good news is the content isn't
        completely lost. A not-for-profit\\norganisation supposedly dedicated to digital
        preservation of scholarly\\ncontent, called CLOCKSS ought to have a copy of
        every single digital\\narticle that has been published in *Heterocycles*.
        However, recent\\nresearch by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst
        dark archives\\nlike CLOCKSS preserve journal content at a title-level, when
        this is\\nchecked at an *article-level* it can be observed that actual digital\\npreservation
        of journals at the article-level by a dark archive can be\\npatchy.\\n\\nThanks
        to the accompanying website for Eve's (2024) article, we can\\nexamine the
        [exact article-level preservation\\nstatus](https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29)\\nof
        a sample of a thousand articles from *Heterocycles*. All of Eve's\\nsample
        for *Heterocycles* are either \\\"preserved\\\" in CLOCKSS or\\n\\\"preserved
        (in progress)\\\" at CLOCKSS. Eve's work also reveals that\\nincomplete /
        patchy selections of *Heterocycles* articles are preserved\\nat HathiTrust,
        Internet Archive, and OCUL Scholars Portal.\\n\\nSo, I hope CLOCKSS does have
        a complete digital copy of the journal, but\\nthe question is: will CLOCKSS
        make it available? This all depends on\\nCLOCKSS assessment of whether a \\\"trigger
        event\\\" has occurred here. From\\nthe information given on the CLOCKSS website
        it seems that the\\ndefinition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation.
        If a\\ntitle is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer\\nproviding
        access to the content AND there are no successor interests or\\nreversion
        or transfer of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make\\ntheir copies
        available online for all to read. From what the executive\\ndirector of CLOCKSS
        says in the *Chemistry World* interview, it seems\\nCLOCKSS are choosing to
        wait for the publisher of *Heterocycles* to find\\na successor. Alicia Wise
        is quoted as saying: \\\"we will be in a position\\nto make it available should
        they not find a successor organisation to\\nlook after it\\\".\\n\\n**Ethical
        Dilemma**\\n\\nHerein lies the ethical dilemma... how long should CLOCKSS
        wait for the\\npublisher of *Heterocycles* to find a business successor? Over
        17,000\\njournal articles have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS
        cannot\\nand should not wait forever -- it is not ethical to wait for too
        long --\\nit would be unfair on all the authors of the content, the research\\nfunders
        of the content, and the readers who need to read what is\\npublished in it.\\n\\nI
        am troubled by the lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making\\nhere
        -- who decides how long CLOCKSS should wait for business\\nsuccessors, before
        declaring a trigger event? I am concerned about\\npossible conflicts of interest
        that might creep in here too, for\\ninstance *Heterocycles* has a longstanding
        relationship with Elsevier.\\nElsevier were the official distributor of *Heterocycles*
        in all\\ncountries of the world, except for Japan\\n([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles)).\\nIn
        my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a\\n'business successor'
        to take over *Heterocycles* and extract rent from\\nit, for profit. The current
        executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise\\nwho is well known for her time
        in employment at Elsevier as its\\n\\\"[Director of Universal\\nAccess](https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115)\\\".
        Any extra\\ndelay in declaring this a \\\"trigger event\\\" at CLOCKSS could
        be construed\\nas buying time for a business deal to arrange a successor.
        \ \\n  \\nMy personal feeling here is that 4 months is plenty of time. CLOCKSS\\ncurrent
        policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses and business\\ninterests.
        The needs of authors, readers, research funders and research\\ninstitutions
        are ignored.\\n\\nPut yourself in the shoes of an author of a recent article,
        published at\\n*Heterocycles*: you've spent 2 years doing some research, got
        it through\\npeer review, it's published in *Heterocycles* in 2023 and now
        the\\njournal is completely offline and no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber\\ninstitutions)
        can access / read / cite the digital version of your\\narticle \U0001F643\\n\\nAnd
        CLOCKSS just sits there and just says 'well we *could* provide\\ndigital access
        to the articles', but we won't because of business\\ninterests... I would
        be hopping mad!\\n\\nFor instance: \\\"Synthesis of Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones
        Catalyzed by Sodium\\nCyclamate\\\" authored by Ziba Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh
        Kiyani and\\npublished in *Heterocycles* in 2023, \_pp.\_1187-1197, with the
        DOI:\\n[10.3987/com-23-14859](https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859) . Won't\\nthis
        clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work if people\\ncan't
        access the digital copy? If you can't read it, you can't cite it.\\n\\nI know
        that some libraries hold print runs of *Heterocycles*,\\n[WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914)
        data (if\\nreliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most\\nuniversities
        around the world definitely do not have print copies of\\nthis journal.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nOver
        17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4\\nmonths and
        CLOCKSS is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a\\n\\\"trigger
        event\\\".\\n\\nI think research funders, researchers, and research institutions
        need to\\nlook very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research
        --\\nthe old way seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of
        the\\nresearch community. As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023),\\nopenly-licensed
        journal publication provides the resilience we need when\\njournal publishing
        businesses fail, for whatever reason. \\\"All rights\\nreserved\\\" content,

        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby

        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe

        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity

        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere

        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the

        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky
        2,112 institutions to be included in the THE\\nrankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},\\ntherefore
        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able

        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and

        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n

        respect to Jeffrey, I don't think it quite fully covered\\nwhat's going on
        here. I think it's Clarivate that has problems, not\\neLife.\\n\\nFrom my
        perspective, the tension between innovation in research\\npublishing and Clarivate's
        wish to demonstrate some kind of arbitrary\\n'selectivity' has been bubbling
        along for over a decade now. Researchers\\n& research funders are getting
        to grips with the affordances of\\ndigitality, trying new processes and discovering
        that some processes &\\nworkflows result in better outcomes in terms of rigour,
        financial cost,\\ntransparency, and/or a reduction in research waste. I'm
        thinking\\nparticularly about transparency of process and timing of process.\\nDigitality
        allows for the traditional pre-digital publishing process to\\nbe\\n[decoupled](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full)\\nand

        in some\\ndisciplines to find research being published before peer-review,
        and\\n*then* sent for some kind of peer-review *after* being published online.\\nThis
        is sometimes referred to as the \\\"Publish-\\\\>Review-\\\\>Curate\\\" model.\\n[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/understanding-the-publish-review-curate-prc-model-of-scholarly-communication)\\nhave
        a nice explainer of the PRC model.\\n\\nI infer that Clarivate / Web of Science
        doesn't seem to like the PRC\\nmodel. I don't base this on wild supposition,
        it is based on what I can\\nobserve from the growing fleet of journals that
        are now operating a\\nPRC-only model and are excluded from Clarivate indexing:\\n\\n-

        it would be this (below). Clarivate no longer indexes the best\\nresearch

        CLOCKSS Board will release archived content if the archived content\\nis determined

        at least six consecutive months.\\\"\\n\\nA calendar month may contain**\_28
        to 31 calendar days**, the average is\\n30.437. If we are generous and assume
        30.437 days, then the \\\"six months\\\"\\nreferred to in CLOCKSS agreement
        translates into 182.622 calendar days.\\n193 days is greater than 182 days
        and so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS\\nhave chosen not to publicly release
        *Heterocycles* yet. Who are CLOCKSS\\nserving and who's interests do they
        represent?\\n\\nMy first question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore
        -- why\\nwas the journal not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously\\nunavailable?\\n\\nI
        contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of\\nunavailability
        (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not\\nyet been briefed
        about *Heterocycles* at this point in time! Remarkable!\\nWhere is the sense
        of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that\\nevery single day that the
        journal content remains offline creates harm\\nto the citation potential of
        the articles contained within the journal.\\nCausing harm to individuals (authors),
        research performing\\norganisations, and research funding organisations (at
        the least). The\\ncontent must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any
        delay in\\nexcess of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go
        beyond\\nthe minimum period stated in the contract (and six months is way
        way too\\nlong in my opinion). CLOCKSS needs to be held accountable for this\\nchoice
        to delay the release of the 17,000+ *Heterocycles* journal\\narticles, some
        of which were only published recently, right up into\\n2023!\\n\\nI am rather
        worried about the current governance setup of CLOCKSS -- the\\n[CLOCKSS\\nboard](https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/)\\nis
        rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who is\\nthere
        to represent the interests of authors who have published in these\\njournals?
        Who is there to represent the interests of patients who have\\nbeen experimented
        on, and the results of those experiments published in\\njournals archived
        in CLOCKSS? \\\\[There are medical journals archived in\\nCLOCKSS\\\\]. Who
        is there to represent the interests of charities &\\ntaxpayers who by some
        estimates fund approximately 80% of academic\\nresearch?\\n\\nRather than
        just point the finger, I have offered to join the CLOCKSS\\nboard to see if
        I can add some ideas from within.\\n\\nCLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word
        \\\"community\\\" on their website, but\\nI infer they define their community
        as exclusively just publishers and\\nlibrarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink
        has written a great post\\nrecently about how the term [\\\"community\\\"
        has been\\nco-opted](https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/). I\\nfundamentally
        disagree that publishers and librarians are the *only*\\nstakeholders in published
        scholarship. I see scholarship as a global\\npublic good. This is also [the
        position of the International Science\\nCouncil](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/)\\nand
        others. I really think there needs to be a wider selection of people\\ninvolved
        in the governance & decision-making at CLOCKSS.\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n\\nClause
        4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit\\nvague:
        \\\"Released Content use terms and restrictions will be determined\\nby an
        accompanying Creative Commons license (or equivalent license)\\nchosen either
        by Publisher or, if Publisher fails to respond within\\nthirty (30) days following
        receipt by it of the notice described above,\\nby the CLOCKSS Board.\\\"  \\n
        \ \\nWhen CLOCKSS finally gets around to releasing *Heterocycles* from\\ndarkness,
        which exact Creative Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board\\nchoose? OASPA
        and many other organisations [recommend CC\\nBY](https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/).
        If the CLOCKSS Board chooses\\nCC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND
        it would hamper re-use\\nof the journal content in important Wikimedia projects
        such as\\n[Wikimedia\\nCommons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing).\\n\\n**CLOCKSS
        provides access, not just preservation**\\n\\nIf and when CLOCKSS does release
        *Heterocycles*, it will more than\\ndouble the current number of articles
        that CLOCKSS provides access to,\\nwhich is merely \\\\~13,000 articles at
        the moment. CLOCKSS will\\nincreasingly become a publication platform that
        provides access to\\nresearch that people want & need to read. CLOCKSS is
        not just a digital\\npreservation service -- it is an access provider too.
        I wonder if\\nCLOCKSS has forgotten about the access part? I look forward
        to the day\\nwhen CLOCKSS finally decides to publicly release *Heterocycles*
        to the\\nworld, but as of this moment, I regret to say I am still waiting
        and it\\nis unclear why there is such a delay beyond the 182 day minimum...\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/3wsn2-2kp03\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2553\",\"id\":\"cc09cb8b-f3cf-4580-9124-9a935268799a\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/clockss-logo.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"5jx96-2em96\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"The

        the time of writing this (2024-04-11), the entire content of a \\\"key\\\"\\nchemistry
        journal called *Heterocycles*, with over 17,000 articles in\\nit, from 1973
        to 2023, has been knocked offline due to what the\\npublisher vaguely describes
        as \\\"various circumstances\\\".\\n\\nThe journal has been unavailable to
        access online since December 2023,\\nwhich means the content has been offline
        for four or five months now!\\nDalmeet Singh Chawla (2024) has written an
        excellent piece about this\\ndebacle for the magazine *Chemistry World*. I'd
        recommend you [read\\nit](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/a-key-chemistry-journal-disappeared-from-the-web-others-are-at-risk/4019265.article)\\nbefore
        coming back to read my post here.\\n\\nThe good news is the content isn't
        completely lost. A not-for-profit\\norganisation supposedly dedicated to digital
        preservation of scholarly\\ncontent, called CLOCKSS ought to have a copy of
        every single digital\\narticle that has been published in *Heterocycles*.
        However, recent\\nresearch by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst
        dark archives\\nlike CLOCKSS preserve journal content at a title-level, when
        this is\\nchecked at an *article-level* it can be observed that actual digital\\npreservation
        of journals at the article-level by a dark archive can be\\npatchy.\\n\\nThanks
        to the accompanying website for Eve's (2024) article, we can\\nexamine the
        [exact article-level preservation\\nstatus](https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29)\\nof
        a sample of a thousand articles from *Heterocycles*. All of Eve's\\nsample
        for *Heterocycles* are either \\\"preserved\\\" in CLOCKSS or\\n\\\"preserved
        (in progress)\\\" at CLOCKSS. Eve's work also reveals that\\nincomplete /
        patchy selections of *Heterocycles* articles are preserved\\nat HathiTrust,
        Internet Archive, and OCUL Scholars Portal.\\n\\nSo, I hope CLOCKSS does have
        a complete digital copy of the journal, but\\nthe question is: will CLOCKSS
        make it available? This all depends on\\nCLOCKSS assessment of whether a \\\"trigger
        event\\\" has occurred here. From\\nthe information given on the CLOCKSS website
        it seems that the\\ndefinition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation.
        If a\\ntitle is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer\\nproviding
        access to the content AND there are no successor interests or\\nreversion
        or transfer of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make\\ntheir copies
        available online for all to read. From what the executive\\ndirector of CLOCKSS
        says in the *Chemistry World* interview, it seems\\nCLOCKSS are choosing to
        wait for the publisher of *Heterocycles* to find\\na successor. Alicia Wise
        is quoted as saying: \\\"we will be in a position\\nto make it available should
        they not find a successor organisation to\\nlook after it\\\".\\n\\n**Ethical
        Dilemma**\\n\\nHerein lies the ethical dilemma... how long should CLOCKSS
        wait for the\\npublisher of *Heterocycles* to find a business successor? Over
        17,000\\njournal articles have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS
        cannot\\nand should not wait forever -- it is not ethical to wait for too
        long --\\nit would be unfair on all the authors of the content, the research\\nfunders
        of the content, and the readers who need to read what is\\npublished in it.\\n\\nI
        am troubled by the lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making\\nhere
        -- who decides how long CLOCKSS should wait for business\\nsuccessors, before
        declaring a trigger event? I am concerned about\\npossible conflicts of interest
        that might creep in here too, for\\ninstance *Heterocycles* has a longstanding
        relationship with Elsevier.\\nElsevier were the official distributor of *Heterocycles*
        in all\\ncountries of the world, except for Japan\\n([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles)).\\nIn
        my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a\\n'business successor'
        to take over *Heterocycles* and extract rent from\\nit, for profit. The current
        executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise\\nwho is well known for her time
        in employment at Elsevier as its\\n\\\"[Director of Universal\\nAccess](https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115)\\\".
        Any extra\\ndelay in declaring this a \\\"trigger event\\\" at CLOCKSS could
        be construed\\nas buying time for a business deal to arrange a successor.
        \ \\n  \\nMy personal feeling here is that 4 months is plenty of time. CLOCKSS\\ncurrent
        policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses and business\\ninterests.
        The needs of authors, readers, research funders and research\\ninstitutions
        are ignored.\\n\\nPut yourself in the shoes of an author of a recent article,
        published at\\n*Heterocycles*: you've spent 2 years doing some research, got
        it through\\npeer review, it's published in *Heterocycles* in 2023 and now
        the\\njournal is completely offline and no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber\\ninstitutions)
        can access / read / cite the digital version of your\\narticle \U0001F643\\n\\nAnd
        CLOCKSS just sits there and just says 'well we *could* provide\\ndigital access
        to the articles', but we won't because of business\\ninterests... I would
        be hopping mad!\\n\\nFor instance: \\\"Synthesis of Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones
        Catalyzed by Sodium\\nCyclamate\\\" authored by Ziba Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh
        Kiyani and\\npublished in *Heterocycles* in 2023, \_pp.\_1187-1197, with the
        DOI:\\n[10.3987/com-23-14859](https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859) . Won't\\nthis
        clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work if people\\ncan't
        access the digital copy? If you can't read it, you can't cite it.\\n\\nI know
        that some libraries hold print runs of *Heterocycles*,\\n[WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914)
        data (if\\nreliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most\\nuniversities
        around the world definitely do not have print copies of\\nthis journal.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nOver
        17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4\\nmonths and
        CLOCKSS is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a\\n\\\"trigger
        event\\\".\\n\\nI think research funders, researchers, and research institutions
        need to\\nlook very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research
        --\\nthe old way seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of
        the\\nresearch community. As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023),\\nopenly-licensed
        journal publication provides the resilience we need when\\njournal publishing
        businesses fail, for whatever reason. \\\"All rights\\nreserved\\\" content,

        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby

        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe

        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity

        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere

        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the

        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky
        2,112 institutions to be included in the THE\\nrankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},\\ntherefore
        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able

        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and

        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n

        respect to Jeffrey, I don't think it quite fully covered\\nwhat's going on
        here. I think it's Clarivate that has problems, not\\neLife.\\n\\nFrom my
        perspective, the tension between innovation in research\\npublishing and Clarivate's
        wish to demonstrate some kind of arbitrary\\n'selectivity' has been bubbling
        along for over a decade now. Researchers\\n& research funders are getting
        to grips with the affordances of\\ndigitality, trying new processes and discovering
        that some processes &\\nworkflows result in better outcomes in terms of rigour,
        financial cost,\\ntransparency, and/or a reduction in research waste. I'm
        thinking\\nparticularly about transparency of process and timing of process.\\nDigitality
        allows for the traditional pre-digital publishing process to\\nbe\\n[decoupled](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full)\\nand

        in some\\ndisciplines to find research being published before peer-review,
        and\\n*then* sent for some kind of peer-review *after* being published online.\\nThis
        is sometimes referred to as the \\\"Publish-\\\\>Review-\\\\>Curate\\\" model.\\n[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/understanding-the-publish-review-curate-prc-model-of-scholarly-communication)\\nhave
        a nice explainer of the PRC model.\\n\\nI infer that Clarivate / Web of Science
        doesn't seem to like the PRC\\nmodel. I don't base this on wild supposition,
        it is based on what I can\\nobserve from the growing fleet of journals that
        are now operating a\\nPRC-only model and are excluded from Clarivate indexing:\\n\\n-

        archive.\\n\\nAccording to the CLOCKSS [standard participating\\nagreement](https://clockss.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CLOCKSS-Participating-Publisher-Agreement-2024.pdf),\\nthe
        CLOCKSS Board will release archived content if the archived content\\nis determined
        in good faith by the Board \\\"...to be unavailable from any\\npublisher for
        at least six consecutive months.\\\"\\n\\nA calendar month may contain**\_28
        to 31 calendar days**, the average is\\n30.437. If we are generous and assume
        30.437 days, then the \\\"six months\\\"\\nreferred to in CLOCKSS agreement
        translates into 182.622 calendar days.\\n193 days is greater than 182 days
        and so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS\\nhave chosen not to publicly release
        *Heterocycles* yet. Who are CLOCKSS\\nserving and who's interests do they
        represent?\\n\\nMy first question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore
        -- why\\nwas the journal not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously\\nunavailable?\\n\\nI
        contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of\\nunavailability
        (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not\\nyet been briefed
        about *Heterocycles* at this point in time! Remarkable!\\nWhere is the sense
        of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that\\nevery single day that the
        journal content remains offline creates harm\\nto the citation potential of
        the articles contained within the journal.\\nCausing harm to individuals (authors),
        research performing\\norganisations, and research funding organisations (at
        the least). The\\ncontent must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any
        delay in\\nexcess of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go
        beyond\\nthe minimum period stated in the contract (and six months is way
        way too\\nlong in my opinion). CLOCKSS needs to be held accountable for this\\nchoice
        to delay the release of the 17,000+ *Heterocycles* journal\\narticles, some
        of which were only published recently, right up into\\n2023!\\n\\nI am rather
        worried about the current governance setup of CLOCKSS -- the\\n[CLOCKSS\\nboard](https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/)\\nis
        rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who is\\nthere
        to represent the interests of authors who have published in these\\njournals?
        Who is there to represent the interests of patients who have\\nbeen experimented
        on, and the results of those experiments published in\\njournals archived
        in CLOCKSS? \\\\[There are medical journals archived in\\nCLOCKSS\\\\]. Who
        is there to represent the interests of charities &\\ntaxpayers who by some
        estimates fund approximately 80% of academic\\nresearch?\\n\\nRather than
        just point the finger, I have offered to join the CLOCKSS\\nboard to see if
        I can add some ideas from within.\\n\\nCLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word
        \\\"community\\\" on their website, but\\nI infer they define their community
        as exclusively just publishers and\\nlibrarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink
        has written a great post\\nrecently about how the term [\\\"community\\\"
        has been\\nco-opted](https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/). I\\nfundamentally
        disagree that publishers and librarians are the *only*\\nstakeholders in published
        scholarship. I see scholarship as a global\\npublic good. This is also [the
        position of the International Science\\nCouncil](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/)\\nand
        others. I really think there needs to be a wider selection of people\\ninvolved
        in the governance & decision-making at CLOCKSS.\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n\\nClause
        4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit\\nvague:
        \\\"Released Content use terms and restrictions will be determined\\nby an
        accompanying Creative Commons license (or equivalent license)\\nchosen either
        by Publisher or, if Publisher fails to respond within\\nthirty (30) days following
        receipt by it of the notice described above,\\nby the CLOCKSS Board.\\\"  \\n
        \ \\nWhen CLOCKSS finally gets around to releasing *Heterocycles* from\\ndarkness,
        which exact Creative Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board\\nchoose? OASPA
        and many other organisations [recommend CC\\nBY](https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/).
        If the CLOCKSS Board chooses\\nCC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND
        it would hamper re-use\\nof the journal content in important Wikimedia projects
        such as\\n[Wikimedia\\nCommons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing).\\n\\n**CLOCKSS
        provides access, not just preservation**\\n\\nIf and when CLOCKSS does release
        *Heterocycles*, it will more than\\ndouble the current number of articles
        that CLOCKSS provides access to,\\nwhich is merely \\\\~13,000 articles at
        the moment. CLOCKSS will\\nincreasingly become a publication platform that
        provides access to\\nresearch that people want & need to read. CLOCKSS is
        not just a digital\\npreservation service -- it is an access provider too.
        I wonder if\\nCLOCKSS has forgotten about the access part? I look forward
        to the day\\nwhen CLOCKSS finally decides to publicly release *Heterocycles*
        to the\\nworld, but as of this moment, I regret to say I am still waiting
        and it\\nis unclear why there is such a delay beyond the 182 day minimum...\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/3wsn2-2kp03\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2553\",\"id\":\"cc09cb8b-f3cf-4580-9124-9a935268799a\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/clockss-logo.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"5jx96-2em96\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"The

        the time of writing this (2024-04-11), the entire content of a \\\"key\\\"\\nchemistry
        journal called *Heterocycles*, with over 17,000 articles in\\nit, from 1973
        to 2023, has been knocked offline due to what the\\npublisher vaguely describes
        as \\\"various circumstances\\\".\\n\\nThe journal has been unavailable to
        access online since December 2023,\\nwhich means the content has been offline
        for four or five months now!\\nDalmeet Singh Chawla (2024) has written an
        excellent piece about this\\ndebacle for the magazine *Chemistry World*. I'd
        recommend you [read\\nit](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/a-key-chemistry-journal-disappeared-from-the-web-others-are-at-risk/4019265.article)\\nbefore
        coming back to read my post here.\\n\\nThe good news is the content isn't
        completely lost. A not-for-profit\\norganisation supposedly dedicated to digital
        preservation of scholarly\\ncontent, called CLOCKSS ought to have a copy of
        every single digital\\narticle that has been published in *Heterocycles*.
        However, recent\\nresearch by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst
        dark archives\\nlike CLOCKSS preserve journal content at a title-level, when
        this is\\nchecked at an *article-level* it can be observed that actual digital\\npreservation
        of journals at the article-level by a dark archive can be\\npatchy.\\n\\nThanks
        to the accompanying website for Eve's (2024) article, we can\\nexamine the
        [exact article-level preservation\\nstatus](https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29)\\nof
        a sample of a thousand articles from *Heterocycles*. All of Eve's\\nsample
        for *Heterocycles* are either \\\"preserved\\\" in CLOCKSS or\\n\\\"preserved
        (in progress)\\\" at CLOCKSS. Eve's work also reveals that\\nincomplete /
        patchy selections of *Heterocycles* articles are preserved\\nat HathiTrust,
        Internet Archive, and OCUL Scholars Portal.\\n\\nSo, I hope CLOCKSS does have
        a complete digital copy of the journal, but\\nthe question is: will CLOCKSS
        make it available? This all depends on\\nCLOCKSS assessment of whether a \\\"trigger
        event\\\" has occurred here. From\\nthe information given on the CLOCKSS website
        it seems that the\\ndefinition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation.
        If a\\ntitle is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer\\nproviding
        access to the content AND there are no successor interests or\\nreversion
        or transfer of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make\\ntheir copies
        available online for all to read. From what the executive\\ndirector of CLOCKSS
        says in the *Chemistry World* interview, it seems\\nCLOCKSS are choosing to
        wait for the publisher of *Heterocycles* to find\\na successor. Alicia Wise
        is quoted as saying: \\\"we will be in a position\\nto make it available should
        they not find a successor organisation to\\nlook after it\\\".\\n\\n**Ethical
        Dilemma**\\n\\nHerein lies the ethical dilemma... how long should CLOCKSS
        wait for the\\npublisher of *Heterocycles* to find a business successor? Over
        17,000\\njournal articles have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS
        cannot\\nand should not wait forever -- it is not ethical to wait for too
        long --\\nit would be unfair on all the authors of the content, the research\\nfunders
        of the content, and the readers who need to read what is\\npublished in it.\\n\\nI
        am troubled by the lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making\\nhere
        -- who decides how long CLOCKSS should wait for business\\nsuccessors, before
        declaring a trigger event? I am concerned about\\npossible conflicts of interest
        that might creep in here too, for\\ninstance *Heterocycles* has a longstanding
        relationship with Elsevier.\\nElsevier were the official distributor of *Heterocycles*
        in all\\ncountries of the world, except for Japan\\n([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles)).\\nIn
        my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a\\n'business successor'
        to take over *Heterocycles* and extract rent from\\nit, for profit. The current
        executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise\\nwho is well known for her time
        in employment at Elsevier as its\\n\\\"[Director of Universal\\nAccess](https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115)\\\".
        Any extra\\ndelay in declaring this a \\\"trigger event\\\" at CLOCKSS could
        be construed\\nas buying time for a business deal to arrange a successor.
        \ \\n  \\nMy personal feeling here is that 4 months is plenty of time. CLOCKSS\\ncurrent
        policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses and business\\ninterests.
        The needs of authors, readers, research funders and research\\ninstitutions
        are ignored.\\n\\nPut yourself in the shoes of an author of a recent article,
        published at\\n*Heterocycles*: you've spent 2 years doing some research, got
        it through\\npeer review, it's published in *Heterocycles* in 2023 and now
        the\\njournal is completely offline and no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber\\ninstitutions)
        can access / read / cite the digital version of your\\narticle \U0001F643\\n\\nAnd
        CLOCKSS just sits there and just says 'well we *could* provide\\ndigital access
        to the articles', but we won't because of business\\ninterests... I would
        be hopping mad!\\n\\nFor instance: \\\"Synthesis of Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones
        Catalyzed by Sodium\\nCyclamate\\\" authored by Ziba Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh
        Kiyani and\\npublished in *Heterocycles* in 2023, \_pp.\_1187-1197, with the
        DOI:\\n[10.3987/com-23-14859](https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859) . Won't\\nthis
        clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work if people\\ncan't
        access the digital copy? If you can't read it, you can't cite it.\\n\\nI know
        that some libraries hold print runs of *Heterocycles*,\\n[WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914)
        data (if\\nreliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most\\nuniversities
        around the world definitely do not have print copies of\\nthis journal.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nOver
        17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4\\nmonths and
        CLOCKSS is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a\\n\\\"trigger
        event\\\".\\n\\nI think research funders, researchers, and research institutions
        need to\\nlook very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research
        --\\nthe old way seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of
        the\\nresearch community. As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023),\\nopenly-licensed
        journal publication provides the resilience we need when\\njournal publishing
        businesses fail, for whatever reason. \\\"All rights\\nreserved\\\" content,
        published behind a paywall with a subscription like\\n*Heterocycles* creates
        a lot of headaches and heartaches when they fail.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\nDalmeet

        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding

        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed

        it will at least help provide a minimum bound answer to the\\nquestion.\\n\\nI
        downloaded journal-level data in .csv format from the DOAJ [public\\ndata

        on each journal, one journal per line. A very crude preliminary\\nsearch of
        the .csv file, after subsetting the data to exclude APC-OA\\njournals, reveals
        that 947 lines of the file include the word 'society',\\nalbeit one of these
        lines is the header row. \\\\[e.g. *grep -i 'society'\\nDOAJdata.csv \\\\|

        has the word\\n'Society' in the journal title but is not actually published-for

        call\\nthemselves a society using that \\\\_exact\\\\_ word, in English.\\nUnsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use\\nlanguages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often\\nregistered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better\\njob of attempting to find all
        the society-affiliated journals in DOAJ,\\none needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the\\n[Wikidata item on 'learned\\nsociety'](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824)

        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe

        downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do
        (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms
        of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis and many others all\\nsimultaneously
        went offline for roughly a 24 hour period because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon),
        the publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        One thing that I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all three of these
        citation\\ndistributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of
        the R\\npackage\\n'[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny

        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded

        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a

        Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David Stuart, and\\nSusie
        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky
        2,112 institutions to be included in the THE\\nrankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},\\ntherefore
        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able
        to release the broader\\ndataset. If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise

        available [from\\nfigshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238)\\nunder
        a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list of DOIs\\npertaining to
        the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply for\\nan NDA. **SpringerNature

        their assistance.\\n\\n**A closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints

        that has occurred to create the\\nwhitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. 'Physics'\\nwe can observe from the dataset that the median

        SpringerNature, my own analysis) for\\n  the 111 papers published in 2018

        by\\n  SpringerNature, the median number of citations is **10 citations**\\n\\nFrom
        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and
        green OA as routes to achieving public access to research is\\nnegligible.\\n\\nProviding
        open access or at least public access to a version of a\\nresearch output
        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation
        advantage' (OACA) but a recent\\nmeta-analysis points out that most of them

        'Going for Gold' SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly\\nexecuted
        studies.\\n\\n**What then with regard to costs?**\\n\\n- arXiv's running costs

        \ from the world's research institutions\\\\]\\n- By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature
        physics journals, hybrid gold APCs\\n  vary from \\\\$4480 in *The Astronomy
        and Astrophysics Review* to just\\n  \\\\$2690 in *Celestial Mechanics and
        Dynamical Astronomy*, **the median\\n  list price per article to enable open
        access in SN hybrid Physics\\n  journals is \\\\$2780**\\n- Alternatively,
        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n
        \ In the [2021 Irish IREL consortium\\n  agreement](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/)\\n
        \ with Springer Nature, Irish institutions covered by that agreement\\n  will
        pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access, which if we convert that\\n  from
        Euros to USD is **\\\\$2727.80 per article**.\\n- Another interesting comparator
        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access
        journals**. The SN whitepaper\\n  chose to provide analysis exclusively of
        'hybrid' journals. A suitable\\n  physics journal that enables open access

      tension between innovation in research\\npublishing and Clarivate's wish to
      demonstrate some kind of arbitrary\\n'selectivity' has been bubbling along for
      over a decade now. Researchers\\n& research funders are getting to grips with
      the affordances of\\ndigitality, trying new processes and discovering that some
      processes &\\nworkflows result in better outcomes in terms of rigour, financial
      cost,\\ntransparency, and/or a reduction in research waste. I'm thinking\\nparticularly
      about transparency of process and timing of process.\\nDigitality allows for

      a nice explainer of the PRC model.\\n\\nI infer that Clarivate / Web of Science
      doesn't seem to like the PRC\\nmodel. I don't base this on wild supposition,

      are now operating a\\nPRC-only model and are excluded from Clarivate indexing:\\n\\n-

      Is this an\\nintended new revenue stream for Elsevier? To sell open access articles\\npay-per-view,
      and hope no-one notices the dubious ethics of this\\npractice, whilst they rake
      in the money?\\n\\nHow many other people have been tricked into purchasing access
      to open\\naccess articles? How much money has Elsevier made in the past 10 years\\nfrom
      selling \\\"open access\\\" articles to readers -- precisely against the\\nbasic
      ethos of the phrase?\\n\\nIn late 2014 Elsevier fessed-up to [incorrectly selling
      about \\\\$70,000\\nUSD worth of pay-per-views to customers wanting to read
      open access\\narticles](https://web.archive.org/web/20151118042606/https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey)\\n(and
      I note that the web page on Elsevier's website documenting this\\napology seems
      to have been moved, or taken down, and thus I have to\\npoint you to an archived
      copy at the Internet Archive. Hmmm...). I think\\nElsevier, and preferably an
      external independent auditor need to take a\\nhard look again at Elsevier's

      CLOCKSS Board will release archived content if the archived content\\nis determined
      in good faith by the Board \\\"...to be unavailable from any\\npublisher for
      at least six consecutive months.\\\"\\n\\nA calendar month may contain**\_28
      to 31 calendar days**, the average is\\n30.437. If we are generous and assume
      30.437 days, then the \\\"six months\\\"\\nreferred to in CLOCKSS agreement
      translates into 182.622 calendar days.\\n193 days is greater than 182 days and
      so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS\\nhave chosen not to publicly release *Heterocycles*
      yet. Who are CLOCKSS\\nserving and who's interests do they represent?\\n\\nMy
      first question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore -- why\\nwas the
      journal not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously\\nunavailable?\\n\\nI
      contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of\\nunavailability
      (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not\\nyet been briefed
      about *Heterocycles* at this point in time! Remarkable!\\nWhere is the sense
      of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that\\nevery single day that the
      journal content remains offline creates harm\\nto the citation potential of
      the articles contained within the journal.\\nCausing harm to individuals (authors),
      research performing\\norganisations, and research funding organisations (at
      the least). The\\ncontent must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any
      delay in\\nexcess of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go beyond\\nthe
      minimum period stated in the contract (and six months is way way too\\nlong
      in my opinion). CLOCKSS needs to be held accountable for this\\nchoice to delay
      the release of the 17,000+ *Heterocycles* journal\\narticles, some of which
      were only published recently, right up into\\n2023!\\n\\nI am rather worried
      about the current governance setup of CLOCKSS -- the\\n[CLOCKSS\\nboard](https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/)\\nis
      rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who is\\nthere to
      represent the interests of authors who have published in these\\njournals? Who
      is there to represent the interests of patients who have\\nbeen experimented
      on, and the results of those experiments published in\\njournals archived in
      CLOCKSS? \\\\[There are medical journals archived in\\nCLOCKSS\\\\]. Who is
      there to represent the interests of charities &\\ntaxpayers who by some estimates
      fund approximately 80% of academic\\nresearch?\\n\\nRather than just point the
      finger, I have offered to join the CLOCKSS\\nboard to see if I can add some
      ideas from within.\\n\\nCLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word \\\"community\\\"
      on their website, but\\nI infer they define their community as exclusively just
      publishers and\\nlibrarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink has written a great
      post\\nrecently about how the term [\\\"community\\\" has been\\nco-opted](https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/).
      I\\nfundamentally disagree that publishers and librarians are the *only*\\nstakeholders
      in published scholarship. I see scholarship as a global\\npublic good. This
      is also [the position of the International Science\\nCouncil](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/)\\nand
      others. I really think there needs to be a wider selection of people\\ninvolved
      in the governance & decision-making at CLOCKSS.\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n\\nClause
      4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit\\nvague: \\\"Released
      Content use terms and restrictions will be determined\\nby an accompanying Creative
      Commons license (or equivalent license)\\nchosen either by Publisher or, if
      Publisher fails to respond within\\nthirty (30) days following receipt by it
      of the notice described above,\\nby the CLOCKSS Board.\\\"  \\n  \\nWhen CLOCKSS
      finally gets around to releasing *Heterocycles* from\\ndarkness, which exact
      Creative Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board\\nchoose? OASPA and many other
      organisations [recommend CC\\nBY](https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/). If
      the CLOCKSS Board chooses\\nCC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND
      it would hamper re-use\\nof the journal content in important Wikimedia projects
      such as\\n[Wikimedia\\nCommons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing).\\n\\n**CLOCKSS
      provides access, not just preservation**\\n\\nIf and when CLOCKSS does release
      *Heterocycles*, it will more than\\ndouble the current number of articles that
      CLOCKSS provides access to,\\nwhich is merely \\\\~13,000 articles at the moment.
      CLOCKSS will\\nincreasingly become a publication platform that provides access
      to\\nresearch that people want & need to read. CLOCKSS is not just a digital\\npreservation
      service -- it is an access provider too. I wonder if\\nCLOCKSS has forgotten
      about the access part? I look forward to the day\\nwhen CLOCKSS finally decides
      to publicly release *Heterocycles* to the\\nworld, but as of this moment, I
      regret to say I am still waiting and it\\nis unclear why there is such a delay
      beyond the 182 day minimum...\\n\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"updated_at\":1718106643,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      coming back to read my post here.\\n\\nThe good news is the content isn't completely
      lost. A not-for-profit\\norganisation supposedly dedicated to digital preservation
      of scholarly\\ncontent, called CLOCKSS ought to have a copy of every single
      digital\\narticle that has been published in *Heterocycles*. However, recent\\nresearch
      by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst dark archives\\nlike CLOCKSS
      preserve journal content at a title-level, when this is\\nchecked at an *article-level*
      it can be observed that actual digital\\npreservation of journals at the article-level
      by a dark archive can be\\npatchy.\\n\\nThanks to the accompanying website for
      Eve's (2024) article, we can\\nexamine the [exact article-level preservation\\nstatus](https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29)\\nof
      a sample of a thousand articles from *Heterocycles*. All of Eve's\\nsample for
      *Heterocycles* are either \\\"preserved\\\" in CLOCKSS or\\n\\\"preserved (in
      progress)\\\" at CLOCKSS. Eve's work also reveals that\\nincomplete / patchy
      selections of *Heterocycles* articles are preserved\\nat HathiTrust, Internet
      Archive, and OCUL Scholars Portal.\\n\\nSo, I hope CLOCKSS does have a complete
      digital copy of the journal, but\\nthe question is: will CLOCKSS make it available?
      This all depends on\\nCLOCKSS assessment of whether a \\\"trigger event\\\"
      has occurred here. From\\nthe information given on the CLOCKSS website it seems
      that the\\ndefinition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation. If
      a\\ntitle is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer\\nproviding
      access to the content AND there are no successor interests or\\nreversion or
      transfer of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make\\ntheir copies available
      online for all to read. From what the executive\\ndirector of CLOCKSS says in
      the *Chemistry World* interview, it seems\\nCLOCKSS are choosing to wait for
      the publisher of *Heterocycles* to find\\na successor. Alicia Wise is quoted
      as saying: \\\"we will be in a position\\nto make it available should they not
      find a successor organisation to\\nlook after it\\\".\\n\\n**Ethical Dilemma**\\n\\nHerein
      lies the ethical dilemma... how long should CLOCKSS wait for the\\npublisher
      of *Heterocycles* to find a business successor? Over 17,000\\njournal articles
      have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS cannot\\nand should not wait
      forever -- it is not ethical to wait for too long --\\nit would be unfair on
      all the authors of the content, the research\\nfunders of the content, and the
      readers who need to read what is\\npublished in it.\\n\\nI am troubled by the
      lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making\\nhere -- who decides how long
      CLOCKSS should wait for business\\nsuccessors, before declaring a trigger event?
      I am concerned about\\npossible conflicts of interest that might creep in here
      too, for\\ninstance *Heterocycles* has a longstanding relationship with Elsevier.\\nElsevier
      were the official distributor of *Heterocycles* in all\\ncountries of the world,
      except for Japan\\n([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles)).\\nIn
      my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a\\n'business successor'
      to take over *Heterocycles* and extract rent from\\nit, for profit. The current
      executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise\\nwho is well known for her time
      in employment at Elsevier as its\\n\\\"[Director of Universal\\nAccess](https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115)\\\".
      Any extra\\ndelay in declaring this a \\\"trigger event\\\" at CLOCKSS could
      be construed\\nas buying time for a business deal to arrange a successor.  \\n
      \ \\nMy personal feeling here is that 4 months is plenty of time. CLOCKSS\\ncurrent
      policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses and business\\ninterests.
      The needs of authors, readers, research funders and research\\ninstitutions
      are ignored.\\n\\nPut yourself in the shoes of an author of a recent article,
      published at\\n*Heterocycles*: you've spent 2 years doing some research, got
      it through\\npeer review, it's published in *Heterocycles* in 2023 and now the\\njournal
      is completely offline and no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber\\ninstitutions)
      can access / read / cite the digital version of your\\narticle \U0001F643\\n\\nAnd
      CLOCKSS just sits there and just says 'well we *could* provide\\ndigital access
      to the articles', but we won't because of business\\ninterests... I would be
      hopping mad!\\n\\nFor instance: \\\"Synthesis of Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones Catalyzed
      by Sodium\\nCyclamate\\\" authored by Ziba Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh Kiyani and\\npublished
      in *Heterocycles* in 2023, \_pp.\_1187-1197, with the DOI:\\n[10.3987/com-23-14859](https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859)
      . Won't\\nthis clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work if
      people\\ncan't access the digital copy? If you can't read it, you can't cite
      it.\\n\\nI know that some libraries hold print runs of *Heterocycles*,\\n[WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914)
      data (if\\nreliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most\\nuniversities
      around the world definitely do not have print copies of\\nthis journal.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nOver
      17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4\\nmonths and CLOCKSS
      is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a\\n\\\"trigger event\\\".\\n\\nI
      think research funders, researchers, and research institutions need to\\nlook
      very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research --\\nthe old way
      seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of the\\nresearch community.
      As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023),\\nopenly-licensed journal publication
      provides the resilience we need when\\njournal publishing businesses fail, for
      whatever reason. \\\"All rights\\nreserved\\\" content, published behind a paywall

      \ \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
      the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
      de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
      to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful and
      difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
      institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
      including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
      are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
      DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed in
      DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do hope
      DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the global\\ncommunity.
      Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes
      anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus will\\narbitrarily stop
      offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus spiral into a
      managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching, that's for
      sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading scholarly database

      journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
      that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing about
      the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
      there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
      Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
      access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
      on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
      (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut open
      access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude to in
      the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access systems,
      that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a) availability
      on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that makes it legally
      easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such as Google Scholar,
      [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
      can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
      stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
      and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
      or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
      experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
      the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
      remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time you
      see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please let
      me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation experiments
      that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences in impact
      between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does anyone maintain
      a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic publishers? There\\nhave
      been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\">\\n<a\\nhref=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png\\\"><img\\nsrc=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-1024x716.png\\\"\\nclass=\\\"wp-image-2410\\\"

      I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all three of these citation\\ndistributions
      is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R\\npackage\\n'[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
      I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
      any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of a
      strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1, the
      \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas a skew

      No. Why?\\n\\n1.) SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir
      sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they\\ncould have otherwise
      included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude who knows what
      the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge unaddressed flaw
      in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to author manuscripts
      made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature hybrid journals set
      an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
      on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
      that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
      OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
      copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives the
      \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit to
      take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold OA\\\"
      set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue citations
      relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
      But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
      author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
      be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
      provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
      SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
      with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
      funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
      non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
      does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
      results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice for
      research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
      research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most expensive\\nway
      possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary appears
      happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
      the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
      no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options over\\ntime.
      At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch institutions
      simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at Springer Nature
      for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a tiny citation benefit
      over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per article? I think not.\\n\\n5.)
      Fully open access journals of which [there are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
      data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and often
      higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with *SciPost
      Physics* in\\n[Part 1 of this\\nseries](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}.
      \ \\n  \\nAll that SpringerNature have demonstrated with their white paper is\\nalarming
      statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility and\\ntransparency. Given

      of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
      journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is a
      journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit that
      it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled if
      one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
      or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
      article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
      journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
      article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
      just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
      payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
      assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
      \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
      of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments, policymakers,
      and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$)
      on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
      which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
      benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
      and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
      earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
      as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation
      of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
      to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
      Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
      and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do their
      analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which intervention
      has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial pricing\\ndifferential
      between the two. Simply put, the experimental design in the\\n(not peer reviewed)
      white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs
      with any analysis it's always good to look at the data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature
      white paper they look at full original research\\npapers (excluding other items
      found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters, News, Correction Notices,
      Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries,
      \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product News\\\" , et cetera) that are
      first published online at the\\njournal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
      2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive). An interesting quirk of this is that
      lots of research\\narticles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
      are excluded\\nbecause they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
      to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles in the
      SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished
      online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just
      an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal,
      namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
      I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full research
      articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year 2018 (53),
      and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included in SN's\\nwhitepaper
      dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes 24 (=53-29)
      of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
      SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
      On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where all
      the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
      \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
      published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
      (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
      THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between these
      two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated in
      the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts
      to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals,\\npublished
      in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a\\nrandom sample
      but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull research articles
      with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112 institutions included
      in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For context, estimates vary,
      but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher education institutions
      in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology). This bakes-in
      a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly\\nglobal
      or balanced picture of what's being published in SN hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir
      vague description of their selection methodology doesn't even\\ncorrespond with
      the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes Sociaux*, I found
      [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
      (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is a
      hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
      author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
      the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky
      2,112 institutions to be included in the THE\\nrankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},\\ntherefore
      I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567 articles.
      The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333 articles
      to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their stated selection
      criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list
      of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the\\nresponse
      from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able to release the broader\\ndataset. If
      you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset,\\nI'll look into
      the appropriate contact internally for this purpose\\\"*. I\\ncan't help but
      note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available [from\\nfigshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238)\\nunder

      very same study it is hinted I would have to apply for\\nan NDA. **SpringerNature
      operate transparency and open licensing only\\nwhen it suits them**. I have
      no intention of ever signing a\\nnon-disclosure agreement with SpringerNature
      and so I assume I will now\\nhave to recreate the list of \\\\~ 157,333 full
      research articles published\\nin SN hybrid journals in 2018, myself, without
      their assistance.\\n\\n**A closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints

      examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and
      green OA as routes to achieving public access to research is\\nnegligible.\\n\\nProviding
      open access or at least public access to a version of a\\nresearch output from
      a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact (e.g.
      citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed studies
      have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation advantage'
      (OACA) but a recent\\nmeta-analysis points out that most of them are poorly\\ndone](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129).\\nThis
      'Going for Gold' SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly\\nexecuted
      studies.\\n\\n**What then with regard to costs?**\\n\\n- arXiv's running costs
      famously amount to **[less than \\\\$10 per\\n  paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18351?proof=t)**.\\n
      \ \\\\[I'm [conscious that this is a barebones figure that is not\\n  sustainable

      \ from the world's research institutions\\\\]\\n- By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature
      physics journals, hybrid gold APCs\\n  vary from \\\\$4480 in *The Astronomy
      and Astrophysics Review* to just\\n  \\\\$2690 in *Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical
      Astronomy*, **the median\\n  list price per article to enable open access in
      SN hybrid Physics\\n  journals is \\\\$2780**\\n- Alternatively, one could calculate
      the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated per article costs contained
      within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n
      \ In the [2021 Irish IREL consortium\\n  agreement](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/)\\n
      \ with Springer Nature, Irish institutions covered by that agreement\\n  will
      pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access, which if we convert that\\n  from
      Euros to USD is **\\\\$2727.80 per article**.\\n- Another interesting comparator
      group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access
      journals**. The SN whitepaper\\n  chose to provide analysis exclusively of 'hybrid'
      journals. A suitable\\n  physics journal that enables open access at the journal
      for all\\n  articles is *SciPost Physics*. According to [their\\n  data](https://scipost.org/finances/apex){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\n
      \ data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"}, it costs them about\\n
      \ **620 euros per article (\\\\~ \\\\$700 USD)**, and their model is such that\\n
      \ there is no author-facing charge (no APC).\\n\\nSo, policymakers; when faced
      with a choice of enabling public access to\\nresearch via 'green' routes such
      as arXiv or fully open access journals\\nsuch as *SciPost Physics* or hybrid
      'gold' routes such as SpringerNature\\nhybrid journals which would you choose?
      On the basis of the evidence,\\nboth what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick
      in their report and data\\nexternal to that, in a world where money is in limited
      supply, it's\\nclear to me that green open access and fully open access journals
      are\\nbetter options. Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the\\ndata
      and methods, always come out as [the most\\nexpensive](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"}\\nand
      the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards. Spending\\nmoney on
      hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature's own data (!)\\nactually demonstrates
      this.\\n\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"updated_at\":1706096085,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
      newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
      consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot get
      assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
      justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\" but
      without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than the
      overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose self-cites
      on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion of category
      rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
      journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
      \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
      \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
      \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
      \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
      the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
      noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
      Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
      \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
      have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles from
      both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
      over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore [recent
      work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
      (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
      data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
      for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore very
      well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics journals
      is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles cite quite
      a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
      at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
      *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
      to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
      published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
      Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics services
      called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
      indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
      For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
      *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
      case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International Journal
      of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer and
      easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
      ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
      else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
      for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
      in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
      Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
      developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
      and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to assess
      the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes, if a researcher
      publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122 then
      it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper in a journal that has
      not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122 by Clarivate then
      that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that researcher.\\n\\nThe
      [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
      already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits Journal
      Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould actually
      call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI would encourage
      all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists, and biologists
      in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit analytics
      company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation committees
      to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially given that
      the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
      and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
      to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
      might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
      of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
      Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
      making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals thereby
      removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives
      of researchers.\\n\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"updated_at\":1701022623,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1731078596,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      going on here. I think it\u2019s Clarivate that has problems, not eLife.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From
      my perspective, the tension between innovation in research publishing and Clarivate\u2019s
      wish to demonstrate some kind of arbitrary \u2018selectivity\u2019 has been
      bubbling along for over a decade now. Researchers &amp; research funders are
      getting to grips with the affordances of digitality, trying new processes and
      discovering that some processes &amp; workflows result in better outcomes in
      terms of rigour, financial cost, transparency, and/or a reduction in research
      waste. I\u2019m thinking particularly about transparency of process and timing
      of process. Digitality allows for the traditional pre-digital publishing process
      to be <a href=\\\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full\\\">decoupled</a>
      and re-ordered.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 2024, whilst not yet \u201Cthe default\u201D,
      it is not uncommon in some disciplines to find research being published before
      peer-review, and <em>then</em> sent for some kind of peer-review <em>after</em>
      being published online. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201CPublish->Review->Curate\u201D
      model. <a href=\\\"https://asapbio.org/understanding-the-publish-review-curate-prc-model-of-scholarly-communication\\\">ASAPbio</a>
      have a nice explainer of the PRC model.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I infer that Clarivate
      / Web of Science doesn\u2019t seem to like the PRC model. I don\u2019t base
      this on wild supposition, it is based on what I can observe from the growing
      fleet of journals that are now operating a PRC-only model and are excluded from
      Clarivate indexing:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\">\\n<li><em>F1000Research</em>

      are well known for selling access to academic journal articles, so what&#8217;s
      the big deal here?<br><br>Well&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen alternative versions of
      this exact same article available in different places on the internet that appear
      to be the journal Version of Record, and in this Version of Record the article
      is clearly marked in the footer with &#8220;This is an open access article under
      the CC BY license.&#8221;<br><br>One place you can see this for your own eyes
      is at <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695905/\\\">NCBI
      PubMed Central</a> (PMC), screenshot below. The version available at PMC is
      not a &#8216;green&#8217; OA copy, it is not an author accepted manuscript.
      It is the Version of Record and it is marked as both &#8220;open access&#8221;
      and licensed under CC BY by the <em>publisher</em>, and this was certainly not
      added by PMC. PMC just display what they get. Can the Version of Record of a
      single article be both &#8220;open access&#8221; + CC BY on one platform and
      paywalled access + &#8220;all rights reserved&#8221; on another? That is quite

      is certainly not necessarily <em>illegal</em> to sell access to open access
      articles. But I do wonder about the ethics of all of this. Is this an intended
      new revenue stream for Elsevier? To sell open access articles pay-per-view,
      and hope no-one notices the dubious ethics of this practice, whilst they rake
      in the money? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How many other people have been tricked into
      purchasing access to open access articles? How much money has Elsevier made
      in the past 10 years from selling &#8220;open access&#8221; articles to readers
      &#8211; precisely against the basic ethos of the phrase?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In
      late 2014 Elsevier fessed-up to <a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151118042606/https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">incorrectly
      selling about $70,000 USD worth of pay-per-views to customers wanting to read
      open access articles</a> (and I note that the web page on Elsevier&#8217;s website
      documenting this apology seems to have been moved, or taken down, and thus I
      have to point you to an archived copy at the Internet Archive. Hmmm&#8230;).
      I think Elsevier, and preferably an external independent auditor need to take
      a hard look again at Elsevier&#8217;s pay-per-view sales records &#8211; are
      they all legit?<br><br>I also repeat my statement from 2017: <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">hybrid

      to the CLOCKSS <a href=\\\"https://clockss.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CLOCKSS-Participating-Publisher-Agreement-2024.pdf\\\">standard
      participating agreement</a>, the CLOCKSS Board will release archived content
      if the archived content is determined in good faith by the Board &#8220;&#8230;to
      be unavailable from any publisher for at least six consecutive months.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A
      calendar month may contain<strong>&nbsp;28 to 31 calendar days</strong>, the
      average is 30.437. If we are generous and assume 30.437 days, then the &#8220;six
      months&#8221; referred to in CLOCKSS agreement translates into 182.622 calendar
      days. 193 days is greater than 182 days and so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS
      have chosen not to publicly release <em>Heterocycles</em> yet. Who are CLOCKSS
      serving and who&#8217;s interests do they represent?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My first
      question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore &#8211; why was the journal
      not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously unavailable? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
      contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of unavailability
      (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not yet been briefed about
      <em>Heterocycles</em> at this point in time! Remarkable! Where is the sense
      of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that every single day that the journal
      content remains offline creates harm to the citation potential of the articles
      contained within the journal. Causing harm to individuals (authors), research
      performing organisations, and research funding organisations (at the least).
      The content must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any delay in excess
      of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go beyond the minimum period
      stated in the contract (and six months is way way too long in my opinion). CLOCKSS
      needs to be held accountable for this choice to delay the release of the 17,000+
      <em>Heterocycles</em> journal articles, some of which were only published recently,
      right up into 2023!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I am rather worried about the current
      governance setup of CLOCKSS &#8211; the <a href=\\\"https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/\\\">CLOCKSS
      board</a> is rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who
      is there to represent the interests of authors who have published in these journals?
      Who is there to represent the interests of patients who have been experimented
      on, and the results of those experiments published in journals archived in CLOCKSS?
      [There are medical journals archived in CLOCKSS]. Who is there to represent
      the interests of charities &amp; taxpayers who by some estimates fund approximately
      80% of academic research?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than just point the finger,
      I have offered to join the CLOCKSS board to see if I can add some ideas from
      within.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>CLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word &#8220;community&#8221;
      on their website, but I infer they define their community as exclusively just
      publishers and librarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink has written a great
      post recently about how the term <a href=\\\"https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/\\\">&#8220;community&#8221;
      has been co-opted</a>. I fundamentally disagree that publishers and librarians
      are the <em>only</em> stakeholders in published scholarship. I see scholarship
      as a global public good. This is also <a href=\\\"https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/\\\">the
      position of the International Science Council</a> and others. I really think
      there needs to be a wider selection of people involved in the governance &amp;
      decision-making at CLOCKSS.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Clause
      4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit vague: &#8220;Released
      Content use terms and restrictions will be determined by an accompanying Creative
      Commons license (or equivalent license) chosen either by Publisher or, if Publisher
      fails to respond within thirty (30) days following receipt by it of the notice
      described above, by the CLOCKSS Board.&#8221;<br><br>When CLOCKSS finally gets
      around to releasing <em>Heterocycles</em> from darkness, which exact Creative
      Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board choose? OASPA and many other organisations
      <a href=\\\"https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/\\\">recommend CC BY</a>. If
      the CLOCKSS Board chooses CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND it
      would hamper re-use of the journal content in important Wikimedia projects such
      as <a href=\\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing\\\">Wikimedia
      Commons</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>CLOCKSS provides access, not just preservation</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If
      and when CLOCKSS does release <em>Heterocycles</em>, it will more than double
      the current number of articles that CLOCKSS provides access to, which is merely
      ~13,000 articles at the moment. CLOCKSS will increasingly become a publication
      platform that provides access to research that people want &amp; need to read.
      CLOCKSS is not just a digital preservation service &#8211; it is an access provider
      too. I wonder if CLOCKSS has forgotten about the access part? I look forward
      to the day when CLOCKSS finally decides to publicly release <em>Heterocycles</em>
      to the world, but as of this moment, I regret to say I am still waiting and
      it is unclear why there is such a delay beyond the 182 day minimum&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"updated_at\":1718106643,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1741035297,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      the entire content of a &#8220;key&#8221; chemistry journal called <em>Heterocycles</em>,
      with over 17,000 articles in it, from 1973 to 2023, has been knocked offline
      due to what the publisher vaguely describes as &#8220;various circumstances&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
      journal has been unavailable to access online since December 2023, which means
      the content has been offline for four or five months now! Dalmeet Singh Chawla
      (2024) has written an excellent piece about this debacle for the magazine <em>Chemistry
      World</em>. I&#8217;d recommend you <a href=\\\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/a-key-chemistry-journal-disappeared-from-the-web-others-are-at-risk/4019265.article\\\">read
      it</a> before coming back to read my post here.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The good news
      is the content isn&#8217;t completely lost. A not-for-profit organisation supposedly
      dedicated to digital preservation of scholarly content, called CLOCKSS ought
      to have a copy of every single digital article that has been published in <em>Heterocycles</em>.
      However, recent research by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst dark
      archives like CLOCKSS preserve journal content at a title-level, when this is
      checked at an <em>article-level </em>it can be observed that actual digital
      preservation of journals at the article-level by a dark archive can be patchy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thanks
      to the accompanying website for Eve&#8217;s (2024) article, we can examine the
      <a href=\\\"https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29\\\">exact
      article-level preservation status</a> of a sample of a thousand articles from
      <em>Heterocycles</em>. All of Eve&#8217;s sample for <em>Heterocycles</em> are
      either &#8220;preserved&#8221; in CLOCKSS or &#8220;preserved (in progress)&#8221;
      at CLOCKSS. Eve&#8217;s work also reveals that incomplete / patchy selections
      of <em>Heterocycles</em> articles are preserved at HathiTrust, Internet Archive,
      and OCUL Scholars Portal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, I hope CLOCKSS does have a complete
      digital copy of the journal, but the question is: will CLOCKSS make it available?
      This all depends on CLOCKSS assessment of whether a &#8220;trigger event&#8221;
      has occurred here. From the information given on the CLOCKSS website it seems
      that the definition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation. If a
      title is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer providing access
      to the content AND there are no successor interests or reversion or transfer
      of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make their copies available online
      for all to read. From what the executive director of CLOCKSS says in the <em>Chemistry
      World</em> interview, it seems CLOCKSS are choosing to wait for the publisher
      of <em>Heterocycles</em> to find a successor. Alicia Wise is quoted as saying:
      &#8220;we will be in a position to make it available should they not find a
      successor organisation to look after it&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\\"has-large-font-size\\\"
      id=\\\"EthicalDilemma\\\"><strong>Ethical Dilemma</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Herein
      lies the ethical dilemma&#8230; how long should CLOCKSS wait for the publisher
      of <em>Heterocycles</em> to find a business successor? Over 17,000 journal articles
      have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS cannot and should not wait
      forever &#8211; it is not ethical to wait for too long &#8211; it would be unfair
      on all the authors of the content, the research funders of the content, and
      the readers who need to read what is published in it. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I am
      troubled by the lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making here &#8211;
      who decides how long CLOCKSS should wait for business successors, before declaring
      a trigger event? I am concerned about possible conflicts of interest that might
      creep in here too, for instance <em>Heterocycles</em> has a longstanding relationship
      with Elsevier. Elsevier were the official distributor of <em>Heterocycles</em>
      in all countries of the world, except for Japan (<a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles\\\">source</a>).
      In my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a &#8216;business
      successor&#8217; to take over <em>Heterocycles</em> and extract rent from it,
      for profit. The current executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise who is
      well known for her time in employment at Elsevier as its &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115\\\">Director
      of Universal Access</a>&#8220;. Any extra delay in declaring this a &#8220;trigger
      event&#8221; at CLOCKSS could be construed as buying time for a business deal
      to arrange a successor. <br><br>My personal feeling here is that 4 months is
      plenty of time. CLOCKSS current policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses
      and business interests. The needs of authors, readers, research funders and
      research institutions are ignored. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Put yourself in the shoes
      of an author of a recent article, published at <em>Heterocycles</em>: you&#8217;ve
      spent 2 years doing some research, got it through peer review, it&#8217;s published
      in <em>Heterocycles</em> in 2023 and now the journal is completely offline and
      no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber institutions) can access / read / cite
      the digital version of your article \U0001F643</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And CLOCKSS
      just sits there and just says &#8216;well we <em>could</em> provide digital
      access to the articles&#8217;, but we won&#8217;t because of business interests\u2026
      I would be hopping mad!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For instance: &#8220;Synthesis of
      Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones Catalyzed by Sodium Cyclamate&#8221; authored by Ziba
      Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh Kiyani and published in <em>Heterocycles</em> in 2023,
      &nbsp;pp.&nbsp;1187-1197, with the DOI: <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859\\\">10.3987/com-23-14859</a>
      .  Won&#8217;t this clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work
      if people can&#8217;t access the digital copy? If you can&#8217;t read it, you
      can&#8217;t cite it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I know that some libraries hold print
      runs of <em>Heterocycles</em>, <a href=\\\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914\\\">WorldCat</a>
      data (if reliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most universities
      around the world definitely do not have print copies of this journal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p
      class=\\\"has-large-font-size\\\" id=\\\"Conclusions\\\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over
      17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4 months and CLOCKSS
      is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a &#8220;trigger event&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
      think research funders, researchers, and research institutions need to look
      very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research &#8211; the old
      way seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of the research community.
      As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023), openly-licensed journal publication
      provides the resilience we need when journal publishing businesses fail, for
      whatever reason. &#8220;All rights reserved&#8221; content, published behind
      a paywall with a subscription like <em>Heterocycles</em> creates a lot of headaches
      and heartaches when they fail. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\\\"has-large-font-size\\\"

      December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in <a href=\\\"https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals\\\"><em>Science</em>
      magazine</a> [1], that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication
      scams whereby authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have their
      work published on a website that looks like a real scholarly journal but is
      in fact not a proper journal, merely an impersonation of one. Scopus was thoroughly
      caught-out with some excellent, well-documented work by Anna Albakina [2]. Kudos
      to Anna! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the <em>Science</em> article explains, the scammers:
      &#8220;&#8230;.managed to get Scopus to list a URL other than the real journal\u2019s&#8230;&#8221;
      , I have heard nothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation
      as to how this happened. Isn&#8217;t it a very important and basic part of their
      job to get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?<br><br>One
      amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than investigating the
      issue and implementing new processes to do a better job of it &#8211; they&#8217;ve
      actually just decided to completely abandon doing that particular job! On the
      18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message on their official blog (yes, I checked
      the URL, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;hijacked&#8221; blog, this <em>is</em> the
      official Scopus blog &#8211; see Scopus, it&#8217;s not hard to check the URL
      provenance!) to say: &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages\\\">Scopus
      will remove the Source Homepage links from all Source details pages</a>&#8220;.
      [3]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post
      is&#8230; hmmm. On the one hand, they want to reassure readers that &#8220;Maintaining
      the integrity of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of paramount
      importance to us&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Ensuring research integrity is a top
      priority for us&#8230;&#8221; but the actual thing this post is announcing is
      that they have been caught-out and now they no longer wish to bear the responsibility
      of pointing accurately to where a peer-reviewed journal exists on the web (the
      &#8216;Source Homepage&#8217; in Scopus-speak). Disapprovingly, I also note
      that Albakina&#8217;s excellent work that almost certainly prompted this, is
      not mentioned or cited anywhere in this corporate blog post \u2639 .  I wonder
      if any of the Scopus customers were consulted about this change in service?
      Aren&#8217;t the customers paying for this information service? To suddenly
      take it away is rather interesting&#8230;<br><br>I am thus entirely unsurprised
      to read that major organisations including the French National Centre for Scientific
      Research (in French: <em>Centre national de la recherche scientifique</em>,
      CNRS) have recently discontinued their subscriptions to Scopus [4]. If Scopus
      isn&#8217;t willing to risk doing the useful and difficult work of checking
      provenance and integrity &#8211; why should research institutions keep paying
      them?<br><br>Pleasingly, I note that other organizations including the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
      of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ), are well-placed to fill the abdication from
      responsibility by Scopus here. DOAJ links to the official website URL for each
      and every journal listed in DOAJ. This a valuable service. This comes with a
      certain risk but I do hope DOAJ carry-on with this practice, as it <em>is</em>
      good value-add for the global community. Someone needs to take responsibility
      for where journals are, online!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Does anyone care to predict
      what value-add service Scopus will arbitrarily stop offering, without consulting
      customers, in 2024? Will Scopus spiral into a managed decline like Twitter?
      Who knows? But I&#8217;ll be watching, that&#8217;s for sure&#8230; </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>

      data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
      data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per line.
      A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the data
      to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include the word
      &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row. [e.g. <em>grep
      -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But of
      course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word &#8216;Society&#8217;
      in the journal title but is not actually published-for or -by a learned society.
      Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily call themselves a society
      using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly, many learned societies
      operate in countries that use languages other than English and thus the name
      of the society is often registered in other languages and even non-Latin script.
      To do a better job of attempting to find all the society-affiliated journals
      in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware manner. I looked at the
      <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata item on &#8216;learned
      society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations of the concept in

      societies and associations, I ended up finding over 1600 journals which both
      charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND are associated with a learned
      society. For transparency, I have uploaded this list of society associated,

      probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
      access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
      available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202

      got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
      event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
      above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
      Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
      for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
      the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was unprecedented.
      People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important knowledge
      were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I like how <a
      href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
      put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
      (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
      to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
      journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
      (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
      interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
      the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the content
      in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help students
      and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because of the
      copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers, for their
      paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
      open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to
      in the title of this post. The key differentiators here in open access systems,
      that make open access more resilient to downtime overall are a) availability
      on multiple independent platforms and b) open licencing that makes it legally
      easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools such as Google
      Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a>
      can signpost the way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay
      openly accessible 24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
      and thus easy to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual
      repositories or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
      recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
      maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
      that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
      \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
      downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
      natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
      out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights reserved&#8217;
      content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major downtime events at
      academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

      spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had as a peer-reviewer,
      reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was deeply insufficient.
      I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I reviewed, or the full content
      of my peer review report but the gist of it was (quoting from my report, my
      words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
      [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to draw
      conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population of ~4594
      SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size (152/4594).
      I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least a 10% sample
      (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage such as Ghane
      et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed in DOAJ (DOAJ
      at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al (2020) achieved
      a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore, the
      choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in a non-random
      and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download data on.
      This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one possible bias
      introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose a journal with
      a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross
      Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR the experimental design
      was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors put a lot of work into
      it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid, given the problems of
      their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience as a reviewer was
      like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too late to stop the accident.
      To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable experimental design
      at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require throwing away much
      of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear to me that a lot of
      researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch, research on research,
      journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever you call it. That&#8217;s
      great. But I implore folks to seriously consider getting their experimental
      design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study, and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em>
      is one of the communities that will provide that service for you, for free!
      </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch,
      to catch improperly designed studies before they get carried out, written-up,
      and submitted. Reducing research waste AND increasing the quality of research
      that ends-up getting published &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save
      you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"updated_at\":1706095625,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1741062762,\"authors\":[{\"url\":

      disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
      with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll immediately
      notice with all three of these citation distributions is that they are heavily
      skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
      I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
      any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a strongly
      skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1, the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221;
      set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has a skew of 5.4.
      All three citation distributions are highly skewed. This level of skew is absolutely
      to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed the typical skew of journal citation
      distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

      skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that you
      should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution with
      the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper have
      chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
      of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the median.
      Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which is 4
      citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6 citations
      for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

      their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
      help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19 of
      the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a normal
      scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations are
      not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
      in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green OA)
      and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
      No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
      their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could have
      otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude who
      knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.) There&#8217;s
      a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology with respect
      to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories. <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
      hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
      </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance of
      an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal (their
      &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article which has
      a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication date,
      gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported open access
      benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison where the
      &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six months extra
      to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence of green OA author
      manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
      Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
      embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
      the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
      or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed to
      factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with &#8220;Gold
      OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from funders with
      an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say non-grant funded
      research, or from grant funded research from a funder that does not pay for
      open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the results. What this
      result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for research that tends
      to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.)
      Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most expensive way possible
      of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
      the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
      for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
      There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
      OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN hybrid
      journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid
      gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow
      garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth $2780 per
      article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open access journals of which
      <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there
      are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a> are typically both lower in price and often
      higher in citation performance per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost
      Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
      1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
      their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
      and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
      Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

      is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
      journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
      albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
      if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\"><li>(1)
      the author(s), institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness

      class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\"><li>(2) the journal grants a fee waiver and gives

      class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\"><li>(3) the journal just turns off the paywall on
      an individual article at whim without author-side payment, without a Creative
      Commons license, and importantly without any assurance of permanence of the
      turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze
      OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature use the results of various
      analyses to claim, presumably to an audience of governments, policymakers, and
      researchers that they should focus their efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid
      gold OA journals rather than green OA infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts

      versions can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong
      a reach or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation
      of subscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes
      to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold
      OA should be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
      OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to do
      their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
      intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019 , let
      alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put, the
      experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or
      logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
      with any analysis it&#8217;s always good to look at the data sources. In the
      SpringerNature white paper they look at full original research papers (excluding
      other items found within journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction
      Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries,
      &#8220;Other Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera)
      that are first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that
      is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is
      that lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
      are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
      to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles in
      the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues but
      were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s not
      a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I first
      looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
      Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the number
      of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the calendar
      year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal included
      in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily
      excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in this
      journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the
      selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
      class=\\\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\\\"><p>Only
      those primary research articles where all the necessary metadata was available<br>were
      included in the analysis:<br>\u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were
      identified as being published in a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022
      68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable
      THE institutional ranking and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two
      factors left a final data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
      readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
      set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
      year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
      is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
      authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
      Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
      to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
      higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
      bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
      picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
      vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
      with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
      I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
      data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
      published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
      Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
      is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
      , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
      University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
      in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
      included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have whittled-down
      the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not
      appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via email,
      I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs of the initial
      sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from Mithu Lucraft was<em>
      &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset. If you wish to apply
      for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look into the appropriate
      contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t help but note
      that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
      from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list of
      DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply for
      an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing only
      when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
      agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate the
      list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals in
      2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
      closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
      papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking that
      has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into a subject-area
      e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset that the median number
      of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when assessed in November 2021,
      this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years and 10 months [if published
      2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months [if published 2018-12-31] ),
      in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\"><li>*

      (across n=315 articles)</li><li>* that is paywalled at the hybrid SN journal
      but is also publicly accessible via an arxiv preprint copy is <strong>3 citations</strong>
      (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
      nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
      is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
      by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at
      the fully open access journal <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\">SciPost
      Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
      citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
      the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA as
      routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
      open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
      a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
      citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
      130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the &#8216;open
      access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis points out
      that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217; SN
      whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
      then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\\\"wp-block-list\\\"><li>arXiv\u2019s

      that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
      that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
      institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals, hybrid
      gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
      to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
      median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
      is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
      gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
      agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC
      registry</a>. In the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/\\\">2021
      Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
      covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
      which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
      interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
      of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to provide
      analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable physics journal
      that enables open access at the journal for all articles is <em>SciPost Physics</em>.
      According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
      data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their data</a>, it costs them
      about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>, and their model is
      such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
      policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
      via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
      as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
      hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both what
      SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external to that,
      in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to me that green
      open access and fully open access journals are better options. Hybrid journals
      no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always come out as
      <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
      data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
      most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
      Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
      data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"updated_at\":1706096085,\"registered_at\":0,\"indexed_at\":1741115535,\"authors\":[{\"url\":
