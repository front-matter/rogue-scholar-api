        December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in [*Science*\\nmagazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals)\\n\\\\[1\\\\],
        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        has the word\\n'Society' in the journal title but is not actually published-for

        many learned societies operate in countries that use\\nlanguages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often\\nregistered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better\\njob of attempting to find all
        the society-affiliated journals in DOAJ,\\none needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the\\n[Wikidata item on 'learned\\nsociety'](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824)

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        convenience, the relatively few\\nexceptional papers with citations \\\\>40
        are not plotted. One thing that I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all
        three of these citation\\ndistributions is that they are heavily skewed. With
        the help of the R\\npackage\\n'[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas

SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir

        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there

        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof

        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British
        Medical Association\\nHouse, London). They claim on both the flyers and the
        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means
        Article Processing Charge, a\\npublishing service for academic customers\\\\]
        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of
        \\\\$5000 advertised. They\\nalso report these prices without VAT added-on,
        this is also misleading\\nas this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing
        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their
        website\\nthe same day and found thirteen journals published at Elsevier,
        that by\\nElsevier's own price list charge \\\\$5200 US dollars, not including
        VAT.\\nThose journals are: *Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell

        December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in [*Science*\\nmagazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals)\\n\\\\[1\\\\],
        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,

        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        convenience, the relatively few\\nexceptional papers with citations \\\\>40
        are not plotted. One thing that I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all
        three of these citation\\ndistributions is that they are heavily skewed. With

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny

SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir

        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with

        \ \\n  \\nAll that SpringerNature have demonstrated with their white paper
        is\\nalarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility and\\ntransparency.
        Given how popular measures like Clarivate's Journal Impact\\nFactor are (which

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.

        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For

        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n

        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied

        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from

        that you felt that\_Elsevier's\\nadvertising was misleading because it did
        not accurately reflect the\\nprice range of their products and they do not
        quote prices with VAT.\_\\nPlease note that we have only reviewed the leaflet
        which you forwarded\\nto us, because we considered that the sign constituted
        point of sale\\nmaterial, which is not covered by our Codes.\\n\\nWe have
        concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the\\nAdvertising Rules
        that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we\\nhave taken steps
        to address this.\\n\\nWe\_have explained\_your concerns to the advertiser
        and provided guidance\\nto them on the areas that require attention, together
        with advice on how\\nto ensure that their advertising complies with the Codes.\\n\\nComments
        such as yours help us to understand the issues that matter to\\nconsumers
        and we will keep a record of your complaint on file for use in\\nfuture monitoring.

        am thrilled that the Advertising Standards Authority has officially\\nupheld
        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems\\nwith Elsevier's
        business practices, and that of other academic\\npublishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are\\nnot immune to regulation --
        they must abide by the law at all times. The\\npunishment for now is just
        a slap-on-the-wrist but if they are\\nconsistently caught misadvertising,
        stronger punishments can and would\\nbe meted out. Perhaps now is the time
        for more regulators to start\\nseriously investigating complaints about these
        richly profitable\\npublishing companies with [dubious business\\npractices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier)?

        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,

        downloaded journal-level data in .csv format from the DOAJ [public\\ndata

        the .csv file, after subsetting the data to exclude APC-OA\\njournals, reveals
        that 947 lines of the file include the word 'society',\\nalbeit one of these

        many learned societies operate in countries that use\\nlanguages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often\\nregistered in other languages

        the society-affiliated journals in DOAJ,\\none needs to search in a multilingual-aware

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny

        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky

        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able

        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and

        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        'Going for Gold' SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly\\nexecuted

        \ from the world's research institutions\\\\]\\n- By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature
        physics journals, hybrid gold APCs\\n  vary from \\\\$4480 in *The Astronomy

        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n

        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access

        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        I saw Elsevier engage-in with their marketing spiel\\nat a recent conference.\\n\\nThe

        February 2018\\n\\n**Your complaint:**  \\nElsevier, a large academic publishing
        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British
        Medical Association\\nHouse, London). They claim on both the flyers and the
        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means
        Article Processing Charge, a\\npublishing service for academic customers\\\\]
        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of
        \\\\$5000 advertised. They\\nalso report these prices without VAT added-on,
        this is also misleading\\nas this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing
        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their
        website\\nthe same day and found thirteen journals published at Elsevier,
        that by\\nElsevier's own price list charge \\\\$5200 US dollars, not including
        VAT.\\nThose journals are: *Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell
        Host\\n& Microbe, Cell Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current\\nBiology,

        December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in [*Science*\\nmagazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals)\\n\\\\[1\\\\],
        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many\\nof

        of these services, and many others (do we even know how many?) are\\nstill
        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        convenience, the relatively few\\nexceptional papers with citations \\\\>40
        are not plotted. One thing that I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all
        three of these citation\\ndistributions is that they are heavily skewed. With
        the help of the R\\npackage\\n'[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny
        decent statistician will tell you that you should not represent the\\ncentral

        I concerned about the 2 citation difference in medians, over a period\\nof
        \\\\~3 years, between \\\"EarlyV\\\" (Green OA) and \\\"Gold OA\\\" (expensive\\nhybrid
        gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?\\n\\n1.) SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir
        sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they\\ncould have
        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with
        *SciPost Physics* in\\n[Part 1 of this\\nseries](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}.
        \ \\n  \\nAll that SpringerNature have demonstrated with their white paper
        is\\nalarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility and\\ntransparency.
        Given how popular measures like Clarivate's Journal Impact\\nFactor are (which
        is also calculated in a [statistically illiterate\\nwa](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"}y),\\nperhaps
        SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway, despite the\\nmethodological

        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof

        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report

        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        and Astrophysics Review* to just\\n  \\\\$2690 in *Celestial Mechanics and
        Dynamical Astronomy*, **the median\\n  list price per article to enable open

        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n

        \ with Springer Nature, Irish institutions covered by that agreement\\n  will
        pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access, which if we convert that\\n  from

        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access
        journals**. The SN whitepaper\\n  chose to provide analysis exclusively of
        'hybrid' journals. A suitable\\n  physics journal that enables open access
        at the journal for all\\n  articles is *SciPost Physics*. According to [their\\n
        \ data](https://scipost.org/finances/apex){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\n  data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"},

        their model is such that\\n  there is no author-facing charge (no APC).\\n\\nSo,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to\\nresearch
        via 'green' routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals\\nsuch as *SciPost
        Physics* or hybrid 'gold' routes such as SpringerNature\\nhybrid journals
        which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence,\\nboth what SpringerNature

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British

        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means

        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of

        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their

        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed

        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national

        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the

        British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many\\nof

        of these services, and many others (do we even know how many?) are\\nstill
        offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can probably\\nlive without
        registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about\\naccess to my PhD thesis?
        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy
        thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202 . In more normal times it would\\nbe

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        *\\\"...this \\\\[name of OA journal redacted\\\\] manuscript has an inadequate\\n>

        to just a 3.3% sample size (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors\\n>
        couldn't have taken at least a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior\\n> work

        like arriving at the scene of a car\\ncrash six months too late to stop the

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny

SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir

        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and

        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof

        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their

        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot

        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"

        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of

        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals

        I saw Elsevier engage-in with their marketing spiel\\nat a recent conference.\\n\\nThe
        content of my submission is below:\\n\\n**Name:\_**Ross Mounce\\n\\n**Ad\_type:**\_Leaflets,
        flyers and circulars\\n\\n**Brand/product:**\_Elsevier\\n\\n**Date:** 26th
        February 2018\\n\\n**Your complaint:**  \\nElsevier, a large academic publishing
        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British
        Medical Association\\nHouse, London). They claim on both the flyers and the
        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means
        Article Processing Charge, a\\npublishing service for academic customers\\\\]
        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of
        \\\\$5000 advertised. They\\nalso report these prices without VAT added-on,
        this is also misleading\\nas this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing
        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their
        website\\nthe same day and found thirteen journals published at Elsevier,
        that by\\nElsevier's own price list charge \\\\$5200 US dollars, not including
        VAT.\\nThose journals are: *Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell
        Host\\n& Microbe, Cell Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current\\nBiology,
        Developmental Cell, Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron*, and\\n*Structure*.
        For reference I have attached a PDF of Elsevier's online\\nprice list which
        I downloaded from Elsevier's official website\\nhere:\_[https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing](https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing){target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\nrel=\\\"noopener

        am thrilled that the Advertising Standards Authority has officially\\nupheld
        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems\\nwith Elsevier's
        business practices, and that of other academic\\npublishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are\\nnot immune to regulation --
        they must abide by the law at all times. The\\npunishment for now is just
        a slap-on-the-wrist but if they are\\nconsistently caught misadvertising,
        stronger punishments can and would\\nbe meted out. Perhaps now is the time
        for more regulators to start\\nseriously investigating complaints about these
        richly profitable\\npublishing companies with [dubious business\\npractices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier)?

        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        \\\\~3 years, between \\\"EarlyV\\\" (Green OA) and \\\"Gold OA\\\" (expensive\\nhybrid
        gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?\\n\\n1.) SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir
        sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they\\ncould have
        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky

        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        February 2018\\n\\n**Your complaint:**  \\nElsevier, a large academic publishing
        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British
        Medical Association\\nHouse, London). They claim on both the flyers and the
        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means
        Article Processing Charge, a\\npublishing service for academic customers\\\\]
        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of
        \\\\$5000 advertised. They\\nalso report these prices without VAT added-on,
        this is also misleading\\nas this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing
        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their
        website\\nthe same day and found thirteen journals published at Elsevier,
        that by\\nElsevier's own price list charge \\\\$5200 US dollars, not including
        VAT.\\nThose journals are: *Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell

        December last year, it was widely publicized e.g. in [*Science*\\nmagazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals)\\n\\\\[1\\\\],
        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby
        authors pay to bypass real scholarly peer review and have\\ntheir work published
        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe
        corporate double-speak in operation in this blog post is... hmmm. On\\nthe
        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity
        of Scopus and its high-quality, curated content is of\\nparamount importance
        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere
        in this\\ncorporate blog post \u2639 . I wonder if any of the Scopus customers
        were\\nconsulted about this change in service? Aren't the customers paying
        for\\nthis information service? To suddenly take it away is rather\\ninteresting...
        \ \\n  \\nI am thus entirely unsurprised to read that major organisations\\nincluding
        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        lines is the header row. \\\\[e.g. *grep -i 'society'\\nDOAJdata.csv \\\\|

        I want people to be able to read this. Is it\\nstill available online anywhere?\\n\\nMy

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
        can signpost the way to where these\\nalternative copies live. Research can
        stay openly accessible 24/7, 365\\ndays a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed
        and thus easy to host\\non multiple platforms.\\n\\nEven if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g.\\n[Michigan](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/)\\nrecently)
        experience some downtime through cyberattacks or 'unplanned\\nmaintainence',
        the global collective network of repositories can ensure\\nthat the scholarship
        remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different\\nlocations. **The next time
        you see a paywalled journal experiencing some\\nsignificant downtime, please
        let me know.** I think there are some very\\ninteresting natural obervation
        experiments that could be done around\\nthese events to tease out the differences
        in impact between\\nopen-licensed and 'all rights reserved' content. Does
        anyone maintain a\\nwiki or database of major downtime events at academic
        publishers? There\\nhave been quite a few already...\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        convenience, the relatively few\\nexceptional papers with citations \\\\>40
        are not plotted. One thing that I\\nhope you'll immediately notice with all
        three of these citation\\ndistributions is that they are heavily skewed. With
        the help of the R\\npackage\\n'[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the
        typical skew of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness\\nof\\nscience](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"}\\\".\\nAny
        decent statistician will tell you that you should not represent the\\ncentral

        gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?\\n\\n1.) SN massively\\n[cherry-picked](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}\\ntheir
        sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they\\ncould have
        otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose\\nto exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like.\\n\\n2.) There's a huge
        unaddressed flaw in the \\\"white paper\\\" methodology\\nwith respect to
        author manuscripts made publicly available at\\nrepositories. [SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an 'embargo' of either\\n6 months or 12\\nmonths](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"}\\ndepending
        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with
        *SciPost Physics* in\\n[Part 1 of this\\nseries](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"}.
        \ \\n  \\nAll that SpringerNature have demonstrated with their white paper
        is\\nalarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility and\\ntransparency.
        Given how popular measures like Clarivate's Journal Impact\\nFactor are (which
        is also calculated in a [statistically illiterate\\nwa](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"}y),\\nperhaps
        SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway, despite the\\nmethodological

        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology

        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and

        open access or at least public access to a version of a\\nresearch output
        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation
        advantage' (OACA) but a recent\\nmeta-analysis points out that most of them

        \ from the world's research institutions\\\\]\\n- By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature
        physics journals, hybrid gold APCs\\n  vary from \\\\$4480 in *The Astronomy

        Dynamical Astronomy*, **the median\\n  list price per article to enable open
        access in SN hybrid Physics\\n  journals is \\\\$2780**\\n- Alternatively,
        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n
        \ In the [2021 Irish IREL consortium\\n  agreement](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/)\\n
        \ with Springer Nature, Irish institutions covered by that agreement\\n  will
        pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access, which if we convert that\\n  from
        Euros to USD is **\\\\$2727.80 per article**.\\n- Another interesting comparator
        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is\\n  the existence of **fully open access
        journals**. The SN whitepaper\\n  chose to provide analysis exclusively of
        'hybrid' journals. A suitable\\n  physics journal that enables open access
        at the journal for all\\n  articles is *SciPost Physics*. According to [their\\n
        \ data](https://scipost.org/finances/apex){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\n  data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"},
        it costs them about\\n  **620 euros per article (\\\\~ \\\\$700 USD)**, and
        their model is such that\\n  there is no author-facing charge (no APC).\\n\\nSo,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to\\nresearch
        via 'green' routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals\\nsuch as *SciPost
        Physics* or hybrid 'gold' routes such as SpringerNature\\nhybrid journals
        which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence,\\nboth what SpringerNature
        cares to cherry-pick in their report and data\\nexternal to that, in a world
        where money is in limited supply, it's\\nclear to me that green open access
        and fully open access journals are\\nbetter options. Hybrid journals no matter
        how much you cherry-pick the\\ndata and methods, always come out as [the most\\nexpensive](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"}\\nand

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied

        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        company, have flyers and a large\\nposter, both containing the same information
        at the [Researcher to\\nReader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/) (British

        poster that \\\"Fact\\n\\\\#2: Our APC prices are value for money Our APC
        prices range from \\\\$150\\n-- \\\\$5000 US dollars...\\\" \\\\[APC means

        I believe this is false\\nadvertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        \\\\$5200 US dollars\\nas an APC. \\\\$5200 is greater than the maximum of

        this service would\\nhave to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should
        be displayed\\ninclusive of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention
        of the need\\nto pay VAT on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their

        am thrilled that the Advertising Standards Authority has officially\\nupheld
        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems\\nwith Elsevier's
        business practices, and that of other academic\\npublishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are\\nnot immune to regulation --
        they must abide by the law at all times. The\\npunishment for now is just
        a slap-on-the-wrist but if they are\\nconsistently caught misadvertising,
        stronger punishments can and would\\nbe meted out. Perhaps now is the time
        for more regulators to start\\nseriously investigating complaints about these
        richly profitable\\npublishing companies with [dubious business\\npractices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier)?
