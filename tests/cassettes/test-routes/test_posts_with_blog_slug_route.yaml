        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        the relatively few exceptional papers with citations &gt;40 are not plotted.
        One thing that I hope you\u2019ll immediately notice with all three of these
        citation distributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the
        R package \u2018<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>\u2018
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The \u201CNon-OA\u201D set has a skew of 8.1,
        the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set has a skew of 6.0, and the \u201CGold OA\u201D
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions \u201C<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\">the
        skewness of science</a>\u201C. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here\u2019s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for \u201CNon-OA\u201D and \u201CEarlyV\u201D and is 6 citations
        for \u201CGold OA\u201D):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/boxplots.png\\\"><img

        300w\\\" /></a></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To their credit, they do display a
        boxplot analysis of this data but I can\u2019t help but notice that they stick
        it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19 of the PDF! They choose a log-scale
        for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a normal scale, albeit that choice means
        that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am
        I concerned about the 2 citation difference in medians, over a period of ~3
        years, between \u201CEarlyV\u201D (Green OA) and \u201CGold OA\u201D (expensive
        hybrid gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN
        massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There\u2019s a huge unaddressed flaw in the \u201Cwhite paper\u201D methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an \u2019embargo\u2019 of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their \u201CGold OA\u201D), with the citation performance of an article which
        has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set much less time for the purported open
        access benefit to take effect. Effectively it\u2019s an unfair comparison
        where the \u201CGold OA\u201D set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a \u2018fairer\u2019 analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (\u201CGold\u201D)
        or at a repository (\u201CGreen\u201D).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed to
        factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        \u201CGold OA\u201D e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for \u2018cheaper\u2019 SN hybrid
        journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid
        gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did
        somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth
        $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open access journals
        of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at
        DOAJ</a> are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br /><br />All that SpringerNature have demonstrated
        with their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate\u2019s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,
        despite the methodological and statistical wrongness? As SPARC notes, the

        the relatively few exceptional papers with citations &gt;40 are not plotted.
        One thing that I hope you\u2019ll immediately notice with all three of these
        citation distributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the
        R package \u2018<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>\u2018
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The \u201CNon-OA\u201D set has a skew of 8.1,
        the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set has a skew of 6.0, and the \u201CGold OA\u201D
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions \u201C<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\">the
        skewness of science</a>\u201C. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here\u2019s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for \u201CNon-OA\u201D and \u201CEarlyV\u201D and is 6 citations
        for \u201CGold OA\u201D):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/boxplots.png\\\"><img

        boxplot analysis of this data but I can\u2019t help but notice that they stick
        it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19 of the PDF! They choose a log-scale
        for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a normal scale, albeit that choice means
        that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am
        I concerned about the 2 citation difference in medians, over a period of ~3
        years, between \u201CEarlyV\u201D (Green OA) and \u201CGold OA\u201D (expensive
        hybrid gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN
        massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There\u2019s a huge unaddressed flaw in the \u201Cwhite paper\u201D methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an \u2019embargo\u2019 of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their \u201CGold OA\u201D), with the citation performance of an article which
        has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set much less time for the purported open
        access benefit to take effect. Effectively it\u2019s an unfair comparison
        where the \u201CGold OA\u201D set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a \u2018fairer\u2019 analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (\u201CGold\u201D)
        or at a repository (\u201CGreen\u201D).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed to
        factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        \u201CGold OA\u201D e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for \u2018cheaper\u2019 SN hybrid
        journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid
        gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did
        somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth
        $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open access journals
        of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at
        DOAJ</a> are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br /><br />All that SpringerNature have demonstrated
        with their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate\u2019s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,
        despite the methodological and statistical wrongness? As SPARC notes, the

        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an

        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis

        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded because

        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN\u2019s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Only

        2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it is
        explicitly non-random \u2013 it excludes full research articles with corresponding

        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it\u2019s clear to me
        that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature\u2019s own

        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach

        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        \u2018open access citation advantage\u2019 (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This \u2018Going for Gold\u2019

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals. A suitable physics
        journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is <em>SciPost
        Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it\u2019s clear to me
        that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature\u2019s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly \u201Csuppressed\u201D   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this \u201Csuppression\u201D
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        \u201Canomalous citation patterns\u201D but without much further detail given
        for each of the journals other than the overall \u201C% Self-cites\u201D of
        the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate\u2019s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher \u2018Magnolia Press\u2019
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by

        target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from
        both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (\u201Cself-citation\u201D at the journal-level
        from Clarivate\u2019s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important \u2018megajournal\u2019 for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate\u2019s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called \u2018<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>\u2018 indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        \u2018high\u2019 journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual\u2019s research output. In some regimes, if a
        researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it \u2018counts\u2019, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not \u2018count\u2019 towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate\u2019s wacky \u201Csuppression\u201D might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate\u2019s decision making is, I would ask

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        Standards Authority</a> (ASA) about some blatant fibbing I saw Elsevier engage-in
        with their marketing spiel at a recent conference.</p>\\n<p>The content of
        my submission is below:</p>\\n<p><strong>Name:\_</strong>Ross Mounce</p>\\n<p><strong>Ad\_type:</strong>\_Leaflets,
        flyers and circulars</p>\\n<p><strong>Brand/product:</strong>\_Elsevier</p>\\n<p><strong>Date:
        </strong>26th February 2018</p>\\n<p><strong>Your complaint:</strong><br />\\nElsevier,
        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that \u201CFact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 \u2013 $5000 US dollars\u2026\u201D
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier\u2019s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier\u2019s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier\u2019s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.elsevier.com/__<wbr></wbr>data/promis_misc/j.custom97.<wbr></wbr>pdf</a></p>\\n<p>I
        attached images of the offending poster and flyers. Below is a photo I took
        of the misleading flyer:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flyer.jpg\\\"><img

        understand from your complaint that you felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising
        was misleading because it did not accurately reflect the price range of their
        products and they do not quote prices with VAT.\_ Please note that we have
        only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded to us, because we considered
        that the sign constituted point of sale material, which is not covered by
        our Codes.</p>\\n<p>We have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have
        breached the Advertising Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know
        that we have taken steps to address this.</p>\\n<p>We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p>Comments such as yours help us to understand
        the issues that matter to consumers and we will keep a record of your complaint
        on file for use in future monitoring. If you would like more information about

        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems with Elsevier\u2019s
        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation \u2013
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious
