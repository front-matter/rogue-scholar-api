        the relatively few exceptional papers with citations &gt;40 are not plotted.
        One thing that I hope you\u2019ll immediately notice with all three of these
        citation distributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the
        R package \u2018<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>\u2018
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The \u201CNon-OA\u201D set has a skew of 8.1,
        the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set has a skew of 6.0, and the \u201CGold OA\u201D
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions \u201C<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\">the
        skewness of science</a>\u201C. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here\u2019s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for \u201CNon-OA\u201D and \u201CEarlyV\u201D and is 6 citations
        for \u201CGold OA\u201D):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/boxplots.png\\\"><img

        300w\\\" /></a></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To their credit, they do display a
        boxplot analysis of this data but I can\u2019t help but notice that they stick
        it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19 of the PDF! They choose a log-scale
        for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a normal scale, albeit that choice means
        that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am
        I concerned about the 2 citation difference in medians, over a period of ~3
        years, between \u201CEarlyV\u201D (Green OA) and \u201CGold OA\u201D (expensive
        hybrid gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN
        massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There\u2019s a huge unaddressed flaw in the \u201Cwhite paper\u201D methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an \u2019embargo\u2019 of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their \u201CGold OA\u201D), with the citation performance of an article which
        has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set much less time for the purported open
        access benefit to take effect. Effectively it\u2019s an unfair comparison
        where the \u201CGold OA\u201D set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a \u2018fairer\u2019 analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (\u201CGold\u201D)
        or at a repository (\u201CGreen\u201D).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed to
        factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        \u201CGold OA\u201D e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for \u2018cheaper\u2019 SN hybrid
        journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid
        gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did
        somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth
        $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open access journals
        of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at
        DOAJ</a> are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br /><br />All that SpringerNature have demonstrated
        with their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate\u2019s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,
        despite the methodological and statistical wrongness? As SPARC notes, the
        lead author of the report is <a href=\\\"https://sparcopen.org/news/2021/trampling-on-green-in-a-rush-for-gold/\\\">SN\u2019s

        the relatively few exceptional papers with citations &gt;40 are not plotted.
        One thing that I hope you\u2019ll immediately notice with all three of these
        citation distributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the
        R package \u2018<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>\u2018
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The \u201CNon-OA\u201D set has a skew of 8.1,
        the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set has a skew of 6.0, and the \u201CGold OA\u201D
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions \u201C<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\">the
        skewness of science</a>\u201C. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here\u2019s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for \u201CNon-OA\u201D and \u201CEarlyV\u201D and is 6 citations
        for \u201CGold OA\u201D):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/boxplots.png\\\"><img

        boxplot analysis of this data but I can\u2019t help but notice that they stick
        it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19 of the PDF! They choose a log-scale
        for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a normal scale, albeit that choice means
        that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am
        I concerned about the 2 citation difference in medians, over a period of ~3
        years, between \u201CEarlyV\u201D (Green OA) and \u201CGold OA\u201D (expensive
        hybrid gold open access at the journal)? No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN
        massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There\u2019s a huge unaddressed flaw in the \u201Cwhite paper\u201D methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an \u2019embargo\u2019 of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their \u201CGold OA\u201D), with the citation performance of an article which
        has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the \u201CEarlyV\u201D set much less time for the purported open
        access benefit to take effect. Effectively it\u2019s an unfair comparison
        where the \u201CGold OA\u201D set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a \u2018fairer\u2019 analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (\u201CGold\u201D)
        or at a repository (\u201CGreen\u201D).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed to
        factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        \u201CGold OA\u201D e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for \u2018cheaper\u2019 SN hybrid
        journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid
        gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did
        somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth
        $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open access journals
        of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at
        DOAJ</a> are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br /><br />All that SpringerNature have demonstrated
        with their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate\u2019s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,
        despite the methodological and statistical wrongness? As SPARC notes, the

        is a \u2018hybrid\u2019 journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>\_\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it\u2019s always
        good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper they look
        at full original research papers (excluding other items found within journals
        such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices,
        Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, \u201COther Journals
        in Brief\u201D, \u201CProduct News\u201D , et cetera) that are first published
        online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to
        2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research
        articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded because
        they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a \u201C2018\u201D
        issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles in the SN whitepaper dataset
        that are in \u201C2019\u201D journal issues but were first published online
        in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That\u2019s not a complaint fwiw, just an
        observation\u2026]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I first looked at an exemplar SN
        hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN\u2019s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Only
        those primary research articles where all the necessary metadata was available<br
        />were included in the analysis:<br />\u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the
        articles were identified as being published in a<br />journal with an impact
        factor<br />\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles had a corresponding
        author that had an<br />identifiable THE institutional ranking and country.</p><p><br
        />The overlap between these two factors left a final data set of 60,567 records<br
        />incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful readers
        will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the set of
        full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar year
        2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it is
        explicitly non-random \u2013 it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what\u2019s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn\u2019t even correspond
        with the data they\u2019ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI:
        10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9) published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid
        journal, it has a Clarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author
        affiliation on this paper is \u201CGraduate School of Education, University
        of the Ryukyus, Japan\u201D , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can\u2019t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> \u201CI\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose\u201D</em>. I can\u2019t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        is a \u2018hybrid\u2019 journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>\_\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it\u2019s always
        good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper they look
        at full original research papers (excluding other items found within journals
        such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices,
        Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, \u201COther Journals
        in Brief\u201D, \u201CProduct News\u201D , et cetera) that are first published
        online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to
        2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research
        articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded because
        they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a \u201C2018\u201D
        issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles in the SN whitepaper dataset
        that are in \u201C2019\u201D journal issues but were first published online
        in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That\u2019s not a complaint fwiw, just an
        observation\u2026]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I first looked at an exemplar SN
        hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN\u2019s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Only
        those primary research articles where all the necessary metadata was available<br
        />were included in the analysis:<br />\u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the
        articles were identified as being published in a<br />journal with an impact
        factor<br />\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles had a corresponding
        author that had an<br />identifiable THE institutional ranking and country.</p><p><br
        />The overlap between these two factors left a final data set of 60,567 records<br
        />incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful readers
        will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the set of
        full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar year
        2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it is
        explicitly non-random \u2013 it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what\u2019s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn\u2019t even correspond
        with the data they\u2019ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI:
        10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9) published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid
        journal, it has a Clarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author
        affiliation on this paper is \u201CGraduate School of Education, University
        of the Ryukyus, Japan\u201D , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can\u2019t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> \u201CI\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose\u201D</em>. I can\u2019t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly \u201Csuppressed\u201D   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this \u201Csuppression\u201D
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        \u201Canomalous citation patterns\u201D but without much further detail given
        for each of the journals other than the overall \u201C% Self-cites\u201D of
        the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate\u2019s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher \u2018Magnolia Press\u2019
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the\_<a href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\"

        target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from
        both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (\u201Cself-citation\u201D at the journal-level
        from Clarivate\u2019s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important \u2018megajournal\u2019 for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate\u2019s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called \u2018<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>\u2018 indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        \u2018high\u2019 journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual\u2019s research output. In some regimes, if a
        researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it \u2018counts\u2019, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not \u2018count\u2019 towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate\u2019s wacky \u201Csuppression\u201D might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate\u2019s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please \u201Csuppress\u201D all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593770576,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that \u201CFact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 \u2013 $5000 US dollars\u2026\u201D
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier\u2019s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        </strong>26th February 2018</p>\\n<p><strong>Your complaint:</strong><br />\\nElsevier,
        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that \u201CFact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 \u2013 $5000 US dollars\u2026\u201D
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier\u2019s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier\u2019s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier\u2019s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        understand from your complaint that you felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising
        was misleading because it did not accurately reflect the price range of their
        products and they do not quote prices with VAT.\_ Please note that we have
        only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded to us, because we considered
        that the sign constituted point of sale material, which is not covered by
        our Codes.</p>\\n<p>We have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have
        breached the Advertising Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know
        that we have taken steps to address this.</p>\\n<p>We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising

        curious as to why Elsevier\_do not seem to be responding to emails at the

        GOAL mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier\u2019s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding
        readers across the world by charging them to access content that has been
        paid-for to be open access.</p>\\n<p>Below\_is the full content of <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004391.html\\\">my
        message</a>\_to the list, nicely formatted for clarity. I re-publish it here
        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want
        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been \u201Copen access\u201D to
        all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at all.
        Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">\u201Cabout
        $70,000\u201D to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>\u2014</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span>Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid \u201Copen access\u201D article paywalled and actively being sold at
        the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response Elsevier
        sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of everyone)
        that:</p>\\n<p><b>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this is the only
        article affected.\u201D</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for hybrid
        \u201Copen access\u201D article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://openapc.github.io/gener<wbr></wbr>al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr></wbr>_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I\u2019m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier\u2019s statement:</p>\\n<p>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.\u201D</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier\u2019s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier\u2019s system is not
        adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming this
        to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single web page,
        on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that Elsevier
        has been paid to make \u201ChybridOA\u201D</b> , including the DOIs of articles
        that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside at journals published
        by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently transferred to another
        publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested party to:</p>\\n<p>a)
        Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible from the publisher
        site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This \u2018master list\u2019 of Elsevier hybridOA
        can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists of paid invoices.
        Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but not on Elsevier\u2019s
        hybridOA \u2018master list\u2019 can be further investigated, to perhaps further
        reveal more articles that should be \u201Copen access\u201D that Elsevier\u2019s
        faulty \u201Csystem\u201D has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.) <b>Will Elsevier refund
        100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder, or individual that has a
        wrongly paywalled paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.)
        <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully pay for an independent 3rd party forensic
        accounting firm to go through their pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems
        and records</b>, including the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd
        February 2017), to produce a thorough openly available report on the extent
        of PPV payments AND re-use licensing payments for articles that should not
        have been sold to access, or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this
        to ensure that every individual who has paid to access or re-use \u2018mistakenly\u2019
        paywalled \u201Copen access\u201D material is refunded in full, with interest,

        $70,000\u201D to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>\u2014</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span>Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid \u201Copen access\u201D article paywalled and actively being sold at
        the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response Elsevier
        sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of everyone)
        that:</p>\\n<p><b>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this is the only
        article affected.\u201D</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for hybrid
        \u201Copen access\u201D article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier\u2019s statement:</p>\\n<p>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.\u201D</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier\u2019s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier\u2019s system is not
        adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming this
        to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single web page,
        on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that Elsevier
        has been paid to make \u201ChybridOA\u201D</b> , including the DOIs of articles
        that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside at journals published
        by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently transferred to another
        publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested party to:</p>\\n<p>a)
        Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible from the publisher
        site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This \u2018master list\u2019 of Elsevier hybridOA
        can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists of paid invoices.
        Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but not on Elsevier\u2019s
        hybridOA \u2018master list\u2019 can be further investigated, to perhaps further
        reveal more articles that should be \u201Copen access\u201D that Elsevier\u2019s
        faulty \u201Csystem\u201D has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.) <b>Will Elsevier refund
        100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder, or individual that has a
        wrongly paywalled paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.)
        <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully pay for an independent 3rd party forensic
        accounting firm to go through their pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems
        and records</b>, including the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd
        February 2017), to produce a thorough openly available report on the extent
        of PPV payments AND re-use licensing payments for articles that should not
        have been sold to access, or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this
        to ensure that every individual who has paid to access or re-use \u2018mistakenly\u2019
        paywalled \u201Copen access\u201D material is refunded in full, with interest,
        including the local taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with \u201Ccredit\u201D
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)

        have started to publish detailed reports on which articles they have paid-for

        a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be OA. In 2013 you
        may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally clean up
        OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that exercise,
        and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span>Our
        normal practice is to publish articles OA, but to move them back behind the
        firewall if after a grace period the invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked
        up as an article with an unpaid APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing
        malicious about what happened here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s
        APC, and your PPV charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else
        paid PPV for this article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span>\u2014

        283w\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Now let\u2019s return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent
        statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only
        article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span>I have just provided evidence
        (</span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span> article) that there are more
        paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles at Elsevier that are paywalled and
        have been sold to readers. As my receipt demonstrates, my purchase of this
        Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D article post-dates the above
        statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier\u2019s statement would appear to
        be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span>So we now have evidence of two further
        important things to note: </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><b>Elsevier\u2019s entire
        system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li><b>Elsevier
        are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span>Elsevier
        say they have gone through their \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no
        other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D by paywalls. But I have just
        provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span>To be clear
        I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier of knowingly lying about this. I am going to
        charitably interpret this as an unknowingly false statement \u2013 they believe
        it to be true from what their faulty \u201Csystem\u201D tells them, but in
        reality it is not true, other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident
        to me that Elsevier\u2019s internal systems and processes for tracking invoices
        for APC payments, handling, and marking hybrid open access articles simply
        aren\u2019t robust. I believe that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence
        that </span><b>Elsevier is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access
        publishing</b><span> and that this incompetence financially benefits them
        through pay-per-view payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a
        href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span>the
        scholarly poor</span></a><span> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege
        malicious intent. The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency
        </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> demonstrably generating profits for them
        \u2013 that is undeniable and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial
        loss to readers who have paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What
        is the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span>I
        have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite answer as to the extent, millions
        of articles are published every year, I can\u2019t check them all myself.
        But one thing I do know and can now evidence, is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier
        don\u2019t know either</b><span><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent
        audit with forensic accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier,
        back in 2014 Elsevier self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000
        to access articles that should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014
        the rate of publication of hybrid open access articles has increased so I
        would expect if a competent independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019
        paywalled articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well
        be in excess of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its
        paid-for hybrid open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported
        audit of such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent
        audit is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span>.
        I have only partially cross-checked the accessibility of hybrid open access
        articles from just </span><i><span>one</span></i><span> research funder at
        Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span>there
        are at least 14,155 different research funders</span></a><span>. The charge
        to make articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000
        but can be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span>
        article which was \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error,
        Elsevier typically refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen
        access\u201D article per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would
        equate to a refund of approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still
        chump change to Elsevier: a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span>annual
        adjusted operating profit of \xA3826 million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126
        billion</span></a><span>. </span></p>\\n<p><span>Nor in terms of scale is
        this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen access\u201D
        articles for sale at Emerald Publishing Group (<a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/07/checking-wellcome-oa/\\\">exonerated
        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span>I stress however
        that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong> open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only
        fully open access publishers are reliable</strong></h3>\\n<p><span>How many
        times have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.plos.org/\\\"><span>PLOS</span></a><span>
        accidentally paywalled an article? [0]</span></p>\\n<p><span>How many times

        accidentally paywalled an article? [0]</span></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers
        such as PeerJ, PLOS, MDPI, Hindawi, Copernicus, Pensoft, F1000Research, and
        Ubiquity Press to name but a few, have an open access compliance \u201Cerror\u201D
        rate of absolutely ZERO, out of hundreds of thousands of articles published
        so far.</p>\\n<p><span>In some respects these are facile statements to make
        about full open access publishers. But that </span><i><span>is</span></i><span>
        my point. It is </span><i><span>known</span></i><span> that PLOS and PeerJ
        cannot paywall and \u2018mistakenly sell\u2019 articles to readers because
        their systems are open by default and do not have paywalls. At fully open
        access publishers, all articles are open and thus when an APC is paid or a
        fee waiver awarded, </span><b>there is </b><b><i>never</i></b><b> any failure
        to make articles available in a manner that is both freely accessible to readers</b><span>
        (not paywalled) </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> licensed under an open
        access definition compatible Creative Commons licence that </span><a href=\\\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/open-access-policy\\\"><span>Wellcome
        Trust requires</span></a><span>.</span></p>\\n<p>If research funders and institutions
        really want open access publication, under open access definition compliant
        licensing, they should use full open access publishers.</p>\\n<p><span>Luckily
        </span><a href=\\\"https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1002\\\"><span>not
        all research funders allow their money to be used to pay for hybrid open access
        charges</span></a><span>. This is sensible policy in my opinion, given the
        evidently incompetent open access service provided by many, not just Elsevier.</span></p>\\n<h3><b>Conclusions:
        what can funders &amp; APC-paying institutions do about this going forwards?</b></h3>\\n<p><span>As
        soon as reasonably possible, <strong>stop paying for hybrid open access</strong>.
        It is not reliable. If funders and institutions really want open access, use
        preprint servers and full open access journals. Hybrid open access is demonstrably
        unreliable, vastly over-priced, and does not help towards long term goals
        of open access as it helps keep subscription-access journals going and takes
        good articles away from full open access journals. It is time to end the experiment.</span></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pberv-kyt47\",\"id\":\"0fc8925d-ca50-4ba5-b822-e753bd4d317d\",\"image\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-18-084918_907x678_scrot.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1487613865,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"<strong><em>The

        \u2013 we are looking into this, but an initial glance at the article suggests

        that Elsevier\u2019s initial response suggests that I might have been incorrect

        in fact already paid Elsevier \xA32,168.08 many years ago to make this article
        open access, it should have been open access at their website, and should
        NOT be on sale to anyone.</span></p>\\n<p><i><span>Hi Ross, this has taken
        a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be OA. In 2013 you
        may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally clean up
        OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that exercise,
        and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span>Our
        normal practice is to publish articles OA, but to move them back behind the
        firewall if after a grace period the invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked
        up as an article with an unpaid APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing
        malicious about what happened here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s
        APC, and your PPV charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else
        paid PPV for this article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span>\u2014

        the above statement from Elsevier there is something much\_more astonishing.
        Elsevier clearly wants us all to \u201C<a href=\\\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoveAlongNothingToSeeHere\\\">move
        along, nothing to see here</a>\u201D by stating that the <em>Mitochondrion</em>

        be.</p>\\n<h3><strong>But there <em>are</em> more paywalled open access articles
        at Elsevier journals</strong></h3>\\n<p><span>Until now I haven\u2019t disclosed
        publicly that there is at least one other paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D

        </span><i><span>despite</span></i><span> having been handsomely paid-for to

        \xA35,280.00 to make the article in the screenshot below, open access in perpetuity.
        In 2017 I find it is on sale at ScienceDirect for $35.95 + VAT. I bought access

        283w\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Now let\u2019s return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent
        statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only
        article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span>I have just provided evidence
        (</span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span> article) that there are more
        paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles at Elsevier that are paywalled and
        have been sold to readers. As my receipt demonstrates, my purchase of this
        Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D article post-dates the above
        statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier\u2019s statement would appear to
        be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span>So we now have evidence of two further
        important things to note: </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><b>Elsevier\u2019s entire
        system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li><b>Elsevier
        are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span>Elsevier
        say they have gone through their \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no
        other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D by paywalls. But I have just
        provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span>To be clear
        I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier of knowingly lying about this. I am going to
        charitably interpret this as an unknowingly false statement \u2013 they believe
        it to be true from what their faulty \u201Csystem\u201D tells them, but in
        reality it is not true, other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident
        to me that Elsevier\u2019s internal systems and processes for tracking invoices
        for APC payments, handling, and marking hybrid open access articles simply
        aren\u2019t robust. I believe that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence
        that </span><b>Elsevier is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access
        publishing</b><span> and that this incompetence financially benefits them
        through pay-per-view payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a
        href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span>the
        scholarly poor</span></a><span> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege
        malicious intent. The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency
        </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> demonstrably generating profits for them
        \u2013 that is undeniable and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial
        loss to readers who have paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What
        is the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span>I
        have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite answer as to the extent, millions
        of articles are published every year, I can\u2019t check them all myself.
        But one thing I do know and can now evidence, is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier
        don\u2019t know either</b><span><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent
        audit with forensic accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier,
        back in 2014 Elsevier self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000
        to access articles that should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014
        the rate of publication of hybrid open access articles has increased so I
        would expect if a competent independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019
        paywalled articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well
        be in excess of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its
        paid-for hybrid open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported
        audit of such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent
        audit is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span>.
        I have only partially cross-checked the accessibility of hybrid open access
        articles from just </span><i><span>one</span></i><span> research funder at
        Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span>there
        are at least 14,155 different research funders</span></a><span>. The charge
        to make articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000
        but can be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span>
        article which was \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error,
        Elsevier typically refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen
        access\u201D article per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would
        equate to a refund of approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still
        chump change to Elsevier: a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span>annual
        adjusted operating profit of \xA3826 million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126
        billion</span></a><span>. </span></p>\\n<p><span>Nor in terms of scale is
        this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen access\u201D
        articles for sale at Emerald Publishing Group (<a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/07/checking-wellcome-oa/\\\">exonerated
        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span>I stress however
        that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong> open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only
        fully open access publishers are reliable</strong></h3>\\n<p><span>How many
        times have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.plos.org/\\\"><span>PLOS</span></a><span>
        accidentally paywalled an article? [0]</span></p>\\n<p><span>How many times
        have </span><a href=\\\"https://peerj.com/\\\"><span>PeerJ</span></a><span>
        accidentally paywalled an article? [0]</span></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers
        such as PeerJ, PLOS, MDPI, Hindawi, Copernicus, Pensoft, F1000Research, and
        Ubiquity Press to name but a few, have an open access compliance \u201Cerror\u201D
        rate of absolutely ZERO, out of hundreds of thousands of articles published
        so far.</p>\\n<p><span>In some respects these are facile statements to make
        about full open access publishers. But that </span><i><span>is</span></i><span>
        my point. It is </span><i><span>known</span></i><span> that PLOS and PeerJ
        cannot paywall and \u2018mistakenly sell\u2019 articles to readers because
        their systems are open by default and do not have paywalls. At fully open
        access publishers, all articles are open and thus when an APC is paid or a
        fee waiver awarded, </span><b>there is </b><b><i>never</i></b><b> any failure
        to make articles available in a manner that is both freely accessible to readers</b><span>
        (not paywalled) </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> licensed under an open
        access definition compatible Creative Commons licence that </span><a href=\\\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/open-access-policy\\\"><span>Wellcome
        Trust requires</span></a><span>.</span></p>\\n<p>If research funders and institutions
        really want open access publication, under open access definition compliant
        licensing, they should use full open access publishers.</p>\\n<p><span>Luckily
        </span><a href=\\\"https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1002\\\"><span>not
        all research funders allow their money to be used to pay for hybrid open access
        charges</span></a><span>. This is sensible policy in my opinion, given the
        evidently incompetent open access service provided by many, not just Elsevier.</span></p>\\n<h3><b>Conclusions:
        what can funders &amp; APC-paying institutions do about this going forwards?</b></h3>\\n<p><span>As
        soon as reasonably possible, <strong>stop paying for hybrid open access</strong>.
        It is not reliable. If funders and institutions really want open access, use
        preprint servers and full open access journals. Hybrid open access is demonstrably
        unreliable, vastly over-priced, and does not help towards long term goals
        of open access as it helps keep subscription-access journals going and takes
        good articles away from full open access journals. It is time to end the experiment.</span></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pberv-kyt47\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"<strong><em>The
