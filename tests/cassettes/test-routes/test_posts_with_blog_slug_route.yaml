        respect to Jeffrey, I don't think it quite fully covered\\nwhat's going on
        here. I think it's Clarivate that has problems, not\\neLife.\\n\\nFrom my
        perspective, the tension between innovation in research\\npublishing and Clarivate's
        wish to demonstrate some kind of arbitrary\\n'selectivity' has been bubbling
        along for over a decade now. Researchers\\n& research funders are getting
        to grips with the affordances of\\ndigitality, trying new processes and discovering
        that some processes &\\nworkflows result in better outcomes in terms of rigour,
        financial cost,\\ntransparency, and/or a reduction in research waste. I'm
        thinking\\nparticularly about transparency of process and timing of process.\\nDigitality
        allows for the traditional pre-digital publishing process to\\nbe\\n[decoupled](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full)\\nand

        in some\\ndisciplines to find research being published before peer-review,
        and\\n*then* sent for some kind of peer-review *after* being published online.\\nThis
        is sometimes referred to as the \\\"Publish-\\\\>Review-\\\\>Curate\\\" model.\\n[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/understanding-the-publish-review-curate-prc-model-of-scholarly-communication)\\nhave
        a nice explainer of the PRC model.\\n\\nI infer that Clarivate / Web of Science
        doesn't seem to like the PRC\\nmodel. I don't base this on wild supposition,
        it is based on what I can\\nobserve from the growing fleet of journals that
        are now operating a\\nPRC-only model and are excluded from Clarivate indexing:\\n\\n-

        it would be this (below). Clarivate no longer indexes the best\\nresearch

        CLOCKSS Board will release archived content if the archived content\\nis determined

        at least six consecutive months.\\\"\\n\\nA calendar month may contain**\_28
        to 31 calendar days**, the average is\\n30.437. If we are generous and assume
        30.437 days, then the \\\"six months\\\"\\nreferred to in CLOCKSS agreement
        translates into 182.622 calendar days.\\n193 days is greater than 182 days
        and so I am puzzled as to why CLOCKSS\\nhave chosen not to publicly release
        *Heterocycles* yet. Who are CLOCKSS\\nserving and who's interests do they
        represent?\\n\\nMy first question to CLOCKSS and the CLOCKSS board is therefore
        -- why\\nwas the journal not released after e.g. 183 days of being continuously\\nunavailable?\\n\\nI
        contacted a current board member of CLOCKSS after 181 days of\\nunavailability
        (2024-05-30) and was told that the CLOCKSS board had not\\nyet been briefed
        about *Heterocycles* at this point in time! Remarkable!\\nWhere is the sense
        of urgency at CLOCKSS? My assertion here is that\\nevery single day that the
        journal content remains offline creates harm\\nto the citation potential of
        the articles contained within the journal.\\nCausing harm to individuals (authors),
        research performing\\norganisations, and research funding organisations (at
        the least). The\\ncontent must be made available as soon as rules allow! Any
        delay in\\nexcess of 182 days is a political choice made by CLOCKSS to go
        beyond\\nthe minimum period stated in the contract (and six months is way
        way too\\nlong in my opinion). CLOCKSS needs to be held accountable for this\\nchoice
        to delay the release of the 17,000+ *Heterocycles* journal\\narticles, some
        of which were only published recently, right up into\\n2023!\\n\\nI am rather
        worried about the current governance setup of CLOCKSS -- the\\n[CLOCKSS\\nboard](https://clockss.org/digital-archive-community/board-of-directors/)\\nis
        rather narrowly composed of just publishers and librarians. Who is\\nthere
        to represent the interests of authors who have published in these\\njournals?
        Who is there to represent the interests of patients who have\\nbeen experimented
        on, and the results of those experiments published in\\njournals archived
        in CLOCKSS? \\\\[There are medical journals archived in\\nCLOCKSS\\\\]. Who
        is there to represent the interests of charities &\\ntaxpayers who by some
        estimates fund approximately 80% of academic\\nresearch?\\n\\nRather than
        just point the finger, I have offered to join the CLOCKSS\\nboard to see if
        I can add some ideas from within.\\n\\nCLOCKSS make a lot of use of the word
        \\\"community\\\" on their website, but\\nI infer they define their community
        as exclusively just publishers and\\nlibrarians. I note that Chris Hartgerink
        has written a great post\\nrecently about how the term [\\\"community\\\"
        has been\\nco-opted](https://www.chjh.nl/community-is-the-new-family/). I\\nfundamentally
        disagree that publishers and librarians are the *only*\\nstakeholders in published
        scholarship. I see scholarship as a global\\npublic good. This is also [the
        position of the International Science\\nCouncil](https://council.science/current/news/science-as-a-global-public-good/)\\nand
        others. I really think there needs to be a wider selection of people\\ninvolved
        in the governance & decision-making at CLOCKSS.\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n\\nClause
        4E of the CLOCKSS standard participating agreement is also a bit\\nvague:
        \\\"Released Content use terms and restrictions will be determined\\nby an
        accompanying Creative Commons license (or equivalent license)\\nchosen either
        by Publisher or, if Publisher fails to respond within\\nthirty (30) days following
        receipt by it of the notice described above,\\nby the CLOCKSS Board.\\\"  \\n
        \ \\nWhen CLOCKSS finally gets around to releasing *Heterocycles* from\\ndarkness,
        which exact Creative Commons licence will the CLOCKSS Board\\nchoose? OASPA
        and many other organisations [recommend CC\\nBY](https://www.oaspa.org/news/why-cc-by/).
        If the CLOCKSS Board chooses\\nCC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-ND, or CC BY-NC-ND
        it would hamper re-use\\nof the journal content in important Wikimedia projects
        such as\\n[Wikimedia\\nCommons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing).\\n\\n**CLOCKSS
        provides access, not just preservation**\\n\\nIf and when CLOCKSS does release
        *Heterocycles*, it will more than\\ndouble the current number of articles
        that CLOCKSS provides access to,\\nwhich is merely \\\\~13,000 articles at
        the moment. CLOCKSS will\\nincreasingly become a publication platform that
        provides access to\\nresearch that people want & need to read. CLOCKSS is
        not just a digital\\npreservation service -- it is an access provider too.
        I wonder if\\nCLOCKSS has forgotten about the access part? I look forward
        to the day\\nwhen CLOCKSS finally decides to publicly release *Heterocycles*
        to the\\nworld, but as of this moment, I regret to say I am still waiting
        and it\\nis unclear why there is such a delay beyond the 182 day minimum...\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/3wsn2-2kp03\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2553\",\"id\":\"cc09cb8b-f3cf-4580-9124-9a935268799a\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/clockss-logo.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1718103243,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"rid\":\"5jx96-2em96\",\"status\":\"active\",\"summary\":\"The

        the time of writing this (2024-04-11), the entire content of a \\\"key\\\"\\nchemistry
        journal called *Heterocycles*, with over 17,000 articles in\\nit, from 1973
        to 2023, has been knocked offline due to what the\\npublisher vaguely describes
        as \\\"various circumstances\\\".\\n\\nThe journal has been unavailable to
        access online since December 2023,\\nwhich means the content has been offline
        for four or five months now!\\nDalmeet Singh Chawla (2024) has written an
        excellent piece about this\\ndebacle for the magazine *Chemistry World*. I'd
        recommend you [read\\nit](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/a-key-chemistry-journal-disappeared-from-the-web-others-are-at-risk/4019265.article)\\nbefore
        coming back to read my post here.\\n\\nThe good news is the content isn't
        completely lost. A not-for-profit\\norganisation supposedly dedicated to digital
        preservation of scholarly\\ncontent, called CLOCKSS ought to have a copy of
        every single digital\\narticle that has been published in *Heterocycles*.
        However, recent\\nresearch by Martin P. Eve (2024) demonstrates that whilst
        dark archives\\nlike CLOCKSS preserve journal content at a title-level, when
        this is\\nchecked at an *article-level* it can be observed that actual digital\\npreservation
        of journals at the article-level by a dark archive can be\\npatchy.\\n\\nThanks
        to the accompanying website for Eve's (2024) article, we can\\nexamine the
        [exact article-level preservation\\nstatus](https://the-vault.fly.dev/Member_Data?members=2364+%28The+Japan+Institute+of+Heterocyclic+Chemistry%29)\\nof
        a sample of a thousand articles from *Heterocycles*. All of Eve's\\nsample
        for *Heterocycles* are either \\\"preserved\\\" in CLOCKSS or\\n\\\"preserved
        (in progress)\\\" at CLOCKSS. Eve's work also reveals that\\nincomplete /
        patchy selections of *Heterocycles* articles are preserved\\nat HathiTrust,
        Internet Archive, and OCUL Scholars Portal.\\n\\nSo, I hope CLOCKSS does have
        a complete digital copy of the journal, but\\nthe question is: will CLOCKSS
        make it available? This all depends on\\nCLOCKSS assessment of whether a \\\"trigger
        event\\\" has occurred here. From\\nthe information given on the CLOCKSS website
        it seems that the\\ndefinition of a trigger event is quite open to interpretation.
        If a\\ntitle is no longer offered (online), the publisher is no longer\\nproviding
        access to the content AND there are no successor interests or\\nreversion
        or transfer of rights then (and only then) CLOCKSS will make\\ntheir copies
        available online for all to read. From what the executive\\ndirector of CLOCKSS
        says in the *Chemistry World* interview, it seems\\nCLOCKSS are choosing to
        wait for the publisher of *Heterocycles* to find\\na successor. Alicia Wise
        is quoted as saying: \\\"we will be in a position\\nto make it available should
        they not find a successor organisation to\\nlook after it\\\".\\n\\n**Ethical
        Dilemma**\\n\\nHerein lies the ethical dilemma... how long should CLOCKSS
        wait for the\\npublisher of *Heterocycles* to find a business successor? Over
        17,000\\njournal articles have been offline for over 4 months now. CLOCKSS
        cannot\\nand should not wait forever -- it is not ethical to wait for too
        long --\\nit would be unfair on all the authors of the content, the research\\nfunders
        of the content, and the readers who need to read what is\\npublished in it.\\n\\nI
        am troubled by the lack of transparency in CLOCKSS decision making\\nhere
        -- who decides how long CLOCKSS should wait for business\\nsuccessors, before
        declaring a trigger event? I am concerned about\\npossible conflicts of interest
        that might creep in here too, for\\ninstance *Heterocycles* has a longstanding
        relationship with Elsevier.\\nElsevier were the official distributor of *Heterocycles*
        in all\\ncountries of the world, except for Japan\\n([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042352/http://www.journals.elsevier.com/heterocycles)).\\nIn
        my view Elsevier could conceivably be a prime candidate as a\\n'business successor'
        to take over *Heterocycles* and extract rent from\\nit, for profit. The current
        executive director of CLOCKSS is Alicia Wise\\nwho is well known for her time
        in employment at Elsevier as its\\n\\\"[Director of Universal\\nAccess](https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24115)\\\".
        Any extra\\ndelay in declaring this a \\\"trigger event\\\" at CLOCKSS could
        be construed\\nas buying time for a business deal to arrange a successor.
        \ \\n  \\nMy personal feeling here is that 4 months is plenty of time. CLOCKSS\\ncurrent
        policy seems to prioritise the needs of businesses and business\\ninterests.
        The needs of authors, readers, research funders and research\\ninstitutions
        are ignored.\\n\\nPut yourself in the shoes of an author of a recent article,
        published at\\n*Heterocycles*: you've spent 2 years doing some research, got
        it through\\npeer review, it's published in *Heterocycles* in 2023 and now
        the\\njournal is completely offline and no-one (even loyal, paying-subscriber\\ninstitutions)
        can access / read / cite the digital version of your\\narticle \U0001F643\\n\\nAnd
        CLOCKSS just sits there and just says 'well we *could* provide\\ndigital access
        to the articles', but we won't because of business\\ninterests... I would
        be hopping mad!\\n\\nFor instance: \\\"Synthesis of Arylideneisoxazol-5-ones
        Catalyzed by Sodium\\nCyclamate\\\" authored by Ziba Daroughezadeh and Hamzeh
        Kiyani and\\npublished in *Heterocycles* in 2023, \_pp.\_1187-1197, with the
        DOI:\\n[10.3987/com-23-14859](https://doi.org/10.3987/com-23-14859) . Won't\\nthis
        clearly cause harm to the citation potential of this work if people\\ncan't
        access the digital copy? If you can't read it, you can't cite it.\\n\\nI know
        that some libraries hold print runs of *Heterocycles*,\\n[WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/title/866106914)
        data (if\\nreliable) says that UCL and Leiden have print copies but most\\nuniversities
        around the world definitely do not have print copies of\\nthis journal.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nOver
        17,000 research articles have been knocked offline for over 4\\nmonths and
        CLOCKSS is for the moment choosing not to classify this as a\\n\\\"trigger
        event\\\".\\n\\nI think research funders, researchers, and research institutions
        need to\\nlook very closely at this and reconsider how they publish research
        --\\nthe old way seems to prioritize business interests over the needs of
        the\\nresearch community. As I have argued before (Mounce, 2023),\\nopenly-licensed
        journal publication provides the resilience we need when\\njournal publishing
        businesses fail, for whatever reason. \\\"All rights\\nreserved\\\" content,

        that Scopus has been instrumental in legitimizing publication\\nscams whereby

        on a website that looks like a real scholarly\\njournal but is in fact not
        a proper journal, merely an impersonation of\\none. Scopus was thoroughly
        caught-out with some excellent,\\nwell-documented work by Anna Albakina \\\\[2\\\\].
        Kudos to Anna!\\n\\nAs the *Science* article explains, the scammers: \\\"....managed
        to get\\nScopus to list a URL other than the real journal's...\\\" , I have
        heard\\nnothing so far from Elsevier or Scopus about their investigation as
        to\\nhow this happened. Isn't it a very important and basic part of their
        job\\nto get the identity of the material they are indexing correct?  \\n
        \ \\nOne amusing response I do note from Scopus is that rather than\\ninvestigating
        the issue and implementing new processes to do a better\\njob of it -- they've
        actually just decided to completely abandon doing\\nthat particular job! On
        the 18th December 2023, Scopus posted a message\\non their official blog (yes,
        I checked the URL, it's not a \\\"hijacked\\\"\\nblog, this *is* the official
        Scopus blog -- see Scopus, it's not hard to\\ncheck the URL provenance!) to
        say: \\\"[Scopus will remove the Source\\nHomepage links from all Source details\\npages](https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages)\\\".\\n\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\nThe

        one hand, they want to reassure readers that \\\"Maintaining the\\nintegrity

        to us...\\\" and \\\"Ensuring research integrity is a top\\npriority for us...\\\"
        but the actual thing this post is announcing is that\\nthey have been caught-out
        and now they no longer wish to bear the\\nresponsibility of pointing accurately
        to where a peer-reviewed journal\\nexists on the web (the 'Source Homepage'
        in Scopus-speak).\\nDisapprovingly, I also note that Albakina's excellent
        work that almost\\ncertainly prompted this, is not mentioned or cited anywhere

        the French National Centre for Scientific Research (in French:\\n*Centre national
        de la recherche scientifique*, CNRS) have recently\\ndiscontinued their subscriptions
        to Scopus \\\\[4\\\\]. If Scopus isn't\\nwilling to risk doing the useful
        and difficult work of checking\\nprovenance and integrity -- why should research
        institutions keep paying\\nthem?  \\n  \\nPleasingly, I note that other organizations
        including the [Directory of\\nOpen Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ),
        are well-placed to fill\\nthe abdication from responsibility by Scopus here.
        DOAJ links to the\\nofficial website URL for each and every journal listed
        in DOAJ. This a\\nvaluable service. This comes with a certain risk but I do
        hope DOAJ\\ncarry-on with this practice, as it *is* good value-add for the
        global\\ncommunity. Someone needs to take responsibility for where journals
        are,\\nonline!\\n\\nDoes anyone care to predict what value-add service Scopus
        will\\narbitrarily stop offering, without consulting customers, in 2024? Will\\nScopus
        spiral into a managed decline like Twitter? Who knows? But I'll\\nbe watching,
        that's for sure...\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\\\[1\\\\] Brainard, J. (2023) Leading

        the major 'Atyponocalypse' downtime\\nevent of 17th December 2020. Do you
        remember it? I certainly do (the\\nscreenshot above is from that event). The
        journal hosting platforms of\\nSAGE, ACS Publications, Wiley, Taylor & Francis
        and many others all\\nsimultaneously went offline for roughly a 24 hour period
        because of an\\nerror at [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon), the
        publishing\\nplatform that many different legacy publishers use. It was\\nunprecedented.
        People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of\\nimportant knowledge
        were made almost completely digitally unavailable,\\nworldwide. I like how\\n[Brie](https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185)
        put\\nit, at the time:  \\n  \\n\\\"One day left for student finals and Wiley's
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites\\nare all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and\\nconsolidations of academic knowledge again?\\\"  \\n  \\n\\\"1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with\\n[\\\\#WileyDown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click)\\\"\\n(and
        that was the numbers for just *one* publisher)\\n\\nThe interesting thing
        about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for\\nmuch of the content affected,
        there was no alternative, legal platform\\nhosting the content in parallel.
        Nor could people put online temporary\\ncopies to help students and researchers
        access the content they urgently\\nneeded -- because of the copyright restrictions
        on that content. Many of\\nthe legacy publishers, for their paywalled journals
        (only), still have\\nthis major single-point-of-failure weakness.\\n\\nBut
        open access content does NOT suffer these weaknesses.  \\n  \\nAs I allude
        to in the title of this post. The key differentiators here\\nin open access
        systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime\\noverall are a)
        availability on multiple independent platforms and b)\\nopen licencing that
        makes it legally easier to host content in multiple\\nplaces.\\n\\nTools such
        as Google Scholar, [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), and\\n[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)

        I\\ncalculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For\\ncontext
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered\\nindicative of
        a strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a\\nskew of 8.1,
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set\\nhas
        a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.\\nThis
        level of skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992)\\ntermed the

        on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance\\nof an article
        that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the\\njournal (their \\\"Gold
        OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article\\nwhich has a parallel
        copy publicly available only 365 days after the\\npublication date, gives
        the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the\\npurported open access benefit
        to take effect. Effectively it's an unfair\\ncomparison where the \\\"Gold
        OA\\\" set has been given an additional year or\\nsix months extra to accrue
        citations relative to the eventual public\\nemergence of green OA author manuscripts.
        But with the advent of the\\n[Rights Retention\\nStrategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"}\\nwhereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we\\nmay eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation\\nbenefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a\\nrepository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be\\nco-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded\\nresearch, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more\\nhighly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded\\nresearch from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid\\njournals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would\\nreally be demonstrating is funder choice
        for research that tends to be\\nmore highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive\\nway possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital\\nLibrary
        appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some\\narticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"},
        the rest\\nof the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems
        no cap\\non the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options
        over\\ntime. At current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most\\nresearch
        institutions simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open\\naccess at
        Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if it did somehow\\ngarner a
        tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is it worth\\n\\\\$2780 per
        article? I think not.\\n\\n5.) Fully open access journals of which [there
        are over 17,000 listed at\\nDOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"}\\nare typically both lower in price and
        often higher in citation\\nperformance per article as I demonstrated with

        Winter.\\n\\nSpringer Nature present cherry-picked analyses with an experimental\\ndesign
        of their choosing, of 60,567 articles published in 1,262 of their\\n'hybrid'
        journals.\\n\\n**What is a 'hybrid' journal?**\\n\\nA 'hybrid' journal is
        a journal that is predominantly a paywalled\\nsubscription journal, albeit
        that it permits individual articles within\\nthat journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:\\n\\n- \\\\(1\\\\) the author(s), institution,
        or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure\\n  permanent openness of an individual
        article with a Creative Commons\\n  license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(2\\\\) the
        journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access\\n  to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,\\n\\nor\\n\\n- \\\\(3\\\\) the journal
        just turns off the paywall on an individual article\\n  at whim without author-side
        payment, without a Creative Commons\\n  license, and importantly without any
        assurance of permanence of the\\n  turned-off paywall state (so called '[bronze\\n
        \ OA](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)').\\n\\nSpringer Nature use the results
        of various analyses to claim, presumably\\nto an audience of governments,
        policymakers, and researchers that they\\nshould focus their efforts (funding
        \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA\\njournals rather than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts
        which seek to increase the availability of Green OA don't\\ncreate the intended
        benefits and risk delaying or even preventing the\\ntake up of full Gold OA
        and achieving the benefits described above.\\nWhile sharing of subscription-tied
        earlier versions can help the\\ndissemination of research, they do not have
        as strong a reach or impact\\nas full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the
        continuation of\\nsubscription models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing\\nprocesses
        to validate and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe\\ninvestment in
        Gold OA should be a priority and is the only way to\\nachieve full, immediate
        and sustainable OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do
        their analysis, do not\\naccurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which
        intervention has\\nmore impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial
        pricing\\ndifferential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design
        in the\\n(not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In\\nthe SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research\\npapers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,\\nLetters,
        News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews,\\nObituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\",\\n\\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the\\njournal in
        the calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31\\ninclusive).
        An interesting quirk of this is that lots of research\\narticles within the
        first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals are excluded\\nbecause they tend to
        be published online in 2017 and only assigned to a\\n\\\"2018\\\" issue later-on.
        Similarly there are many articles in the SN\\nwhitepaper dataset that are
        in \\\"2019\\\" journal issues but were first\\npublished online in 2018 e.g.
        say December 2018. \\\\[That's not a\\ncomplaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen
        I first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes\\nSociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*,
        I was shocked to\\nobserve a large discrepancy between the number of full
        research articles\\nin that journal, that were published in the calendar year
        2018 (53), and\\nthe much fewer number of articles from that journal included
        in SN's\\nwhitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily\\nexcludes
        24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in 2018, in\\nthis journal.\\n\\nThe
        SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent about the selectivity of their\\nsampling.
        On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata\\n> was available  \\n> were included in the analysis:
        \ \\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being\\n>
        published in a  \\n> journal with an impact factor  \\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333
        (44%) of the articles had a corresponding author that\\n> had an  \\n> identifiable
        THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>   \\n> The overlap between
        these two factors left a final data set of 60,567\\n> records  \\n> incorporated
        in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333
        amounts to just\\n38.5% of the set of full research articles in SN hybrid
        journals,\\npublished in the calendar year 2018. It might be okay were this
        sample a\\nrandom sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random -- it excludes\\nfull
        research articles with corresponding authors from outside the set\\nof 2,112
        institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)\\nrankings. For
        context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at\\nleast [31,000 higher
        education institutions in the\\nworld](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a\\nsignificant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly\\nglobal or balanced picture of what's being published in SN
        hybrid\\njournals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology
        doesn't even\\ncorrespond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within\\n*Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this\\npaper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"}
        (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)\\npublished in April 2018. The journal is
        a hybrid journal, it has a\\nClarivate Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding
        author\\naffiliation on this paper is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University\\nof
        the Ryukyus, Japan\\\" , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the\\nlucky
        2,112 institutions to be included in the THE\\nrankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"\\ndata-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},\\ntherefore
        I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset\\nof 60,567
        articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample\\nfrom 157,333
        articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear\\nto match their
        stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the report
        for the full list of\\n157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the\\nresponse from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able

        examining the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold\\nOA and

        from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more\\nmeasurable impact
        (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However,\\n[Over 130 peer-reviewed
        studies have previously tested for the existence\\nof the 'open access citation

        one could calculate the cost of hybrid gold on the\\n  basis of estimated
        per article costs contained within 'transformative\\n  agreement' big deals
        as listed at the [ESAC\\n  registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).\\n
