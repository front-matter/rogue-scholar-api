        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude

        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org

        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge

        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading

        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive

        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold

        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this

        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe

        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report

        this has taken a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be
        OA. In 2013 you may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally
        clean up OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that
        exercise, and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our normal practice is to publish articles
        OA, but to move them back behind the firewall if after a grace period the
        invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked up as an article with an unpaid
        APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing malicious about what happened
        here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s APC, and your PPV
        charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else paid PPV for this
        article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m
        shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have just provided evidence (</span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> article) that there are more paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles
        at Elsevier that are paywalled and have been sold to readers. As my receipt
        demonstrates, my purchase of this Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D
        article post-dates the above statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier&#8217;s
        statement would appear to be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">So we now have evidence of two further important things to note:
        </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><b>Elsevier\u2019s
        entire system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><b>Elsevier are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Elsevier say they have gone through their
        \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D
        by paywalls. But I have just provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To be clear I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier
        of knowingly lying about this. I am going to charitably interpret this as
        an unknowingly false statement &#8211; they believe it to be true from what
        their faulty &#8220;system&#8221; tells them, but in reality it is not true,
        other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident to me that Elsevier\u2019s
        internal systems and processes for tracking invoices for APC payments, handling,
        and marking hybrid open access articles simply aren\u2019t robust. I believe
        that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence that </span><b>Elsevier
        is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access publishing</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> and that this incompetence financially benefits them through pay-per-view
        payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the scholarly poor</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege malicious intent.
        The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency </span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> demonstrably generating profits for them &#8211; that is undeniable
        and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial loss to readers who have
        paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What is
        the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite
        answer as to the extent, millions of articles are published every year, I
        can&#8217;t check them all myself. But one thing I do know and can now evidence,
        is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier don\u2019t know either</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent audit with forensic
        accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier, back in 2014 Elsevier
        self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000 to access articles that
        should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014 the rate of publication
        of hybrid open access articles has increased so I would expect if a competent
        independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019 paywalled
        articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well be in excess
        of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its paid-for hybrid
        open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported audit of
        such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent audit
        is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. I have only partially cross-checked the
        accessibility of hybrid open access articles from just </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">one</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> research funder
        at Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">there are at least 14,155 different research
        funders</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. The charge to make
        articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000 but can
        be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The
        Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> article which was
        \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error, Elsevier typically
        refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen access\u201D article
        per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would equate to a refund of
        approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still chump change to Elsevier:
        a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">annual adjusted operating profit of \xA3826
        million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126 billion</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Nor in terms
        of scale is this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen
        access\u201D articles for sale at <strike>Emerald Publishing Group</strike>
        (<a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/07/checking-wellcome-oa/\\\">exonerated
        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I stress however that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong>
        open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only fully open access publishers

        rate of absolutely ZERO, out of hundreds of thousands of articles published
        so far.</p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In some respects these

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> that PLOS and PeerJ cannot paywall and \u2018mistakenly
        sell\u2019 articles to readers because their systems are open by default and
        do not have paywalls. At fully open access publishers, all articles are open
        and thus when an APC is paid or a fee waiver awarded, </span><b>there is </b><b><i>never</i></b><b>

        journals. Hybrid open access is demonstrably unreliable, vastly over-priced,
        and does not help towards long term goals of open access as it helps keep
        subscription-access journals going and takes good articles away from full
        open access journals.

        academic, fed-up with abysmally poor publishing services, I have decided to
        systematically run heuristic checks on articles that Wellcome Trust has paid-for
        to be open access. The Wellcome Trust and other research funders have started
        to publish detailed reports on which articles they have paid-for to be open
        access, with which publishers, and how much they paid publishers to make each
        article open access in perpetuity. I have used </span><a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/authors/Robert_Kiley/3230210\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">these public records</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        to anyone.</span></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Hi Ross,
        this has taken a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be
        OA. In 2013 you may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally
        clean up OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that
        exercise, and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our normal practice is to publish articles
        OA, but to move them back behind the firewall if after a grace period the
        invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked up as an article with an unpaid
        APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing malicious about what happened
        here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s APC, and your PPV
        charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else paid PPV for this
        article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m
        shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have just provided evidence (</span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> article) that there are more paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles
        at Elsevier that are paywalled and have been sold to readers. As my receipt
        demonstrates, my purchase of this Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D
        article post-dates the above statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier&#8217;s
        statement would appear to be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">So we now have evidence of two further important things to note:
        </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><b>Elsevier\u2019s
        entire system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><b>Elsevier are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Elsevier say they have gone through their
        \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D
        by paywalls. But I have just provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To be clear I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier
        of knowingly lying about this. I am going to charitably interpret this as
        an unknowingly false statement &#8211; they believe it to be true from what
        their faulty &#8220;system&#8221; tells them, but in reality it is not true,
        other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident to me that Elsevier\u2019s
        internal systems and processes for tracking invoices for APC payments, handling,
        and marking hybrid open access articles simply aren\u2019t robust. I believe
        that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence that </span><b>Elsevier
        is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access publishing</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> and that this incompetence financially benefits them through pay-per-view
        payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the scholarly poor</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege malicious intent.
        The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency </span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> demonstrably generating profits for them &#8211; that is undeniable
        and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial loss to readers who have
        paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What is
        the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite
        answer as to the extent, millions of articles are published every year, I
        can&#8217;t check them all myself. But one thing I do know and can now evidence,
        is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier don\u2019t know either</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent audit with forensic
        accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier, back in 2014 Elsevier
        self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000 to access articles that
        should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014 the rate of publication
        of hybrid open access articles has increased so I would expect if a competent
        independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019 paywalled
        articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well be in excess
        of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its paid-for hybrid
        open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported audit of
        such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent audit
        is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. I have only partially cross-checked the
        accessibility of hybrid open access articles from just </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">one</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> research funder
        at Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">there are at least 14,155 different research
        funders</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. The charge to make
        articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000 but can
        be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The
        Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> article which was
        \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error, Elsevier typically
        refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen access\u201D article
        per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would equate to a refund of
        approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still chump change to Elsevier:
        a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">annual adjusted operating profit of \xA3826
        million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126 billion</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Nor in terms
        of scale is this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen
        access\u201D articles for sale at <strike>Emerald Publishing Group</strike>

        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I stress however that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong>
        open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only fully open access publishers

        sell\u2019 articles to readers because their systems are open by default and
        do not have paywalls. At fully open access publishers, all articles are open
        and thus when an APC is paid or a fee waiver awarded, </span><b>there is </b><b><i>never</i></b><b>

        subscription-access journals going and takes good articles away from full
        open access journals. It is time to end the experiment.</span></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/pberv-kyt47\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"<strong><em>The

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"

        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day

        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central

        (or measure of central tendency) is a central or typical value for a probability

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"

        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s

        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher

        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000

        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both

        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading

        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for

        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report

        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        this has taken a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be
        OA. In 2013 you may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally
        clean up OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that
        exercise, and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our normal practice is to publish articles
        OA, but to move them back behind the firewall if after a grace period the
        invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked up as an article with an unpaid
        APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing malicious about what happened
        here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s APC, and your PPV
        charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else paid PPV for this
        article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m
        shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have just provided evidence (</span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> article) that there are more paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles
        at Elsevier that are paywalled and have been sold to readers. As my receipt
        demonstrates, my purchase of this Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D
        article post-dates the above statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier&#8217;s
        statement would appear to be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">So we now have evidence of two further important things to note:
        </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><b>Elsevier\u2019s
        entire system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><b>Elsevier are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Elsevier say they have gone through their
        \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D
        by paywalls. But I have just provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To be clear I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier
        of knowingly lying about this. I am going to charitably interpret this as
        an unknowingly false statement &#8211; they believe it to be true from what
        their faulty &#8220;system&#8221; tells them, but in reality it is not true,
        other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident to me that Elsevier\u2019s
        internal systems and processes for tracking invoices for APC payments, handling,
        and marking hybrid open access articles simply aren\u2019t robust. I believe
        that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence that </span><b>Elsevier
        is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access publishing</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> and that this incompetence financially benefits them through pay-per-view
        payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the scholarly poor</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege malicious intent.
        The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency </span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> demonstrably generating profits for them &#8211; that is undeniable
        and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial loss to readers who have
        paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What is
        the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite
        answer as to the extent, millions of articles are published every year, I
        can&#8217;t check them all myself. But one thing I do know and can now evidence,
        is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier don\u2019t know either</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent audit with forensic
        accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier, back in 2014 Elsevier
        self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000 to access articles that
        should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014 the rate of publication
        of hybrid open access articles has increased so I would expect if a competent
        independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019 paywalled
        articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well be in excess
        of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its paid-for hybrid
        open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported audit of
        such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent audit
        is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. I have only partially cross-checked the
        accessibility of hybrid open access articles from just </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">one</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> research funder
        at Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">there are at least 14,155 different research
        funders</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. The charge to make
        articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000 but can
        be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The
        Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> article which was
        \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error, Elsevier typically
        refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen access\u201D article
        per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would equate to a refund of
        approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still chump change to Elsevier:
        a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">annual adjusted operating profit of \xA3826
        million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126 billion</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Nor in terms
        of scale is this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen
        access\u201D articles for sale at <strike>Emerald Publishing Group</strike>
        (<a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/07/checking-wellcome-oa/\\\">exonerated
        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I stress however that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong>
        open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only fully open access publishers

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> that PLOS and PeerJ cannot paywall and \u2018mistakenly
        sell\u2019 articles to readers because their systems are open by default and
        do not have paywalls. At fully open access publishers, all articles are open
        and thus when an APC is paid or a fee waiver awarded, </span><b>there is </b><b><i>never</i></b><b>

        journals. Hybrid open access is demonstrably unreliable, vastly over-priced,
        and does not help towards long term goals of open access as it helps keep
        subscription-access journals going and takes good articles away from full
        open access journals.

        academic, fed-up with abysmally poor publishing services, I have decided to
        systematically run heuristic checks on articles that Wellcome Trust has paid-for
        to be open access. The Wellcome Trust and other research funders have started
        to publish detailed reports on which articles they have paid-for to be open
        access, with which publishers, and how much they paid publishers to make each
        article open access in perpetuity. I have used </span><a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/authors/Robert_Kiley/3230210\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">these public records</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        to anyone.</span></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Hi Ross,
        this has taken a little time to bottom out but indeed the article should be
        OA. In 2013 you may recall we initiated an exercise to add/correct and generally
        clean up OA license information on articles. \_This article was part of that
        exercise, and a little unusual: we had invoiced the author, and then the institution
        wanted to receive the invoice but in a different currency, so the original
        \_article invoice was unpaid during the cleaning exercise.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Our normal practice is to publish articles
        OA, but to move them back behind the firewall if after a grace period the
        invoice remains unpaid. \_So it was picked up as an article with an unpaid
        APC and moved behind the firewall. \_We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected. There\u2019s nothing malicious about what happened
        here, and we\u2019ll be reimbursing the institution\u2019s APC, and your PPV
        charge. \_We will also run a check to see if anyone else paid PPV for this
        article and if so reimburse them as well.</span></i></p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:

        the above statement from Elsevier there is something much\_more astonishing.
        Elsevier clearly wants us all to &#8220;<a href=\\\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoveAlongNothingToSeeHere\\\">move
        along, nothing to see here</a>&#8221; by stating that the <em>Mitochondrion</em>

        be.</p>\\n<h3><strong>But there <em>are</em> more paywalled open access articles

        return to Elsevier\u2019s most recent statement and you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m
        shocked:</p>\\n<h3><strong>\u201CWe\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        [the <i>Mitochondrion</i> article] is the only article affected.\u201D</strong></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have just provided evidence (</span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> article) that there are more paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D articles
        at Elsevier that are paywalled and have been sold to readers. As my receipt
        demonstrates, my purchase of this Wellcome Trust paid-for \u201Copen access\u201D
        article post-dates the above statement by Elsevier. Therefore Elsevier&#8217;s
        statement would appear to be incorrect.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">So we now have evidence of two further important things to note:
        </span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><b>Elsevier\u2019s
        entire system for handling hybrid open access is broken</b></li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><b>Elsevier are evidently incapable of accurate self-assessment</b></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Elsevier say they have gone through their
        \u201Csystem\u201D and that there are no other open access articles \u201Caffected\u201D
        by paywalls. But I have just provided clear evidence to the contrary. </span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To be clear I\u2019m not accusing Elsevier
        of knowingly lying about this. I am going to charitably interpret this as
        an unknowingly false statement &#8211; they believe it to be true from what
        their faulty &#8220;system&#8221; tells them, but in reality it is not true,
        other articles are affected. It is\_abundantly evident to me that Elsevier\u2019s
        internal systems and processes for tracking invoices for APC payments, handling,
        and marking hybrid open access articles simply aren\u2019t robust. I believe
        that this forms part of a body of mounting evidence that </span><b>Elsevier
        is professionally incompetent at hybrid open access publishing</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> and that this incompetence financially benefits them through pay-per-view
        payments &amp; re-use licensing to the detriment of </span><a href=\\\"https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/05/the-scholarly-poor-dentists/\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the scholarly poor</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> (those outside paywalls). I don\u2019t allege malicious intent.
        The point is that regardless of intent, this incompetency </span><i><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">is</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"> demonstrably generating profits for them &#8211; that is undeniable
        and that it <em>is</em> causing real harm (financial loss to readers who have
        paid for articles that should not be for sale).</span></p>\\n<h3><b>What is
        the true extent of this problem at Elsevier in 2017? Why does it matter?</b></h3>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I have to admit I don\u2019t have a definite
        answer as to the extent, millions of articles are published every year, I
        can&#8217;t check them all myself. But one thing I do know and can now evidence,
        is that </span><b>clearly Elsevier don\u2019t know either</b><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\"><strong>!</strong> I think a full independent audit with forensic
        accounting is urgently needed. Why? As I mentioned earlier, back in 2014 Elsevier
        self-disclosed that they had charged readers $70,000 to access articles that
        should have been \u201Copen access\u201D. Since 2014 the rate of publication
        of hybrid open access articles has increased so I would expect if a competent
        independent audit were done of purchases of \u2018mistakenly\u2019 paywalled
        articles between 2015 and now, the sum to be reimbursed might well be in excess
        of $100,000. Given Elsevier doesn\u2019t know that some of its paid-for hybrid
        open access articles are on sale, can we trust their self-reported audit of
        such incidences prior to 2014? I think not, hence a thorough independent audit
        is needed.</span></p>\\n<p><b>The scale of this could be very big</b><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. I have only partially cross-checked the
        accessibility of hybrid open access articles from just </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">one</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> research funder
        at Elsevier. According to CrossRef data </span><a href=\\\"http://search.crossref.org/funding\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">there are at least 14,155 different research
        funders</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. The charge to make
        articles hybrid open access at Elsevier is typically around $3000 but can
        be much more as we have seen from </span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The
        Lancet</span></i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> article which was
        \xA35,280 to make open access. When found to be in error, Elsevier typically
        refund the APC-paid, so therefore if just one \u201Copen access\u201D article
        per research funder is mistakenly paywalled, it would equate to a refund of
        approximately $42,465,000 USD. This amount is still chump change to Elsevier:
        a company that in 2013 posted an </span><a href=\\\"http://www.relx.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Documents/2013/reed_elsevier_ar_2013.pdf\\\"><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">annual adjusted operating profit of \xA3826
        million on an annual turnover of \xA32.126 billion</span></a><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Nor in terms
        of scale is this scandal confined to just Elsevier. There are paywalled \u201Copen
        access\u201D articles for sale at <strike>Emerald Publishing Group</strike>

        2017-02-27</a>), Cambridge University Press and Wolters Kluwer / LWW to name
        but a few. I have evidence, which I have already informed Wellcome Trust of.
        I don\u2019t make these claims lightly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight:
        400;\\\">I stress however that this scandal is confined to <strong>hybrid</strong>
        open access publishing.</span></p>\\n<h3><strong>Only fully open access publishers

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)

        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a

        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,

        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,

        </strong>26th February 2018</p>\\n<p><strong>Your complaint:</strong><br />\\nElsevier,
        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier&#8217;s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier&#8217;s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        to us, because we considered that the sign constituted point of sale material,
        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments

        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found

        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their

        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce

        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;

        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        malpractice</strong>. Beneath the misleading choice of presentation what we
        have in Figure 1 is a comparison between the number of citations to 60,567
        articles published by SpringerNature, split into three categories &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        have in Figure 1 is a comparison between the number of citations to 60,567

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond

        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence

        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org

        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will

        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122

        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,

        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would

        on how we can use research are simply jarring. Thanks to computers and the
        internet, we have the ability to do wonderful things, but the licensing and
        access-restrictions placed on most of the research literature explicitly and
        artificially prevent most of us from trying. As a result, few researchers
        bother thinking about using text mining techniques \u2013 it is often simpler
        and easier to just farm-out repetitive large-scale literature analysis tasks
        to an array of student minions and volunteers to do by-hand \u2013 even though
        computers could and perhaps should be doing these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span
        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate computational access to research
        has already caused us great harm. Just ask the Ministry of Health in Liberia:
        they were not pleased to discover, after a lethal Ebola virus outbreak, that

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some
        deaths during the </span><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic\\\"><span

        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation

        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of

        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the

        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their

        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce

        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude

        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other

        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.

        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the

        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge

        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading

        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive

        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for

        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this

        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,

        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*
        that was made gold open access at an SN hybrid journal is <strong>3 citations</strong>
        (across n=315 articles)</li><li>* that is paywalled at the hybrid SN journal

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at
        the fully open access journal <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\">SciPost
        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running
        costs famously amount to<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18351?proof=t\\\">less

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
        that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
        institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals,
        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always

        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal

        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal

        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"reference\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable

        am highly curious as to why Elsevier\_do not seem to be responding to emails

        <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/\\\">public GOAL
        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding
        readers across the world by charging them to access content that has been
        paid-for to be open access.</p>\\n<p>Below\_is the full content of <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004391.html\\\">my
        message</a>\_to the list, nicely formatted for clarity. I re-publish it here
        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want
        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-saferedirecturl=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1488317697512000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdiPrUlRe5TnUSRimHKyQtE9c_yw\\\">http://openapc.github.io/gener<wbr
        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day

        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for

        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running
        costs famously amount to<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18351?proof=t\\\">less

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
        that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
        institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals,
        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC
        registry</a>. In the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/\\\">2021
        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to

        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"

        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA

        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence

        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research

        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier&#8217;s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier&#8217;s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising

        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        Oxford University Press,</p>\\n<p>The problems at Oxford University Press
        (OUP) journals have been<br />\\ngoing-on far too long.</p>\\n<p>It is affecting
        our ability to do research.</p>\\n<p>OUP have known about these problems since
        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation
        is simply outrageous.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of over 50 signatories representing
        postdocs, principal<br />\\ninvestigators, professors, and others from institutions
        around the<br />\\nworld, <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1syhN3heTAn1v5UYzjwP8JS124PNr27ecq59CkDplX3g/edit?usp=sharing\\\">I
        attach a formal open letter of complaint about the abysmal </a><br />\\nservice
        being provided by OUP, in the hope that OUP might finally<br />\\nprovide
        adequate responses to the various problems detailed therein.</p>\\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\\n<p>Dr

        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal

        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at

        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        are to name but a few of these exciting approaches. Computational power and
        storage capacity are not the limiting factors on what we could do with the
        100 million or so journal articles that comprise the ever-growing research
        literature so far.\\n\",\"tags\":[\"Generation Open\",\"Open Access\"],\"title\":\"Open

        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at

        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when

        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques
        \u2013 it is often simpler and easier to just farm-out repetitive large-scale
        literature analysis tasks to an array of student minions and volunteers to
        do by-hand \u2013 even though computers could and perhaps should be doing
        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to

        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors

        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 are all textbook examples of misleading statistical
        malpractice</strong>. Beneath the misleading choice of presentation what we
        have in Figure 1 is a comparison between the number of citations to 60,567
        articles published by SpringerNature, split into three categories &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;
        , &#8220;EarlyV&#8221;, and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;.  The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;
        bar represents data about 44,557 articles, the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; bar represents
        data about 8,350 articles, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; bar represents data
        about 7,660 articles. Let&#8217;s have a look at the actual data shall we?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own

        felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising was misleading because it did not accurately
        reflect the price range of their products and they do not quote prices with
        VAT.\_ Please note that we have only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded
        to us, because we considered that the sign constituted point of sale material,
        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments
        such as yours help us to understand the issues that matter to consumers and
        we will keep a record of your complaint on file for use in future monitoring.

        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques

        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility

        for gold: exploring the reach and impact of Gold open access articles in hybrid
        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*
        that was made gold open access at an SN hybrid journal is <strong>3 citations</strong>
        (across n=315 articles)</li><li>* that is paywalled at the hybrid SN journal

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at
        the fully open access journal <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\">SciPost
        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
        that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
        institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals,
        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC
        registry</a>. In the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/\\\">2021
        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        Me</strong></p>\\n<p>When the job ad came-up I could scarcely believe how
        good the organisational fit was for me: Arcadia funds brilliant\_projects
        in this space. I am genuinely looking forward to developing and advising on
        Arcadia\u2019s open access policy, to <em>continue</em> engaging with the
        wider open access community, to manage Arcadia&#8217;s existing grants portfolio,
        and to identify new opportunities for high impact initiatives where funding
        from Arcadia will make a difference.</p>\\n<p>I feel extremely grateful to
        have been chosen for this position against many other talented and experienced
        applicants (and friends!) and although it&#8217;ll take me many months to
        &#8216;learn the ropes&#8217; I see this as my new career now, no going back.
        I&#8217;m now part of the <a href=\\\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7608/full/534475c.html\\\">88%
        majority of UK postdocs who never secure a tenured position in academia</a>;
        but don&#8217;t feel sorry for me &#8211; I&#8217;m delighted with this new
        direction. New career, same me.</p>\\n<p>A lot of passionate, intelligent
        young people with an academic background have jobs where they can really\_make
        a difference (i.e. <em>not</em> in academia). In this regard, I&#8217;m inspired

        <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/\\\">public GOAL
        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding
        readers across the world by charging them to access content that has been
        paid-for to be open access.</p>\\n<p>Below\_is the full content of <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004391.html\\\">my

        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want
        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"

        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"

        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this

        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA

        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs

        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable

        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would

        paid-for to be open access.</p>\\n<p>Below\_is the full content of <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004391.html\\\">my
        message</a>\_to the list, nicely formatted for clarity. I re-publish it here
        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want
        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility

        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments

        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would

        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation
        is simply outrageous.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of over 50 signatories representing

        <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/\\\">public GOAL
        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding
        readers across the world by charging them to access content that has been

        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude

        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day

        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility

        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for

        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running
        costs famously amount to<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18351?proof=t\\\">less

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
        that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
        institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals,
        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC
        registry</a>. In the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/\\\">2021
        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on

        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report

        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to

        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors

        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I

        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the

        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier&#8217;s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier&#8217;s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        Oxford University Press,</p>\\n<p>The problems at Oxford University Press
        (OUP) journals have been<br />\\ngoing-on far too long.</p>\\n<p>It is affecting
        our ability to do research.</p>\\n<p>OUP have known about these problems since
        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation
        is simply outrageous.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of over 50 signatories representing
        postdocs, principal<br />\\ninvestigators, professors, and others from institutions
        around the<br />\\nworld, <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1syhN3heTAn1v5UYzjwP8JS124PNr27ecq59CkDplX3g/edit?usp=sharing\\\">I
        attach a formal open letter of complaint about the abysmal </a><br />\\nservice
        being provided by OUP, in the hope that OUP might finally<br />\\nprovide

        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at

        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        then with regard to costs?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>arXiv\u2019s running

        that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable in the long-run and
        that arXiv sorely more financial support</a> from the world\u2019s research
        institutions]</li><li>By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature physics journals,
        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal

        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics

        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at

        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />al/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier<wbr />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m
        struggling to reconcile what I have found and what Christoph might have found
        with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the
        system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The most likely
        conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these reports that
        appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s system is
        not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations

        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to

        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques
        \u2013 it is often simpler and easier to just farm-out repetitive large-scale
        literature analysis tasks to an array of student minions and volunteers to
        do by-hand \u2013 even though computers could and perhaps should be doing
        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors

        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        malpractice</strong>. Beneath the misleading choice of presentation what we
        have in Figure 1 is a comparison between the number of citations to 60,567
        articles published by SpringerNature, split into three categories &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;

        data about 8,350 articles, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; bar represents data
        about 7,660 articles. Let&#8217;s have a look at the actual data shall we?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own

        felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising was misleading because it did not accurately
        reflect the price range of their products and they do not quote prices with
        VAT.\_ Please note that we have only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded
        to us, because we considered that the sign constituted point of sale material,
        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments
        such as yours help us to understand the issues that matter to consumers and

        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at

        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        found and what Christoph might have found with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The
        most likely conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these
        reports that appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s
        system is not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility

        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at

        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.

        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        Baldwin</a> and <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbet_Rausing\\\">Lisbet
        Rausing</a> in 2002. So far, it has awarded more than $440 million to cultural,
        environmental and open access projects. Within the open access funding programme
        Arcadia have awarded grants to organisations including Creative Commons, Wikimedia

        good the organisational fit was for me: Arcadia funds brilliant\_projects
        in this space. I am genuinely looking forward to developing and advising on
        Arcadia\u2019s open access policy, to <em>continue</em> engaging with the
        wider open access community, to manage Arcadia&#8217;s existing grants portfolio,
        and to identify new opportunities for high impact initiatives where funding
        from Arcadia will make a difference.</p>\\n<p>I feel extremely grateful to
        have been chosen for this position against many other talented and experienced
        applicants (and friends!) and although it&#8217;ll take me many months to
        &#8216;learn the ropes&#8217; I see this as my new career now, no going back.

        <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/\\\">public GOAL
        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding
        readers across the world by charging them to access content that has been
        paid-for to be open access.</p>\\n<p>Below\_is the full content of <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004391.html\\\">my
        message</a>\_to the list, nicely formatted for clarity. I re-publish it here
        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want
        justice for the many unknown readers who may have been defrauded by paying
        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m struggling to reconcile what I have
        found and what Christoph might have found with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The
        most likely conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these
        reports that appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s
        system is not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a

        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis

        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to

        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both

        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for

        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of

        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page

        found and what Christoph might have found with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve

        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        Archive</a>. Even if one or two of these repositories goes down, it&#8217;s
        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more
        than OA content only available in one place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least

        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like? It might save you a lot of anguish.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/dy0m6-g3170\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2278\",\"id\":\"fb067113-7046-4cfc-8a1b-a8cf6246eaef\",\"image\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1700434867,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"This

        statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central
        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        mailing list</a>, I wrote to Dr Alicia Wise (Director of Access and Policy
        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m struggling to reconcile what I have
        found and what Christoph might have found with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The
        most likely conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these
        reports that appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s
        system is not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        you may have seen in the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/personal-data-stolen-in-british-library-cyber-attack-appears-for-sale-online\\\">news</a>,
        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published

        1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 are all textbook examples of misleading statistical
        malpractice</strong>. Beneath the misleading choice of presentation what we
        have in Figure 1 is a comparison between the number of citations to 60,567
        articles published by SpringerNature, split into three categories &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;
        , &#8220;EarlyV&#8221;, and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;.  The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;

        data about 8,350 articles, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; bar represents data
        about 7,660 articles. Let&#8217;s have a look at the actual data shall we?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\">t
        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        illiterate wa</a>y), perhaps SpringerNature just decided to run with it anyway,

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own

        felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising was misleading because it did not accurately
        reflect the price range of their products and they do not quote prices with
        VAT.\_ Please note that we have only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded
        to us, because we considered that the sign constituted point of sale material,
        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments
        such as yours help us to understand the issues that matter to consumers and
        we will keep a record of your complaint on file for use in future monitoring.

        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques

        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        at Elsevier), about how\_Elsevier&#8217;s paywall systems are wrongly defrauding

        because I am <em>still</em> seeking answers to my questions, and I still want

        to access content that should instead have been &#8220;open access&#8221;
        to all.</p>\\n<p>I remind readers that the scale of this is not trivial at
        all. Elsevier themselves admit in 2014 they attempted to refund or credit
        <a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/connect/open-access-the-systems-journey\\\">&#8220;about
        $70,000&#8221; to readers who had been wrongly charged for open access content</a>.</p>\\n<p>&#8212;</p>\\n<p>Dear
        <span class=\\\"il\\\">Alicia</span>,<br />\\nApproximately <a href=\\\"http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/pipermail/goal/2017-February/004378.html\\\">five
        days ago you wrote on behalf of Elsevier</a> to this mailing list in response
        to my finding of a single <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/14/elsevier-selling-access-to-open-access-again/\\\">paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and actively being sold
        at the Elsevier journal <i>Mitochondrion</i></a>.</p>\\n<p>In the response
        Elsevier sought to re-assure the world (open access is for the benefit of
        everyone) that:</p>\\n<p><b>&#8220;We\u2019ve gone through the system, this
        is the only article affected.&#8221;</b></p>\\n<p>I then found another paid-for
        hybrid &#8220;open access&#8221; article paywalled and <a href=\\\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/2017/02/20/hybrid-open-access-is-unreliable/\\\">actively
        being sold at the Elsevier journal <i>The Lancet</i></a>.</p>\\n<p><b>We appear
        to have had no official response from Elsevier since.</b></p>\\n<p>Today,
        an independent analysis by Christoph Broschinski of more paid-for hybridOA
        articles at Elsevier journals may have found up to five additional paywalled,
        for sale articles. The Cambridge one is a mistake, the payment was for page
        charges &amp; colour figures not open access, I have done due diligence on
        this and checked myself since I am at Cambridge.\_<a href=\\\"http://openapc.github.io/general/openapc/2017/02/23/elsevier_hybrid_access/\\\"

        />_hybrid_access/</a></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m struggling to reconcile what I have
        found and what Christoph might have found with Elsevier&#8217;s statement:</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve
        gone through the system, this is the only article affected.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><b>The
        most likely conclusion I can draw from Elsevier&#8217;s statement and these
        reports that appear to conflict with that statement is that Elsevier&#8217;s
        system is not adequately tracking paid-for hybridOA articles.\_</b></p>\\n<p>Assuming
        this to be true:</p>\\n<p>1.) <b>Will Elsevier openly publish on a single
        web page, on a continuous, ongoing basis, the exact DOIs of all articles that
        Elsevier has been paid to make &#8220;hybridOA&#8221;</b> , including the
        DOIs of articles that Elsevier were paid to make open access, that now reside
        at journals published by other publishers (if the journal was subsequently
        transferred to another publisher) ?</p>\\n<p>This will enable any interested
        party to:</p>\\n<p>a) Check that each and every one is actually freely accessible
        from the publisher site landing page</p>\\n<p>b) This &#8216;master list&#8217;
        of Elsevier hybridOA can be cross-checked against institutionally-held lists
        of paid invoices. Any articles listed by an institution as paid-for OA, but
        not on Elsevier&#8217;s hybridOA &#8216;master list&#8217; can be further
        investigated, to perhaps further reveal more articles that should be &#8220;open
        access&#8221; that Elsevier&#8217;s faulty &#8220;system&#8221; has overlooked.</p>\\n<p>2.)
        <b>Will Elsevier refund 100% of the paid APC to each institution, funder,
        or individual that has a wrongly paywalled paid-for &#8220;open access&#8221;
        article behind a paywall?</b></p>\\n<p>3.) <b>Will Elsevier hire and fully
        pay for an independent 3rd party forensic accounting firm to go through their
        pay-per-view and re-use licensing data/systems and records</b>, including
        the period from January 1st 2005 until today (23rd February 2017), to produce
        a thorough openly available report on the extent of PPV payments AND re-use
        licensing payments for articles that should not have been sold to access,
        or to re-use?</p>\\n<p>I hope Elsevier will do this to ensure that every individual
        who has paid to access or re-use &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; paywalled &#8220;open
        access&#8221; material is refunded in full, with interest, including the local
        taxes applied not just the article fee, and not with &#8220;credit&#8221;
        that can only be used to purchase other Elsevier goods or services.</p>\\n<p>4.)
        <b>What meaningful assurances can Elsevier give that it will not make these
        mistakes again, given that it appears to be making these mistakes over and
        over again?</b></p>\\n<p>Full open access publishers have an error rate of
        precisely 0 out of over &gt;500,000 articles published so far e.g. PLOS, PeerJ
        and eLife.</p>\\n<p>Errors such as these are simply intolerable and have the
        potential to cause great harm.<br />\\nFor instance, imagine if an article
        providing the first report of Ebola in Peru was paid-for to be hybridOA but
        was instead mistakenly paywalled&#8230;<br />\\nSince Peru is now &#8220;too
        rich&#8221; [1] to qualify for HINARI, but still too poor to pay to subscribe
        to most subscription journals, many Peruvians would not have access to this
        vital information unless it was open access.</p>\\n<p>c.f. the first report
        of Ebola in Liberia which was also infamously paywalled at an Elsevier journal

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have

        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I

        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier&#8217;s online price list which I downloaded
        from Elsevier&#8217;s official website here:\_<a href=\\\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/pricing\\\"

        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some

        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        Oxford University Press,</p>\\n<p>The problems at Oxford University Press
        (OUP) journals have been<br />\\ngoing-on far too long.</p>\\n<p>It is affecting
        our ability to do research.</p>\\n<p>OUP have known about these problems since
        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation
        is simply outrageous.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of over 50 signatories representing
        postdocs, principal<br />\\ninvestigators, professors, and others from institutions
        around the<br />\\nworld, <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1syhN3heTAn1v5UYzjwP8JS124PNr27ecq59CkDplX3g/edit?usp=sharing\\\">I
        attach a formal open letter of complaint about the abysmal </a><br />\\nservice
        being provided by OUP, in the hope that OUP might finally<br />\\nprovide
        adequate responses to the various problems detailed therein.</p>\\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\\n<p>Dr

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.
        Edits, additions, and corrections to this dataset are very welcome. <br><br>I
        think 1600 journals is more than &#8216;a few&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some
        interesting examples of fee free, society affiliated journals are shown below,
        just for illustration. They are arbitrarily chosen by me, and are not necessarily
        a representative sample:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-table\\\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from

        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors

        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations

        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals

        Irish IREL consortium agreement</a> with Springer Nature, Irish institutions
        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to

        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        methods to help us analyse large volumes of text. Sentiment analysis, topic

        approaches. Computational power and storage capacity are not the limiting
        factors on what we could do with the 100 million or so journal articles that

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques
        \u2013 it is often simpler and easier to just farm-out repetitive large-scale
        literature analysis tasks to an array of student minions and volunteers to
        do by-hand \u2013 even though computers could and perhaps should be doing
        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate
        computational access to research has already caused us great harm. Just ask
        the Ministry of Health in Liberia: they were not pleased to discover, after
        a lethal Ebola virus outbreak, that </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/opinion/yes-we-were-warned-about-ebola.html\\\"><span

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some
        deaths during the </span><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic\\\"><span

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had
        as a peer-reviewer, reviewing a manuscript where the experimental design was
        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        journals</a>\u201D by Christina Emery, Mithu Lucraft, Jessica Monaghan, David
        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        (across n=838 articles)</li><li>* that is neither open access at the journal,
        nor publicly accessible via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories
        is <strong>2 citations</strong> (for n=2103)</li><li>* (this data is not provided
        by SpringerNature, my own analysis) for the 111 papers published in 2018 at

        Physics</a>, which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of
        citations is <strong>10 citations</strong></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From examining
        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.

        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        heard of it before here&#8217;s what you need to know: Arcadia is a charitable

        Baldwin</a> and <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbet_Rausing\\\">Lisbet
        Rausing</a> in 2002. So far, it has awarded more than $440 million to cultural,
        environmental and open access projects. Within the open access funding programme
        Arcadia have awarded grants to organisations including Creative Commons, Wikimedia
        Foundation, Authors Alliance,\_Public.Resource.Org,\_Internet Archive,\_Digital
        Public Library of America and more&#8230;</p>\\n<p><strong>New Career, Same
        Me</strong></p>\\n<p>When the job ad came-up I could scarcely believe how
        good the organisational fit was for me: Arcadia funds brilliant\_projects
        in this space. I am genuinely looking forward to developing and advising on
        Arcadia\u2019s open access policy, to <em>continue</em> engaging with the
        wider open access community, to manage Arcadia&#8217;s existing grants portfolio,
        and to identify new opportunities for high impact initiatives where funding
        from Arcadia will make a difference.</p>\\n<p>I feel extremely grateful to
        have been chosen for this position against many other talented and experienced
        applicants (and friends!) and although it&#8217;ll take me many months to
        &#8216;learn the ropes&#8217; I see this as my new career now, no going back.

        young people with an academic background have jobs where they can really\_make
        a difference (i.e. <em>not</em> in academia). In this regard, I&#8217;m inspired

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.
        Edits, additions, and corrections to this dataset are very welcome. <br><br>I
        think 1600 journals is more than &#8216;a few&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some
        interesting examples of fee free, society affiliated journals are shown below,
        just for illustration. They are arbitrarily chosen by me, and are not necessarily

        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the

        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research

        articles published by SpringerNature, split into three categories &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;
        , &#8220;EarlyV&#8221;, and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;.  The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221;

        data about 8,350 articles, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; bar represents data
        about 7,660 articles. Let&#8217;s have a look at the actual data shall we?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,

        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.

        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis

        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>
        to just $2690 in <em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy</em>, <strong>the
        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals
        is $2780</strong></li><li>Alternatively, one could calculate the cost of hybrid
        gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained within \u2018transformative
        agreement\u2019 big deals as listed at the <a href=\\\"https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/\\\">ESAC

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,
        which if we convert that from Euros to USD is <strong>$2727.80 per article</strong>.</li><li>Another
        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the
        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I understand from your complaint that you
        felt that\_Elsevier\u2019s advertising was misleading because it did not accurately
        reflect the price range of their products and they do not quote prices with
        VAT.\_ Please note that we have only reviewed the leaflet which you forwarded
        to us, because we considered that the sign constituted point of sale material,
        which is not covered by our Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We
        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising
        Rules that we apply and I am writing to let you know that we have taken steps
        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising
        complies with the Codes.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Comments
        such as yours help us to understand the issues that matter to consumers and
        we will keep a record of your complaint on file for use in future monitoring.

        am thrilled that the Advertising Standards Authority has officially upheld
        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems with Elsevier&#8217;s
        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques
        \u2013 it is often simpler and easier to just farm-out repetitive large-scale
        literature analysis tasks to an array of student minions and volunteers to

        these analyses for us. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Inadequate
        computational access to research has already caused us great harm. Just ask

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early
        warning that Ebola could come to Liberia, which might have prevented some
        deaths during the </span><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic\\\"><span

        access APIs, and their associated restrictions. Furthermore, OA publishers
        typically provide highly structured full-text XML files which make it even
        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that
        many of the best text-mining researchers operate-on and enrich our understanding
        of open access papers-</span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">only</span></i><span

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.

        interesting examples of fee free, society affiliated journals are shown below,

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"

        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is

        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\">the

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.
        Edits, additions, and corrections to this dataset are very welcome. <br><br>I

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University

        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,
        and <em>PCI Registered Reports</em> is one of the communities that will provide
        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance

        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)

        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.
        Edits, additions, and corrections to this dataset are very welcome. <br><br>I
        think 1600 journals is more than &#8216;a few&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some
        interesting examples of fee free, society affiliated journals are shown below,
        just for illustration. They are arbitrarily chosen by me, and are not necessarily
        a representative sample:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-table\\\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL

        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of

        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        thing that spurred me to join is a rather unsatisfactory experience I had

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        that service for you, for free! </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would love to see more
        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research

        or typical value for a probability distribution. Colloquially, measures of
        central tendency are often called averages. The most common measures of central
        tendency are the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean\\\">arithmetic
        mean</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\\">median</a>,

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.
        <a href=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies\\\">SpringerNature
        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">Part
        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        covered by that agreement will pay \u20AC2,410 per article for open access,

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own
        data (!) actually demonstrates this.</p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:

        am thrilled that the Advertising Standards Authority has officially upheld
        my complaint, and I encourage others who notice similar problems with Elsevier&#8217;s
        business practices, and that of other academic publishers to come forward
        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators
        to start seriously investigating complaints about these richly profitable
        publishing companies with <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier\\\">dubious

        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research
        literature explicitly and artificially prevent most of us from trying. As
        a result, few researchers bother thinking about using text mining techniques

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early

        easier for text miners. But only a small fraction of the research literature
        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have
        a particular interest in are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>a) the ISSN National Centre
        for the UK: <a href=\\\"https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html\\\">https://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/issn.html</a><br>b)
        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from
        the <a href=\\\"https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/comparative-cladistics-fossils-morphological-data-partitions-and-\\\">University
        of Bath institutional repository</a>, <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/7sa6d\\\">Thesis

        highly likely that my thesis will always be accessible from somewhere on the
        internet 24/7, no matter what. Posting content in multiple independently-run
        places gives others access to that content in a highly <em>resilient</em>
        way. It is also worth mentioning, there is a <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551510389358\\\">study</a>
        suggesting that OA content made available in multiple places gets cited more

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies
        before they get carried out, written-up, and submitted. Reducing research
        waste AND increasing the quality of research that ends-up getting published
        &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence

        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        Stuart, and Susie Winter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer Nature present cherry-picked
        analyses with an experimental design of their choosing, of 60,567 articles
        published in 1,262 of their \u2018hybrid\u2019 journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What
        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A
        closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints posted at arXiv, for physics
        papers</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Leaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months
        [if published 2018-12-31] ), in an SN hybrid journal:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>*

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.
        citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, <a href=\\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129\\\">Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        &#8216;open access citation advantage&#8217; (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis
        points out that most of them are poorly done</a>. This &#8216;Going for Gold&#8217;
        SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed studies. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What

        hybrid gold APCs vary from $4480 in <em>The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review</em>

        median list price per article to enable open access in SN hybrid Physics journals

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a
        complete listing of open access journals, as is well documented in &#8216;<a
        href=\\\"https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/oa-diamond-journals-study/\\\">The
        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.
        [e.g. <em>grep -i &#8216;society&#8217; DOAJdata.csv | wc -l</em> ]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word
        &#8216;Society&#8217; in the journal title but is not actually published-for
        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata
        item on &#8216;learned society&#8217;</a> (Q955824) for trustworthy translations

        casting the net wide for societies and associations, I ended up finding over
        1600 journals which both charge authors and readers no fees (diamond) AND
        are associated with a learned society. For transparency, I have uploaded this
        list of society associated, diamond open access journals to github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rossmounce/Society-DiamondOA-Journals/blob/main/doaj-diamond-society-journals.csv\\\">here</a>.
        Edits, additions, and corrections to this dataset are very welcome. <br><br>I
        think 1600 journals is more than &#8216;a few&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some
        interesting examples of fee free, society affiliated journals are shown below,

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL
        staff. As has been <a href=\\\"https://hcommons.social/@mia/111483661298025928\\\">observed</a>,
        public services can be a relatively easy target.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of
        the very wide variety of digital services that the BL provide, that I have

        the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS): <a href=\\\"http://ethos.bl.uk/\\\">http://ethos.bl.uk/</a>
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202
        . In more normal times it would be publicly available via this link: <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022\\\">https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642022</a>
        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed
        under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence, and copies of it can be
        uploaded wherever I want. As a consequence, my thesis is also available from

        got me thinking again about the major &#8216;Atyponocalypse&#8217; downtime
        event of 17th December 2020. Do you remember it? I certainly do (the screenshot
        above is from that event). The journal hosting platforms of SAGE, ACS Publications,
        Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis and many others all simultaneously went offline
        for roughly a 24 hour period because of an error at <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon\\\">Atypon</a>,
        the publishing platform that many different legacy publishers use. It was
        unprecedented. People were rightly going nuts about it. Huge swathes of important
        knowledge were made almost completely digitally unavailable, worldwide. I
        like how <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/brie_marina/status/1339566698408669185\\\">Brie</a>
        put it, at the time:<br><br>&#8220;One day left for student finals and Wiley&#8217;s
        (AnthroSource, etc) sites are all down for maintenance. What are the upsides
        to mergers and consolidations of academic knowledge again?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;1,600
        journals and 22,000 books unavailable with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WileyDown?src=hashtag_click\\\">#WileyDown</a>&#8221;
        (and that was the numbers for just <em>one</em> publisher)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        interesting thing about the Atypon 2020 downtime event was that for much of
        the content affected, there was no alternative, legal platform hosting the
        content in parallel.  Nor could people put online temporary copies to help
        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because
        of the copyright restrictions on that content. Many of the legacy publishers,
        for their paywalled journals (only), still have this major single-point-of-failure
        weakness.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But open access content does NOT suffer these
        weaknesses.<br><br>As I allude to in the title of this post. The key differentiators
        here in open access systems, that make open access more resilient to downtime
        overall are a) availability on multiple independent platforms and b) open
        licencing that makes it legally easier to host content in multiple places.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools
        such as Google Scholar, <a href=\\\"https://openalex.org/\\\">OpenAlex</a>,
        and <a href=\\\"https://www.base-search.net/\\\">BASE</a> can signpost the
        way to where these alternative copies live. Research can stay openly accessible
        24/7, 365 days a year, if only we let it be openly-licensed and thus easy
        to host on multiple platforms.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even if individual repositories
        or open access publishers (e.g. <a href=\\\"https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/09/07/shared-infrastructure-downtime-michigan/\\\">Michigan</a>
        recently) experience some downtime through cyberattacks or &#8216;unplanned
        maintainence&#8217;, the global collective network of repositories can ensure
        that the scholarship remains accessible 24/7, albeit in different locations.
        \ <strong>The next time you see a paywalled journal experiencing some significant
        downtime, please let me know.</strong> I think there are some very interesting
        natural obervation experiments that could be done around these events to tease
        out the differences in impact between open-licensed and &#8216;all rights
        reserved&#8217; content.  Does anyone maintain a wiki or database of major
        downtime events at academic publishers? There have been quite a few already&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        deeply insufficient. I won&#8217;t reveal for which open access journal I
        reviewed, or the full content of my peer review report but the gist of it
        was (quoting from my report, my words):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;this
        [name of OA journal redacted] manuscript has an inadequate sample size to
        draw conclusions from. Sampling only 152 journals out of a total population
        of ~4594 SCIE-indexed biology journals, equates to just a 3.3% sample size
        (152/4594). I see no reason why the authors couldn\u2019t have taken at least
        a 10% sample (over 459 journals). Prior work on open access citation advantage
        such as Ghane et al (2020) did their work on a sample of 1881 journals indexed
        in DOAJ (DOAJ at the time indexed a total of ~11,000 journals; Ghane et al
        (2020) achieved a greater than 10% sample size).</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Furthermore,
        the choice of how which journals were sampled was by their own account in
        a non-random and arbitrary manner. Students merely _chose_ a journal to download
        data on. This is highly subjective and prone to bias. As an example of one
        possible bias introduced: if I were a student, I might be tempted to choose
        a journal with a low article volume so that it would be less work/time to
        complete the assignment&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\\n<cite>Ross Mounce (2023)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TL;DR
        the experimental design was deeply flawed. Although I appreciate the authors
        put a lot of work into it, the conclusions of their work were just not valid,
        given the problems of their experimental design. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The experience
        as a reviewer was like arriving at the scene of a car crash six months too
        late to stop the accident. To change this piece of work into one with an acceptable
        experimental design at this point would be a LOT of new work and might require
        throwing away much of the existing data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s clear
        to me that a lot of researchers are now trying their hand at metaresearch,
        research on research, journalology, and open access studies &#8212; whatever
        you call it. That&#8217;s great. But I implore folks to seriously consider
        getting their experimental design peer-reviewed BEFORE they start their study,

        stage 1 registered reports in metaresearch, to catch improperly designed studies

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,
        the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set has a skew of 6.0, and the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;
        set has a skew of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed.
        This level of skew is absolutely to be expected.  Per Seglen (1992) termed
        the typical skew of journal citation distributions &#8220;<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0\\\"

        skewness of science</a>&#8220;. Any decent statistician will tell you that
        you should not represent the central tendency of a highly skewed distribution
        with the mean and yet this is exactly what the authors of the SN white paper
        have chosen to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A more statistically appropriate representation
        of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile ranges, and the
        median. Here&#8217;s how that looks (the black bar indicates the median, which
        is 4 citations for &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; and &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; and is 6
        citations for &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image

        their credit, they do display a boxplot analysis of this data but I can&#8217;t
        help but notice that they stick it in the Appendix as Figure 4 on page 19
        of the PDF! They choose a log-scale for the y-axis whereas here I prefer a
        normal scale, albeit that choice means that outlier papers with &gt;30 citations
        are not shown.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Am I concerned about the 2 citation difference
        in medians, over a period of ~3 years, between &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; (Green
        OA) and &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; (expensive hybrid gold open access at the journal)?
        No. Why?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1.) SN massively <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\">cherry-picked</a>
        their sample choosing only 38.5% of the full research articles they could
        have otherwise included. If we add back-in the articles they chose to exclude
        who knows what the picture will actually look like. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2.)
        There&#8217;s a huge unaddressed flaw in the &#8220;white paper&#8221; methodology
        with respect to author manuscripts made publicly available at repositories.

        hybrid journals set an &#8217;embargo&#8217; of either 6 months or 12 months
        </a>depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance
        of an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal
        (their &#8220;Gold OA&#8221;), with the citation performance of an article
        which has a parallel copy publicly available only 365 days after the publication
        date, gives the &#8220;EarlyV&#8221; set much less time for the purported
        open access benefit to take effect. Effectively it&#8217;s an unfair comparison
        where the &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; set has been given an additional year or six
        months extra to accrue citations relative to the eventual public emergence
        of green OA author manuscripts.  But with the advent of the <a href=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\">Rights
        Retention Strategy</a> whereby author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day
        embargo we may eventually be able to do a &#8216;fairer&#8217; analysis between
        the citation benefit of open access provided either at the journal (&#8220;Gold&#8221;)
        or at a repository (&#8220;Green&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3.) SN failed
        to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated with
        &#8220;Gold OA&#8221; e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced
        as the most expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils<a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"

        the Max Planck Digital Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature $11,200
        for some articles</a>, the rest of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom.
        There also seems no cap on the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid
        OA options over time. At current prices, even for &#8216;cheaper&#8217; SN
        hybrid journals, most research institutions simply cannot afford to pay for
        hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature for all their articles. Even if
        it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit over a three year period, is
        it worth $2780 per article? I think not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5.) Fully open
        access journals of which <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ</a>
        are typically both lower in price and often higher in citation performance
        per article as I demonstrated with <em>SciPost Physics</em> in <a href=\\\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/\\\"

        1 of this series</a>.<br><br>All that SpringerNature have demonstrated with
        their white paper is alarming statistical illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility
        and transparency. Given how popular measures like Clarivate&#8217;s Journal
        Impact Factor are (which is also calculated in a <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\"

        is a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journal?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A \u2018hybrid\u2019
        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),
        institution, or funder pays a fee (APC) to ensure permanent openness of an
        individual article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(2)
        the journal grants a fee waiver and gives permanent open access to an individual
        article with a Creative Commons license,</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>or</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(3)
        the journal just turns off the paywall on an individual article at whim without
        author-side payment, without a Creative Commons license, and importantly without
        any assurance of permanence of the turned-off paywall state (so called \u2018<a
        href=\\\"https://peerj.com/articles/4375/\\\">bronze OA</a>\u2019).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Springer
        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience
        of governments, policymakers, and researchers that they should focus their
        efforts (funding $$$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather than green OA
        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to
        do their analysis, do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of:
        which intervention has more impact \u2018gold OA\u2019 or \u2018green OA\u2019
        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022
        138,449/157,333 (88%) of the articles were identified as being published in
        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles
        had a corresponding author that had an<br>identifiable THE institutional ranking
        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\">this paper</a> (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\">the
        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">
        from figshare</a> under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list
        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. &#8216;Physics&#8217; we can observe from the dataset
        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when
        assessed in November 2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years
        and 10 months [if published 2018-01-01] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months

        the data SN provide, the citation difference between gold OA and green OA
        as routes to achieving public access to research is negligible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Providing
        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from
        a theoretical perspective could clearly create more measurable impact (e.g.

        interesting comparator group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence
        of <strong>fully open access journals</strong>. The SN whitepaper chose to
        provide analysis exclusively of &#8216;hybrid&#8217; journals. A suitable
        physics journal that enables open access at the journal for all articles is
        <em>SciPost Physics</em>. According to <a href=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\">their
        data</a>, it costs them about <strong>620 euros per article (~ $700 USD)</strong>,
        and their model is such that there is no author-facing charge (no APC).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So,
        policymakers; when faced with a choice of enabling public access to research
        via \u2018green\u2019 routes such as arXiv or fully open access journals such
        as <em>SciPost Physics</em> or hybrid \u2018gold\u2019 routes such as SpringerNature
        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always
        come out as <a href=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"

        most expensive</a> and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards.
        Spending money on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature&#8217;s own

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer

        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_text\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        </strong>26th February 2018</p>\\n<p><strong>Your complaint:</strong><br />\\nElsevier,
        a large academic publishing company, have flyers and a large poster, both
        containing the same information at the <a href=\\\"https://r2rconf.com/\\\">Researcher
        to Reader Conference</a> (British Medical Association House, London). They
        claim on both the flyers and the poster that &#8220;Fact #2: Our APC prices
        are value for money Our APC prices range from $150 &#8211; $5000 US dollars&#8230;&#8221;
        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
        as this meeting is in the UK. UK customers choosing this service would have
        to pay the APC plus VAT tax and so the prices should be displayed inclusive
        of taxes in adverts like this. There is no mention of the need to pay VAT
        on either the flyers or the poster. I went to their website the same day and
        found thirteen journals published at Elsevier, that by Elsevier&#8217;s own
        price list charge $5200 US dollars, not including VAT. Those journals are:
        <em>Cancer Cell, Cell, Cell Chemical Biology, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Cell
        Metabolism, Cell Stem Cell, Cell Systems, Current Biology, Developmental Cell,
        Immunity, Molecular Cell, Neuron</em>, and <em>Structure</em>. For reference
        I have attached a PDF of Elsevier&#8217;s online price list which I downloaded

        have concluded that the leaflet was likely to have breached the Advertising

        to address this.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\_have explained\_your
        concerns to the advertiser and provided guidance to them on the areas that
        require attention, together with advice on how to ensure that their advertising

        with further complaints. These companies are not immune to regulation &#8211;
        they must abide by the law at all times. The punishment for now is just a
        slap-on-the-wrist but if they are consistently caught misadvertising, stronger
        punishments can and would be meted out. Perhaps now is the time for more regulators

        Thanks to computers and the internet, we have the ability to do wonderful
        things, but the licensing and access-restrictions placed on most of the research

        This information wasn\u2019t in the title, keywords, metadata, or abstract;
        it was completely hidden behind a paywall. Full text mining approaches would
        have easily found this buried knowledge and would have provided vital early

        is openly-licensed open access. It\u2019s for these reasons and more that

        mid-January yet so many<br />\\ncritical problems still remain unresolved.
        Where is all the<br />\\nsupplementary materials for MBE and GBE? Where are
        the &#8220;missing&#8221; 16<br />\\nyears worth of full text MBE articles?</p>\\n<p>Providing
        access to research is the most basic job of a publisher,<br />\\nyet OUP are
        failing to do even this simple task at the moment.</p>\\n<p>The situation
        is simply outrageous.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of over 50 signatories representing

        seek an answer to the question posed in the title, I sought out reliable data
        on open access journals. My first port of call was the <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\">Directory
        of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). Although DOAJ certainly isn&#8217;t a

        OA Diamond Journals Study</a>&#8216; (2021), it will at least help provide
        a minimum bound answer to the question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I downloaded journal-level
        data in .csv format from the DOAJ <a href=\\\"https://doaj.org/docs/public-data-dump/\\\">public
        data dump</a>. In this .csv you get data on each journal, one journal per
        line. A very crude preliminary search of the .csv file, after subsetting the
        data to exclude APC-OA journals, reveals that 947 lines of the file include
        the word &#8216;society&#8217;, albeit one of these lines is the header row.

        of course, it&#8217;s not that easy. In some cases, a journal has the word

        or -by a learned society. Lots of learned societies also don&#8217;t necessarily
        call themselves a society using that _exact_ word, in English. Unsurprisingly,
        many learned societies operate in countries that use languages other than
        English and thus the name of the society is often registered in other languages
        and even non-Latin script. To do a better job of attempting to find all the
        society-affiliated journals in DOAJ, one needs to search in a multilingual-aware
        manner. I looked at the <a href=\\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955824\\\">Wikidata

        the British Library has been affected by a significant cyberattack. Many of
        the digital services it provides have gone down and stayed down for many weeks
        now, whilst investigations take place. I have a lot of sympathy for the BL

        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Both of these services, and many others (do we even know
        how many?) are still offline at the time of writing this (2023-11-30). I can
        probably live without registering a new ISSN, that can wait. But what about
        access to my PhD thesis? I want people to be able to read this. Is it still
        available online anywhere? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis EThOS ID is: uk.bl.ethos.64202

        <br><br>Fortunately, because I retained my rights to it, my thesis is openly-licensed

        students and researchers access the content they urgently needed &#8211; because

        disclosure: for the sake of convenience, the relatively few exceptional papers
        with citations &gt;40 are not plotted. One thing that I hope you&#8217;ll
        immediately notice with all three of these citation distributions is that
        they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package &#8216;<a href=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\">e1071</a>&#8216;
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The &#8220;Non-OA&#8221; set has a skew of 8.1,

        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the

        relatively few exceptional papers with citations \\\\>40 are not plotted.
        One thing that I hope you'll immediately notice with all three of these citation
        distributions is that they are heavily skewed. With the help of the R package
        '[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html\\\"}'
        I calculated the skewness of each of these three distributions. For context
        any value larger than 1, or smaller than -1 is considered indicative of a
        strongly skewed distribution. The \\\"Non-OA\\\" set has a skew of 8.1, the
        \\\"EarlyV\\\" set has a skew of 6.0, and the \\\"Gold OA\\\" set has a skew
        of 5.4. All three citation distributions are highly skewed. This level of
        skew is absolutely to be expected. Per Seglen (1992) termed the typical skew
        of journal citation distributions \\\"[the skewness of science](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199210)43:9%3C628::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-0){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        Any decent statistician will tell you that you should not represent the central
        tendency of a highly skewed distribution with the mean and yet this is exactly
        what the authors of the SN white paper have chosen to do.\\n\\nA more statistically
        appropriate representation of three distributions is to use boxplots, inter-quartile
        ranges, and the median. Here's how that looks (the black bar indicates the
        median, which is 4 citations for \\\"Non-OA\\\" and \\\"EarlyV\\\" and is
        6 citations for \\\"Gold OA\\\"):\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-full\\\">\\n<a

        depending on exactly which journal. Comparing the citation performance of
        an article that was made immediately (day-0) open access at the journal (their
        \\\"Gold OA\\\"), with the citation performance of an article which has a

        gives the \\\"EarlyV\\\" set much less time for the purported open access

        But with the advent of the [Rights Retention Strategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/\\\"} whereby
        author manuscripts can be archived with a zero-day embargo we may eventually
        be able to do a 'fairer' analysis between the citation benefit of open access
        provided either at the journal (\\\"Gold\\\") or at a repository (\\\"Green\\\").\\n\\n3.)
        SN failed to factor-in other possible biasing factors which might be co-associated
        with \\\"Gold OA\\\" e.g. research funding. If grant funded research, from
        funders with an open access policy, tends to be more highly cited than say
        non-grant funded research, or from grant funded research from a funder that
        does not pay for open access in hybrid journals, then that would bias the
        results. What this result would really be demonstrating is funder choice for
        research that tends to be more highly cited, relative to non-grant funded
        research?\\n\\n4.) Hybrid Gold Open Access is typically priced as the most
        expensive way possible of doing open access. Whils[t the Max Planck Digital
        Library appears happy to pay Springer Nature \\\\$11,200 for some articles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02959-1\\\"}, the rest
        of the world sensibly will not pay this ransom. There also seems no cap on
        the constant above-inflation price rises of hybrid OA options over time. At
        current prices, even for 'cheaper' SN hybrid journals, most research institutions
        simply cannot afford to pay for hybrid gold open access at Springer Nature
        for all their articles. Even if it did somehow garner a tiny citation benefit
        over a three year period, is it worth \\\\$2780 per article? I think not.\\n\\n5.)
        Fully open access journals of which [there are over 17,000 listed at DOAJ](https://doaj.org/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://doaj.org/\\\"} are typically both lower in price and often
        higher in citation performance per article as I demonstrated with *SciPost
        Physics* in [Part 1 of this series](https://rossmounce.co.uk/2021/11/17/pricing-citation-impact-and-springer-nature-part-1/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        that SpringerNature have demonstrated with their white paper is alarming statistical
        illiteracy, and a lack of reproducibility and transparency. Given how popular
        measures like Clarivate's Journal Impact Factor are (which is also calculated
        in a [statistically illiterate wa](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        journal is a journal that is predominantly a paywalled subscription journal,
        albeit that it permits individual articles within that journal to not be paywalled
        if one of three things happens:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>(1) the author(s),

        Nature use the results of various analyses to claim, presumably to an audience

        infrastructure:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201CEfforts which seek to increase
        the availability of Green OA don\u2019t create the intended benefits and risk
        delaying or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the
        benefits described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions
        can help the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach
        or impact as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\u201D</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The methods by which they have chosen to

        , let alone the substantial pricing differential between the two. Simply put,
        the experimental design in the (not peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair
        or logical comparison.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Extensive
        cherry-picking</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any analysis it&#8217;s
        always good to look at the data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper
        they look at full original research papers (excluding other items found within
        journals such as Editorials, Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction
        Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries, Opinions, Research Summaries, &#8220;Other
        Journals in Brief&#8221;, &#8220;Product News&#8221; , et cetera) that are
        first published online at the journal in the calendar year 2018 (that is from
        2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive).  An interesting quirk of this is that
        lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue of SN hybrid journals
        are excluded because they tend to be published online in 2017 and only assigned
        to a &#8220;2018&#8221; issue later-on. Similarly there are many articles
        in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in &#8220;2019&#8221; journal issues
        but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. [That&#8217;s
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation&#8230;]</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When I
        first looked at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely <em><a href=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"
        data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\">Insectes
        Sociaux</a></em>, I was shocked to observe a large discrepancy between the
        number of full research articles in that journal, that were published in the
        calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number of articles from that journal
        included in SN&#8217;s whitepaper dataset (29). By my analysis the whitepaper
        arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research articles published in
        2018, in this journal. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention: </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>Only those primary research articles where
        all the necessary metadata was available<br>were included in the analysis:<br>\u2022

        a<br>journal with an impact factor<br>\u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles

        and country.</p><p><br>The overlap between these two factors left a final
        data set of 60,567 records<br>incorporated in the analysis.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Careful
        readers will observe that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the
        set of full research articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar
        year 2018. It might be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it
        is explicitly non-random &#8211; it excludes full research articles with corresponding
        authors from outside the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher
        Education (THE) rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought
        to be at least <a href=\\\"https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology\\\">31,000
        higher education institutions in the world</a>. This bakes-in a significant
        bias towards Western institutions and does not give a truly global or balanced
        picture of what&#8217;s being published in SN hybrid journals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Their
        vague description of their selection methodology doesn&#8217;t even correspond
        with the data they&#8217;ve excluded. For instance, within <em>Insectes Sociaux</em>,
        I found <a href=\\\"http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\" data-type=\\\"URL\\\"

        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is &#8220;Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan&#8221;
        , <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"

        University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to be included
        in the THE rankings</a>, therefore I can&#8217;t see why this paper is <em>not</em>
        included in their dataset of 60,567 articles.  The way in which they have
        whittled-down the sample from 157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible
        and does not appear to match their stated selection criteria. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Via
        email, I asked the authors of the report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs
        of the initial sample (just the DOIs, nothing more) and the response from
        Mithu Lucraft was<em> &#8220;I\u2019m not able to release the broader dataset.
        If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different dataset, I\u2019ll look
        into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose&#8221;</em>. I can&#8217;t
        help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available<a href=\\\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238\\\">

        of DOIs pertaining to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply
        for an NDA. <strong>SpringerNature operate transparency and open licensing
        only when it suits them</strong>. I have no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure
        agreement with SpringerNature and so I assume I will now have to recreate
        the list of ~ 157,333 full research articles published in SN hybrid journals
        in 2018, myself, without their assistance. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>A

        that the median number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when

        open access or at least public access to a version of a research output from

        hybrid journals which would you choose? On the basis of the evidence, both
        what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their report and data external
        to that, in a world where money is in limited supply, it&#8217;s clear to
        me that green open access and fully open access journals are better options.
        Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data and methods, always

        efforts (funding \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$) on their hybrid gold OA journals rather
        than green OA infrastructure:\\n\\n*\_\\\"Efforts which seek to increase the
        availability of Green OA don't create the intended benefits and risk delaying
        or even preventing the take up of full Gold OA and achieving the benefits
        described above. While sharing of subscription-tied earlier versions can help
        the dissemination of research, they do not have as strong a reach or impact
        as full Gold OA, and remain dependent on the continuation of subscription
        models to fund the costs of editorial and publishing processes to validate
        and improve the manuscript. As such, we believe investment in Gold OA should
        be a priority and is the only way to achieve full, immediate and sustainable
        OA.\\\"*\\n\\nThe methods by which they have chosen to do their analysis,
        do not accurately or cleanly tackle the hypothesis of: which intervention
        has more impact 'gold OA' or 'green OA' , let alone the substantial pricing
        differential between the two. Simply put, the experimental design in the (not
        peer reviewed) white paper is not a fair or logical comparison.\\n\\n**Extensive
        cherry-picking**\\n\\nAs with any analysis it's always good to look at the
        data sources. In the SpringerNature white paper they look at full original
        research papers (excluding other items found within journals such as Editorials,
        Letters, News, Correction Notices, Retraction Notices, Book Reviews, Obituaries,
        Opinions, Research Summaries, \\\"Other Journals in Brief\\\", \\\"Product
        News\\\" , et cetera) that are first published online at the journal in the
        calendar year 2018 (that is from 2018-01-01 to 2018-12-31 inclusive). An interesting
        quirk of this is that lots of research articles within the first 2018 issue
        of SN hybrid journals are excluded because they tend to be published online
        in 2017 and only assigned to a \\\"2018\\\" issue later-on. Similarly there
        are many articles in the SN whitepaper dataset that are in \\\"2019\\\" journal
        issues but were first published online in 2018 e.g. say December 2018. \\\\[That's
        not a complaint fwiw, just an observation...\\\\]\\n\\nWhen I first looked
        at an exemplar SN hybrid journal, namely *[Insectes Sociaux](https://www.springer.com/journal/40){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://www.springer.com/journal/40\\\"}*, I was shocked to observe
        a large discrepancy between the number of full research articles in that journal,
        that were published in the calendar year 2018 (53), and the much fewer number
        of articles from that journal included in SN's whitepaper dataset (29). By
        my analysis the whitepaper arbitrarily excludes 24 (=53-29) of the full research
        articles published in 2018, in this journal.\\n\\nThe SN whitepaper is pseudo-transparent
        about the selectivity of their sampling. On page 8 they mention:\\n\\n> Only
        those primary research articles where all the necessary metadata was available\\\\\\n>
        were included in the analysis:\\\\\\n> \u2022 138,449/157,333 (88%) of the
        articles were identified as being published in a\\\\\\n> journal with an impact
        factor\\\\\\n> \u2022 68,668/157,333 (44%) of the articles had a corresponding
        author that had an\\\\\\n> identifiable THE institutional ranking and country.\\n>\\n>
        \\\\\\n> The overlap between these two factors left a final data set of 60,567
        records\\\\\\n> incorporated in the analysis.\\n\\nCareful readers will observe
        that 60,567 out of 157,333 amounts to just 38.5% of the set of full research
        articles in SN hybrid journals, published in the calendar year 2018. It might
        be okay were this sample a random sample but clearly it is explicitly non-random
        -- it excludes full research articles with corresponding authors from outside
        the set of 2,112 institutions included in the Times Higher Education (THE)
        rankings. For context, estimates vary, but there are thought to be at least
        [31,000 higher education institutions in the world](https://www.webometrics.info/en/Methodology).
        This bakes-in a significant bias towards Western institutions and does not
        give a truly global or balanced picture of what's being published in SN hybrid
        journals.\\n\\nTheir vague description of their selection methodology doesn't
        even correspond with the data they've excluded. For instance, within *Insectes
        Sociaux*, I found [this paper](http://10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9\\\"} (DOI: 10.1007/s00040-018-0616-9)
        published in April 2018. The journal is a hybrid journal, it has a Clarivate
        Journal Impact Factor, and the corresponding author affiliation on this paper
        is \\\"Graduate School of Education, University of the Ryukyus, Japan\\\"
        , [the University of the Ryukus is one of the lucky 2,112 institutions to
        be included in the THE rankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-ryukyus\\\"},
        therefore I can't see why this paper is *not* included in their dataset of
        60,567 articles. The way in which they have whittled-down the sample from
        157,333 articles to 60,567 is not reproducible and does not appear to match
        their stated selection criteria.\\n\\nVia email, I asked the authors of the
        report for the full list of 157,333 DOIs of the initial sample (just the DOIs,
        nothing more) and the response from Mithu Lucraft was *\\\"I'm not able to
        release the broader dataset. If you wish to apply for a NDA to utilise a different
        dataset, I'll look into the appropriate contact internally for this purpose\\\"*.
        I can't help but note that the 60,567 dataset is publicly available [from
        figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Going_for_gold_exploring_the_reach_and_impact_of_Gold_open_access_articles_in_hybrid_journals_data_set_/16860238)
        under a CC BY license, yet when I ask merely for a list of DOIs pertaining
        to the very same study it is hinted I would have to apply for an NDA. **SpringerNature
        operate transparency and open licensing only when it suits them**. I have
        no intention of ever signing a non-disclosure agreement with SpringerNature
        and so I assume I will now have to recreate the list of \\\\~ 157,333 full
        research articles published in SN hybrid journals in 2018, myself, without
        their assistance.\\n\\n**A closer look at hybrid gold versus green preprints
        posted at arXiv, for physics papers**\\n\\nLeaving aside the rampant cherry-picking
        that has occurred to create the whitepaper dataset, if we drill-down into
        a subject-area e.g. 'Physics' we can observe from the dataset that the median
        number of citations of a 2018 published Physics paper, (when assessed in November
        2021, this is an elapsed period of at maximum 3 years and 10 months \\\\[if
        published 2018-01-01\\\\] and at minimum 2 years and 10 months \\\\[if published
        2018-12-31\\\\] ), in an SN hybrid journal:\\n\\n-   \\\\* that was made gold
        open access at an SN hybrid journal is **3 citations** (across n=315 articles)\\n-
        \  \\\\* that is paywalled at the hybrid SN journal but is also publicly accessible
        via an arxiv preprint copy is **3 citations** (across n=838 articles)\\n-
        \  \\\\* that is neither open access at the journal, nor publicly accessible
        via arxiv or other preprint servers or repositories is **2 citations** (for
        n=2103)\\n-   \\\\* (this data is not provided by SpringerNature, my own analysis)
        for the 111 papers published in 2018 at the fully open access journal [SciPost
        Physics](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys){data-type=\\\"URL\\\" data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys\\\"},
        which is NOT published by SpringerNature, the median number of citations is
        **10 citations**\\n\\nFrom examining the data SN provide, the citation difference
        between gold OA and green OA as routes to achieving public access to research
        is negligible.\\n\\nProviding open access or at least public access to a version
        of a research output from a theoretical perspective could clearly create more
        measurable impact (e.g. citations, downloads, altmetrics). However, [Over
        130 peer-reviewed studies have previously tested for the existence of the
        'open access citation advantage' (OACA) but a recent meta-analysis points
        out that most of them are poorly done](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253129).
        This 'Going for Gold' SN whitepaper sadly joins the majority of poorly executed
        studies.\\n\\n**What then with regard to costs?**\\n\\n-   arXiv's running
        costs famously amount to **[less than \\\\$10 per paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18351?proof=t)**.
        \\\\[I'm [conscious that this is a barebones figure that is not sustainable
        in the long-run and that arXiv sorely more financial support](https://twitter.com/undercaffeinatd/status/1219970518448779264)
        from the world's research institutions\\\\]\\n-   By 2021 list-price, SpringerNature
        physics journals, hybrid gold APCs vary from \\\\$4480 in *The Astronomy and
        Astrophysics Review* to just \\\\$2690 in *Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical
        Astronomy*, **the median list price per article to enable open access in SN
        hybrid Physics journals is \\\\$2780**\\n-   Alternatively, one could calculate
        the cost of hybrid gold on the basis of estimated per article costs contained
        within 'transformative agreement' big deals as listed at the [ESAC registry](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/).
        In the [2021 Irish IREL consortium agreement](https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry/sn2021ie/)
        with Springer Nature, Irish institutions covered by that agreement will pay
        \u20AC2,410 per article for open access, which if we convert that from Euros
        to USD is **\\\\$2727.80 per article**.\\n-   Another interesting comparator
        group left-out of the SN whitepaper is the existence of **fully open access
        journals**. The SN whitepaper chose to provide analysis exclusively of 'hybrid'
        journals. A suitable physics journal that enables open access at the journal
        for all articles is *SciPost Physics*. According to [their data](https://scipost.org/finances/apex){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://scipost.org/finances/apex\\\"}, it costs them about **620
        euros per article (\\\\~ \\\\$700 USD)**, and their model is such that there
        is no author-facing charge (no APC).\\n\\nSo, policymakers; when faced with
        a choice of enabling public access to research via 'green' routes such as
        arXiv or fully open access journals such as *SciPost Physics* or hybrid 'gold'
        routes such as SpringerNature hybrid journals which would you choose? On the
        basis of the evidence, both what SpringerNature cares to cherry-pick in their
        report and data external to that, in a world where money is in limited supply,
        it's clear to me that green open access and fully open access journals are
        better options. Hybrid journals no matter how much you cherry-pick the data
        and methods, always come out as [the most expensive](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742){data-type=\\\"URL\\\"
        data-id=\\\"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23742\\\"}
        and the most prone to price gouging practices going forwards. Spending money
        on hybrid journals is wasteful and SpringerNature's own data (!) actually
        demonstrates this.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/bsw58-9a637\",\"guid\":\"https://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2216\",\"id\":\"01a655b0-7ece-40b3-8921-b7e80a7eb133\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1637166524,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On

        Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI have read, cited, and analysed
        (textmining and image analysis) articles from both of these journals extensively.
        Chapter 6 of my [PhD thesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)
        mined over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a more
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined over 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics
        Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association) for many
        years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore very well placed
        to say that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics journals is utter
        brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles cite quite a high
        proportion of other *Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\" at
        the journal-level from Clarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an important 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.
        According to [lens.org data](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)
        Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between 2018
        and 2019. Clarivate's own records from another one of their proprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological Record](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit journals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly funded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at *International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology* (*IJSEM*) is even clearer and
        easier to explain. The [International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)
        (ICNP) ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and
        nowhere else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community should
        be commended for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology
        articles in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has
        [commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual's research output. In some regimes, if a researcher
        publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor \u2122 then
        it 'counts', whereas if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has
        not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122 by Clarivate then
        that paper may not 'count' towards the assessment of that researcher.\\n\\nThe
        [zoology section of the Chilean Society of Biology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)
        has already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I would
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, [irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and fundamentally [statistically illiterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky \\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how brainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate to please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals thereby
        removing the harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives
        of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        [APC means Article Processing Charge, a publishing service for academic customers]
        I believe this is false advertising as some of their journals clearly charge
        $5200 US dollars as an APC. $5200 is greater than the maximum of $5000 advertised.
        They also report these prices without VAT added-on, this is also misleading
