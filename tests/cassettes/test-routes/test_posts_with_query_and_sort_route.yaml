        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron
        hosting information of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally
        so libraries could collectively report and correct incorrect OA availabilty
        information.</a></p><p>It is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean
        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey
        Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March 2023.</a></p><p>Also
        in 2023, <a href=\\\"https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/Third+Iron+2023+Product+Roadmap+Recap.pdf\\\">Third
        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE

        December 2018, a University of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated
        in a workshop hosted by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition
        for Networked Information</a>. The topic of this, and a number of other events
        to date, is the drive by major scholarly publishers to more fully integrate
        authentication systems for accessing electronic media into their platforms.
        Under various labels such as \u201CResearch Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless
        Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to
        replace the authentication options previously supported by libraries and academic
        institutions, such as IP range activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous
        authentication to neutral third parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in
        favor of their own initiatives.[1] For years, librarians have countered these
        moves with their concerns that it will undermine the privacy of their users.
        Even at the event where Cody Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly noting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information
        (PII) to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a single sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that
        the technical realization is different. But then, to calm the discussion,
        Carpenter added, \u201Cthat publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be
        able to identify library users.\u201D And that statement, of course, was absolutely
        designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody Hanson, who spent a
        lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic media for his
        users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis of the source
        code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and how publishers
        can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took
        the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked at them to see
        which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document from each
        of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,
        and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several thousand
        lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes, it\u2019s
        true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms examined,
        one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total of 139 different
        third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical assortment was represented:
        simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle,
        and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds were significant to Cody
        Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was interested in third-party
        assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript loaded on these
        pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model, meaning it can
        read the address and contents of the page. It also has access to every user
        action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional scripts from
        additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript from
        Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page about
        the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the publisher
        platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google code
        on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure><img

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><img

        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign

        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other

        from Clarivate\u2019s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important \u2018megajournal\u2019 for the zoological systematics community.

        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual\u2019s research output. In some regimes, if a
        researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it \u2018counts\u2019, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper

        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics&#8217;. The study used a review

        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in &#8216;developing&#8217; regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that &#8216;predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries&#8217; (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of &#8216;predatory&#8217;
        on Cabell&#8217;s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as &#8216;potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics&#8217; (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a &#8216;simple binary phenomenon&#8217; and
        that some classified journals may exist in a &#8216;grey zone&#8217; between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn&#8217;t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors&#8217; strategy is
        that their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell&#8217;s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various &#8216;sting&#8217;
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell&#8217;s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not in any
        way questioning the author&#8217;s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is &#8216;predatory&#8217;. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that &#8212; consciously or not &#8212; separate them from the

        Watch was launched to provide insights into cases of scientific fraud and
        grant a window on the retraction process. How does the scientific community
        react when you publicly report on retractions of scientific papers? How should
        retractions be received by the scientific community?</strong></p>\\n<p><span>While
        there are some scientists who are concerned that publicizing retractions \u2014
        \u201Cairing science\u2019s dirty laundry,\u201D so to speak \u2014 could
        give ammunition to those who want to defund research, most are very supportive.
        They realize that the best way to build trust is to acknowledge that errors
        and misconduct exist, and to show the world how science corrects itself. In
        other words, the growth in retractions </span><a href=\\\"https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/two-cheers-for-the-retraction-boom\\\"><span>is
        a good thing</span></a><span>.</span></p>\\n<p><span>There\u2019s even evidence
        that scientists who \u201Cdo the right thing\u201D </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/\\\"><span>won\u2019t
        see a decline in their career prospects</span></a><span>. But that depends
        on retraction notices that provide the entire story: It\u2019s only true when
        those notices make it clear there wasn\u2019t fraud or misconduct involved.
        We\u2019ve of course argued for detailed notices since we launched Retraction
        Watch.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>How have digital platforms and tools changed
        the way erroneous results are uncovered/discovered? How have they enabled
        Retraction Watch?</strong></p>\\n<p><span>The simple fact that the vast majority
        of scholarly papers are online today means that more people can read \u2014
        and scrutinize \u2014 them. Using a program like Photoshop, a scientist or
        layperson can reverse engineer the manipulation that created a problematic
        image. As I write this, a team has just </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02421-3\\\"><span>announced</span></a><span>
        a way to find duplicated images that authors claim represent different results,
        but clearly can\u2019t. And plagiarism detection software is of course a good
        tool to screen for plagiarism and duplication \u2014 aka \u201Cself-plagiarism\u201D
        \u2014 of text.</span></p>\\n<p><span>What has really moved the field forward,
        however, are platforms such as PubPeer, an \u201Conline journal club\u201D
        where scientists share critiques of papers. A number of corrections and retractions
        have </span><a href=\\\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pubpeer-biotech-investors/\\\"><span>flowed
        from those discussions</span></a><span>. (PubMed Commons was another such
        tool, although discussions were not as critical, and the National Library
        of Medicine </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/02/pubmed-shuts-comments-feature-pubmed-commons/\\\"><span>recently
        decided to shut it down</span></a><span>.) Moving forward, the growth of preprints
        in biology and related fields could allow detection of errors before papers
        are even officially peer-reviewed.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Solely by control
        or active watching the problem of intransparency of the retraction process
        cannot be solved. In this context, research ethics matter a lot. How could
        \_better research ethics evolve?</strong></p>\\n<p><span>I would argue that
        sustained attention to the retraction process has already led to some changes.
        Take the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC), for example. For the first
        five years of Retraction Watch, the JBC\u2019s retraction notices were bereft
        of content, noting simply that the article in question had been retracted
        at the request of the authors or the editors. In 2015, </span><a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/25/now-this-is-good-news-in-policy-change-jbc-will-now-make-retraction-notices-informative/\\\"><span>that
        changed</span></a><span>, and today the JBC is one of the most aggressive
        journals when it comes to policing the papers it publishers.</span></p>\\n<p><span>In
        a larger sense, however, it\u2019s true that preventing all misconduct is
        impossible, just as expecting to prevent all theft or violence is a fool\u2019s
        errand. Just as for crimes, the best approach is one that combines prevention,
        detection, deterrence, and rewards for the kind of behavior we want to promote.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>In
        your opinion: What should academia change in the way it publishes and reviews
        results? What role should academic and professional education play?</strong></p>\\n<p><span>As
        others have noted, the \u201C</span><a href=\\\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand/\\\"><span>winner
        takes all</span></a><span>\u201D approach to credit in science \u2014 and
        therefore to doling out grants and jobs \u2014 has created enormous pressure
        and forces researchers to publish in only a handful of \u201Cprestigious\u201D
        journals. That means everyone is always striving for perfect and earth-shattering
        results, and that there is little incentive to repeat experiments or admit
        error.</span></p>\\n<p><span>It sounds simplistic and perhaps even naive,
        but we all need to remember how to read papers, instead of judging them by
        metrics. That\u2019s where initiatives such as DORA \u2014 the </span><a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01642-w\\\"><span>Declaration

        Data: A novel on Life in Science</strong> by <strong>Pernille R\xF8rth</strong>
        (Springer, 2016)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://quantixed.org/2016/03/31/my-blank-pages-v-raw-data/41txjjrwibl-_sx328_bo1204203200_/\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        was keen to read this \u201Clab lit\u201D novel written by renowned cell biologist
        Pernille R\xF8rth.\_I\u2019d seen\_lots of enthusiastic comments about the
        book, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.</p>\\n<p>I was frustrated to read two
        pieces about <em>Raw Data</em>\_on <a href=\\\"http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/04/when-misconduct-strikes-a-fictional-tale/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a> and <a href=\\\"http://thenode.biologists.com/raw-data-cautionary-tale/bookreviews/\\\">The
        Node</a>, both of which gave the plot away with no warning, so if you haven\u2019t
        read it and want to enjoy the suspense while you read, look away now.</p>\\n<p>The
        story\_is set in a high flying cancer cell biology lab in Boston. Postdocs
        are working night and day to try and land a paper in <em>Nature</em> and to
        become an independent PI. Chloe manages it, while Karen is struggling, despite
        her best efforts. Karen accidentally uncovers that Chloe may have cut some
        corners to get her paper into <em>Nature</em> and this sets off a cascade
        of events, leading to the retraction of the paper. It\u2019s a fascinating
        tale, well-written and completely absorbing. I recommend\_it for anyone working
        in science. You will smile at the references to conference coffee, failed
        scientists and more.</p>\\n<p>The plotline is highly reminiscent of <em>Intuition</em>
        by Allegra Goodman, even down to the tumours growing in the mice. Both stories
        echo the real-life events of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari\\\">Thereza
        Imanishi-Kari</a> which are detailed in the overlong but comprehensive <em>The
        Baltimore Case</em> by Daniel J. Kevles. R\xF8rth\u2019s retelling of the
        science world is more convincing that Goodman\u2019s, due in part to her 25
        years as a scientist. Nonetheless,\_<em>Intuition</em> is a great book that
        I\u2019d also recommend in this genre.</p>\\n<p><em>Raw Data</em>\_is thought-provoking.
        You can ponder the role of Tom, the PI who has cultivated a certain atmosphere
        in the lab. What about the pressure to publish? How about the\_peer reviewers
        who dangle the carrot of \u201Cget this result and you can have a Nature paper\u201D
        in front of Chloe? It\u2019s a toxic mix and it\u2019s happening in labs all
        over the world. A terrifying thought.</p>\\n<p>On the role of Tom: one thing
        that is slightly underexplored is the fact that Tom tells Chloe that there
        is a competing group that could \u2018scoop\u2019 her while she is rushing
        to finish her paper. It isn\u2019t clear whether this group actually\_exists
        and if this was a tactic to gee her along. Either way it is another bit\_of
        pressure which goes on to\_create the misconduct.</p>\\n<p>Not so long ago
        a high profile research institute in the UK announced that it was recruiting
        PIs by looking\_for the \u201Cbest scientific athlete\u201D. I read last week
        that so far from the London 2012 Olympics, 37 track-and-field sportspeople
        have had their results disqualified\_by the IAAF for doping. The parallels
        are interesting. Science, like sport, is run with\_winner-takes-all rules
        and the high stakes and pressure that go along with it. The incentives are
        dangerous and I wonder what we are creating with this atmosphere. Certainly,
        as PIs we have a real responsibility, just as coaches do in sport, to ensure
        our trainees make the right choices in their career.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve seen
        nothing but recommendations for this book so far and mine is another one.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s
        Matthew Freeman\_saying\_that it would be required reading for everyone in
