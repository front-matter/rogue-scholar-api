        and some other conditions (here written in English and published after 2010).
        I thought a good search term to try out the concept would be <strong>Retraction

        notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish the first overlay
        blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting approach to automate
        the generating of overlay blog posts, open to everyone as the content of the
        Rogue Scholar API is freely available for reuse. I particularly like using
        both automation and manual curation using open source tools, which is a powerful

        big news is that [Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions
        of concerns and retractions and has made it openly accessible to anyone who
        wants to use it](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I'm waiting for full
        confirmation of the license or public domain dedication under which it will
        be released, but this is still a great commitment of Crossref to the POSI
        principles. The liberation of this database is good for science and scholarship
        in general. It means that Crossref now knows about approximately 50,000 retractions.\\n\\nAccess
        to the database, for now, is via the Crossref Labs API, which I write and
        maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits in between the user and the Live API
        to inject new experimental metadata fields. The API can also serve files,
        so you can get the CSV of the latest Retraction Watch data at https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].\\n\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the cr-labs-updates entry if
        you visit a work that has data, e.g. https://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].\\n\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that [was asked within an hour of our launch](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is: how can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what
        we call a \\\"filter\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult
        to do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it's so difficult is because the
        Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about
        retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries
        that have retractions means building a separate index of all items with retractions,
        then fetching these, and paging through them with the user's requests. This
        gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load,
        and I don't recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to
        no avail. So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full
        list of retractions. We'll continue to work on an API solution, but it's going
        to take us a bit longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime, publishers: please continue
        to deposit retractions. It's really important and we need to end the culture
        of _shame_ (at least for publishers) around declaring retractions. It is vital
        for the progress of science that we accurately mark papers that have been
        shown to be defective.\\n\\nThe other important thing to note about all this
        is that, with any luck, it will help to make Retraction Watch itself sustainable.

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        information.</a></p><p>It is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean
        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat
        your institution has? According [to this\\narticle](https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212),\\n\\\\\\\"the
        access to subscribed content only works for libraries using\\nEBSCO\\\\'s
        Holdings Management tool\\\\\\\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKYUa5duJstn5DRBN-5SaTkx9buVgIAtWTYQrK3ofT-oQoSYWNS7mO-jDtGzPiG5BykdVA7hHLou9W_mhTxJAvlObm7o8Rig4_LUgaNh1rdqaocd4WBabUwzVX3QCxVxOHScwSyihn3AnYNNcRYV2jIRRxSeVYUPwJWD7kizKSfEQIqjh3aCJwmpw3EErV/w640-h286/ebscopassport4.png){border=\\\"0\\\"\\noriginal-height=\\\"234\\\"

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to

        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"

        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a

        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect

        first post on this blog was published on August 3, 2007 (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1q\\\">Open
        access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</a>). This is post number
        465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and
        hosting location \u2013 but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few
        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom
        and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing that meat, fish, and cheese
        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this
        blog. And since 2012, when I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university

        This is post\\nnumber 465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes
        in\\ntechnology and hosting location -- but I wrote all posts (with the\\nexception
        of a few guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged:\\ntechnology
        used in scholarly communication.\\n\\nInstead of a detailed analysis of recurring
        themes, or how scholarly\\ncommunication has changed in the last 15 years,
        I want to pick one topic\\nthat continues to worry me, and has been the subject
        of multiple posts\\non this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as
        publishing\\nformat for scholarly articles.\\n\\nThis week I read two interesting
        articles related to climate change. One\\nof them ([Over half of known human
        pathogenic diseases can be aggravated\\nby climate change](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1))
        did an\\nimpressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of
        ten\\nclimatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known\\nhuman
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper\\n([Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food\\nproducts](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119))
        tried to estimate\\nthe environmental impact of more than 50K food products
        in the United\\nKingdom and Ireland (no big surprises, but again stressing
        that meat,\\nfish, and cheese have a significant environmental impact).\\n\\nBoth
        articles are available online as full-text, but they come in PDF\\nformat.
        Fine for printing and then reading them (which I did), but in\\n2022 I expect
        to read papers on a tablet (which I use for almost all my\\nreading) where
        the PDF letter or A4 size doesn\\\\'t quite fit on the\\n10-inch screen. There
        are other problems with PDF (e.g. access to\\nmetadata such as references
        and using PDF as submission format, e.g.\\nwith preprints). These problems
        are not new and there are workarounds,\\nbut in the 15 years of writing this
        blog -- despite a lot of progress --\\nscholarly communication continues to
        have an uneasy relationship with\\ntechnology and is often stuck in the past.
        In contrast to many (but of\\ncourse not all) other sectors.\\n\\nThis means
        there are many reasons to continue writing this blog. And\\nsince 2012, when
        I gave up my job as a medical doctor in a university\\nhospital, I am working

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div
        class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gF6hWhzNB3Se9ktkzfDeyUxTJ1vCOeLcdfhT3b1vSZmk4zOoBtUf1DUsuWW2-glKiJ4apciOnHH1zhMMSgKXtM_HFfczZtb8_vGwfRbqyltjYK-ACO-bRvgCpVX8q-bUAguQVtgk\\\"

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        Siems</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn December 2018, a University of
        Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson,\\nparticipated in a workshop hosted
        by the [Coalition for Networked\\nInformation](https://www.cni.org/). The
        topic of this, and a number of\\nother events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more\\nfully integrate authentication systems for
        accessing electronic media\\ninto their platforms. Under various labels such
        as \\\"Research Access 21\\n(RA21)\\\", \\\"Seamless Access\\\", or \\\"Get
        Full Text Research (GetFTR)\\\", they\\nwant to replace the authentication
        options previously supported by\\nlibraries and academic institutions, such
        as IP range activation, VPN,\\nproxy servers, or anonymous authentication
        to neutral third parties, as\\nwith the Shibboleth service, in favor of their
        own initiatives.\\\\[1\\\\] For\\nyears, librarians have countered these moves
        with their concerns that it\\nwill undermine the privacy of their users. Even
        at the event where Cody\\nHanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National\\nInformation Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly\\nnoting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information\\n(PII)
        to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact,\\nservices
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a\\nsingle sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) -- it's\\njust that the
        technical realization is different. But then, to calm the\\ndiscussion, Carpenter
        added, \\\"that publishers don't need PII from RA21\\nto be able to identify
        library users.\\\" And that statement, of course,\\nwas absolutely designed
        to allay any concerns.\\n\\nCody Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing
        privacy-compliant access\\nto electronic media for his users, began to wonder.
        Should this be true\\nand can an analysis of the source code of publisher
        platform pages\\nprovide evidence of if and how publishers can identify library
        users?\\nCody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded\\ndocuments
        at his university and looked at them to see which platforms\\nwere represented
        in them. He picked one document from each of the\\nfifteen platforms found,
        examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,\\nand downloaded the document
        page to examine the source code. Several\\nthousand lines of JavaScript later,
        Cody Hanson came to a simple answer:\\nyes, it's true, Carpenter was right.\\n\\nOf
        the fifteen platforms examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on\\nthe
        others, he found a total of 139 different third-party asset sources.\\nAdTech's
        entire technical assortment was represented: simple trackers,\\naudience tools
        like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and\\nfingerprinters like Doubleclick.
        These finds were significant to Cody\\nHanson:\\n\\n\\\"The reason I was interested
        in third-party assets being loaded on these\\nsites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the\\nentire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address\\nand contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that\\nhappens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from\\nadditional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts
        JavaScript\\nfrom Google on its pages, Google can record any information from
        the\\npage about the article being sought, or search terms from a library
        user\\nin the publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms\\nincluded
        Google code on the article page.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nFacebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of\\nother data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a\\ngiven. Personalized profiles of
        the information behavior of every\\nscientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large\\nInternet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors,\\nthe data does not remain with the publishers, but flows
        out and can be\\nlinked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about
        the\\nperson. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of\\nevery
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science\\ncommunication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and\\ngovernmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.\\n\\n## Researchers at risk\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        are the consequences of this? First, it must be noted that this is\\na violation
        of fundamental rights: liberal societies have freedom of\\nresearch and teaching
        enshrined in their constitutions, but a monitored\\nfreedom is not. Thus,
        academic freedom as we knew it has come to its\\nend. But this is not merely
        an abstract shortcoming, because tracking\\ncan put scientists at concrete
        and grave risk. After all, in recent\\nyears we have seen that, as a researcher,
        you can get into trouble even\\nin countries where you would not have suspected
        it in the past: in one\\ncountry you don't make friends with research on climate
        change,\\\\[3\\\\] in\\nanother not with gender studies.\\\\[4\\\\] And in
        Hungary, the Central\\nEuropean University was chased out of the country.\\\\[5\\\\]
        Putting pressure\\non scientists is, of course, much easier when you know
        more about them,\\nand since their behavioral profiles are tradable, they
        are of course\\nopen to all interested actors, as long as they want to spend
        the\\nnecessary money.\\n\\nEconomic consequences are also foreseeable, be
        it either in the form of\\na distortion of competition to the detriment of
        publishers who act in a\\ntrustworthy manner and therefore do not track, or,
        above all, in the\\ndestruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future\\nfields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there\\nis strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby\\nthe
        commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and\\ndisseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata\\nmakes itself
        felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication\\nsurveillance: if you know
        who contacted each other, when, how often, and\\nin what sequence, you don't
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore,\\nit's all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being\\ntracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know\\nwhat they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And\\nsince it's not just one researcher who
        is being tracked and all the data\\ncan be analyzed together in business intelligence
        -- who will be faster\\nin filing a patent application? And will research
        results still benefit\\nthe public that paid for them?\\n\\nSo is it time
        to update the old joke \\\"Come to the dark side, we have\\ncookies\\\"? Absolutely.
        And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are\\ngoing to put a stop to
        third-party tracking, can we sit back because it\\nwill all have been an ugly
        transitional phase? Not at all. All the\\ninterested players are either busy
        monopolizing data access for\\nthemselves, like Google, or continuing to find
        ways for themselves, like\\nothers. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are\\nyou'll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your\\ninformation behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to\\nset a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.\\\\[6\\\\]\\nElsevier,
        as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the\\ngroup's Risk
        Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its\\nScienceDirect platform,
        a technology that boasts of being able to\\nindividually identify billions
        of devices and, if you recall the\\ndiscussion about ebay, does not shy away
        from port scanning.\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        the ScienceDirect-platform\_\\n\\nThe argument about authentication is also
        far from over\\\\[8\\\\], and\\npublishers sometimes use sleazy methods to
        enforce their wishes. In\\n2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out
        deadlines for switching\\nto seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown,
        and those who\\ndidn't keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to\\nnew access rules.\\\\[9\\\\] Using the same instrument over the
        Christmas\\nholidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation\\nof
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows\\ninformation
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The\\ngoal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because\\nthis is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are\\nhardly accepted there;
        currently Elsevier and SpringerNature are\\nconsidering infiltrating Trojans
        into university networks via the\\nlibraries in order to be able to collect
        biometric data such as typing\\nspeed or types of mouse movement in order
        to be able to identify users\\nin other areas of the Internet as well.\\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\nSo
        what is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they\\nwant
        to expand their unassailable position in information access to the\\nentire
        research life cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those\\nconcluded
        by Elsevier in the Netherlands, under which researchers can\\npublish open
        access at no extra cost if the universities license\\nElsevier products in
        the area of research information systems in\\nreturn.\\\\[11\\\\] Such contracts
        are disastrous, because it will be\\nimmediately clear to all researchers
        that their research will only be\\nproperly noted in the next evaluation if
        it also ends up in the\\nappropriate journals. Consequently, the market for
        both publication and\\nresearch information systems will quickly clear up
        as a result of this\\nlinkage business, and then the platform will have moved
        a step closer to\\nits goal again: namely, that it is not science, universities
        or research\\nfunders who determine which research is the \\\"right\\\" one
        and how much it\\n\\\"counts\\\"\\\\[12\\\\] but rather the platform who makes
        the determination.\\n\\nSuch deals seem like revenants from the nineties,
        when, in the [browser\\nwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
        Microsoft knocked\\nNetscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows.\\nAnother revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if
        libraries\\nhad dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing\\npublishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making\\nself archiving
        worthless by signing up for package licenses\\\\[13\\\\] (which\\nis why the
        head of SpringerNature called package licenses \\\"the best\\ninvention since
        sliced bread\\\"\\\\[14\\\\]), now they are once again holding\\nout for publishers,
        where publishers are having their Napster moment\\nthrough SciHub. By partnering
        with publishers to commercialize open\\naccess through publication fees, libraries
        are trying to crisis-proof\\ntheir business: as long as science governance
        doesn't change, scientists\\nwill have to publish in the appropriate journals,
        and libraries will\\nprevail precisely in the area of accounting and managing
        publication\\ncosts so they can continue to justify their staff and budgets.
        As a\\nresult, publication fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in\\nsome
        cases\\\\[15\\\\] -- so there is always enough money with the publishers\\nto
        continue to outspend, out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any\\nalternatives
        that are developed from within the scientific community.\\nAnd, moreover,
        DEAL contracts in Germany are already beginning to\\ndistort competition from
        publishers in favor of the big players on whom\\nthe negotiations are focused
        -- adding even more more money to even\\nfewer players.\\\\[16\\\\]\\n\\n##

        scholarly communication, this is no longer\\nenough. Thomson Reuters and RELX
        have discovered the global security\\nindustry as a buyer of their data analytics
        products, and have signed\\nbig data policing contracts with law enforcement
        organizations like\_\\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that
        use these tools to\\ntrack immigrants.\\\\[17\\\\] Since both publishers are
        central providers of\\nspecialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the\\nmoment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or\\nLexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby\\ncontributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.\\\\[18\\\\] The\\npublishers,
        of course, dismiss it all -- and at the same time continue\\nto escalate the
        path taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir,\\nand so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and\\nanalyzed in Palantir's analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and\\ntools are sold globally just as the
        data they feed is collected\\nglobally, illegal immigrants don't have to be
        the only ones they're used\\nagainst -- the respective interested parties
        can surely think of\\nsomething -- and library money is supporting these systems
        of\\nsurveillance.\\\\[19\\\\] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state\\nand
        commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get\\nwhatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any\\nlonger on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search\\nwarrant. The motto of
        a data broker applies, who, when asked who was\\nactually exchanging data
        with whom, replied: \\\"Everyone with everyone.\\nIt's one\\\\[2\\\\]\_ big
        whorehouse.\\\"\\\\[20\\\\]\\n\\nSo where do we stand? We have seen in the
        past that, due to the special\\nsituation of the Cold War, the major scientific
        publishers grew into an\\nearly form of platform economy, long before the
        large Internet\\ncorporations adapted this principle and were thus able to
        achieve their\\ncurrent position.\\\\[21\\\\] With their work on the Trojans,
        the publishers\\nare also revealing geopolitical interests, namely to cut
        off entire\\nstates from the flow of scientific information, and are thus
        part of a\\nCold War 4.0.\\\\[22\\\\] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with\\nscientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also
        had to\\nrecognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their
        actual\\npurpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has
        been\\nanalyzed time and again in the past\\\\[23\\\\], but only now, through
        the\\nreplication crisis and every glance at [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/),
        is it becoming clear how the\\ncompulsion for storytelling, the fudging of
        data, and the fight for the\\nsmallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from\\nwithin. Leading players in science communication
        will have no problem\\nwith this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen
        journals in the past\\nthat claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells
        rented out to\\npharmaceutical companies to be filled.\\\\[24\\\\] And the
        parent company RELX\\nengages in political landscaping with donations to climate
        change\\ndeniers and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.\\\\[25\\\\]\\nAll
        this can only happen almost without contradiction because\\ninfrastructure
        is still a largely blind spot in science governance. More\\nand more voices
        are calling for an \\\"infrastructural turn\\\",\\\\[26\\\\] but\\neven in
        the welcome European initiatives the old mistakes are being\\nmade, because
        in the European Open Science Cloud Elsevier has\\nnested\\\\[27\\\\] just
        as ORE is run by F1000 Research -- which has been\\nbought up by Taylor &
        Francis.\\\\[28\\\\]\\n\\nSo parts of the scientific information infrastructures
        are increasingly\\nmoving toward the dark money complex, as characterized
        by the Koch\\nbrothers, or even by Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge\\nAnalytica
        possible. If you read Christopher Wylie's report on this\\\\[29\\\\]\\nand
        compare it with Shoshana Zuboff's analysis of surveillance\\ncapitalism\\\\[30\\\\],
        you will see that science and antiscience\\\\[31\\\\] are\\nincreasingly amalgamating
        into a confusing tangle, because in the same\\nway that this system could
        not be operated at all without a developed\\nscientific education, it is at
        the same time laying the axe to the\\nfoundations of truth, enlightenment
        and social liberties. In discourse,\\nthis becomes clear in the meteoric rise
        of half-truths, which are used\\nby conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic
        players, as well as the\\nmedia -- and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg
        Peters recently\\ndeveloped this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie's \\\"Science
        Fictions\\\"\\nas a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards\\nunreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront
        of\\nattention.\\\\[32\\\\] Not from the perspective of an economist, but
        of a\\nliterary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that\\nno
        longer operates according to the scheme true/false, but according to\\nschemes
        such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and\\nconnective/closed. What
        is central, she says, is internal coherence and\\nno longer correspondence
        with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,\\ncould no longer be resolved
        with a fact check, but only with a fiction\\ncheck, which highlights how the
        half-truth builds a narrative around a\\ncrystallization core of truth while
        pretending to report facts.\\\\[33\\\\] We\\nfind much of this in the corrupted
        information infrastructures, such as\\nthe impossibility for the reviewer
        to follow documents of a 21st century\\ndata-driven science to the ground
        of fact within a 17th century\\npublication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on\\ncredibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently\\nexposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same
        justification\\nphrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist
        Claas\\nRelotius.\\\\[34\\\\]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter all -- when we
        talk about power and power abuse in academia, the\\ninformation infrastructures
        must not be forgotten. They are in your lab,\\nthey are in your life, they're
        corrupting the truth, they're selling\\nyour ass and there is little you can
        do about it.\\\\[35\\\\] Nevertheless, it\\nremains the responsibility of
        each individual to reflect on this for\\ntheir actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal\\nYarkoni states in his great rant:\\n\\n>
        \\\"When people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and\\n>
        The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It's\\n> very
        hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone\\n> believes
        (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way\\n> to get by.\\\"\\\\[36\\\\]\\n\\nGaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins.\\nActing
        responsibly, on the other hand, means supporting and improving\\nexisting
        European initiatives. In Germany, this is currently being done,\\namong other
        things, through the National Research Data Infrastructure\\n(NFDI), which
        is cooperative and public. This path must be expanded, and\\nthe mistakes
        from the literature supply must be avoided at all costs.\\nScience will never
        be happy again as long as the big players remain in\\nthe game. The success
        of the NFDI is all the more crucial because in the\\ndata-driven sciences,
        data, software and text belong in a common context\\nso that results can be
        verified and immediately developed further. For\\nscientists, the current
        situation is like when a programmer first writes\\nhis code, then publishes
        an article about it, and the next programmer\\ntries to guess the code from
        the article and then creates an improved\\nversion. Sounds highly efficient?
        And that's exactly why GitHub exists\\n-- and a trusted, powerful and non-buyable
        version of it would be\\nexactly what science needs.\\\\[37\\\\]\\n\\nAnd
        before I forget -- there is one more thing you can easily do: join\\nthe community
        of scientists who don't want everything done to them and\\nsign the [Stop

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        paper [is\\nretracted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9).\\n\\nThat's
        a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper. And it raises a\\nlot of
        questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:\\n\\n> We, the authors, are
        retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate\\n> information from remaining
        in the literature. Although the description\\n> of *Oculudentavis khaungraae*
        remains accurate, a new unpublished\\n> specimen casts doubts upon our hypothesis
        regarding the phylogenetic\\n> position of HPG-15-3.\\n\\nBut we constantly
        see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are\\noverturned by new specimens.
        We usually deal with this by writing a new\\npaper. Why, in this case, is
        there a retraction? Something smells wrong\\nhere.\\n\\nAnd the plot thickens
        in [Retraction Watch's\\naccount](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/):\\ncorresponding
        author Jingmai O'Connor told them:\\n\\n> I don't agree with the retraction
        but there is no point in fighting\\n> it, so we all signed it.\\n>\\n> I cannot
        say why *Nature* chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on\\n> their inner
        machinations. \\\\[...\\\\] It is also not that unusual for\\n> paleontologists
        to misidentify things and for new information to\\n> correct previous hypotheses.
        However, *Nature* chose not to publish\\n> the Matter's Arising and instead
        retracts our paper -- they must have\\n> their reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the\\n*authors* retracted
        the original paper --- yet the corresponding author\\nsays that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors' will.\\n\\nI don't know what's going
        on here. I agree with O'Connor that \\\"It's\\nunfortunate because this way
        science can't simply correct itself (as it\\nis supposed to do)\\\". If, as
        Li et al. (2000) argue, *Oculudentavis* is\\nactually a squamate (lizard),
        well, fine: they can publish their\\nconclusion, and the community will arrive
        at a consensus as to which\\nidentification is correct. That's how it works,
        right? So why the\\nretraction?\\n\\nAnd there's more: what does this mean
        for zoological nomenclature? Is\\nthe name *Oculudentavis khaungraae* still
        nomenclaturally valid?\\nOpinions on this seem to vary (see [the Dinosaur
        Mailing List thread\\nbeginning with Ben Creisler's announcement of the\\nretraction](http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156).)\\n\\nI
        lean to the interpretation that, since the [International Code on\\nZoological\\nNomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/)\\ndoes
        not mention retractions, it implicitly takes the position that a\\npaper once
        published is published forever. On that basis, the name\\n*Oculudentavis*
        remains valid and attached to the holoype specimen ---\\neven if that name,
        with its *-avis* suffix, proves to have been poorly\\nchosen in pertaining
        to a non-bird. (After all, there is plenty of\\nprecedent for misleading names
        staying in place: the whale\\n*Basilosaurus* is not a saurian, and the clade
        of \\\"false crocodiles\\\"\\nPseudosuchia includes the true crocodiles.)\\n\\nThis
        doesn't seem to be what Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook\\nexchange forwarded
        to me by a friend who I will leave anonymous unless\\nhe or she chooses to
        out him or herself, Henry Gee comments \\\"The\\nretraction means the paper
        is erased from the record, and this includes\\nthe name\\\".\\n\\n[![](https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png){.alignnone\\n.size-full

        think this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments\\nfrom

        help but suspect that something is going on here\\nthat's not being clearly

        due to the human rights record of\\nthe Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors\\nof the original *Oculudentavis* colluded
        in describing it as a bird when\\nthey knew it was something else? I don't
        know (and to be 100% clear, I\\nam *not* accusing anyone of anything). But
        I do know that *Nature*'s\\nvague and possibly misleading retraction notice
        is not helping, and is\\nnot in the spirit of transparency that we aim to

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On

        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer

        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        **overlay blog post** applies the idea of an **overlay journal** to\\nscience

        has an open license\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\n--
        makes that easy.\\n\\nThe Jupyter notebook that I started and [made available

        all blog posts using a search term and some other conditions\\n(here written
        in English and published after 2010). I thought a good\\nsearch term to try
        out the concept would be **Retraction Watch**, after\\nthe [announcement in\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        that\\n*Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions
        of\\nconcerns and retractions and has made it openly accessible to anyone

        query for that search term returned 17 blog posts included in Rogue\\nScholar

        Conclusions\\n\\nThe notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish
        the\\nfirst overlay blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting\\napproach
        to automate the generating of overlay blog posts, open to\\neveryone as the
        content of the Rogue Scholar API is freely available for\\nreuse. I particularly
        like using both automation and manual curation\\nusing open source tools,
        which is a powerful combination\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner, M. (2023).

        big news is that [Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions

        wants to use it](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I'm waiting for full
        confirmation of the license or public domain dedication under which it will
        be released, but this is still a great commitment of Crossref to the POSI
        principles. The liberation of this database is good for science and scholarship
        in general. It means that Crossref now knows about approximately 50,000 retractions.\\n\\nAccess
        to the database, for now, is via the Crossref Labs API, which I write and
        maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits in between the user and the Live API
        to inject new experimental metadata fields. The API can also serve files,
        so you can get the CSV of the latest Retraction Watch data at https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].\\n\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the cr-labs-updates entry if

        obvious question (and one that [was asked within an hour of our launch](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is: how can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what
        we call a \\\"filter\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult
        to do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it's so difficult is because the
        Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about
        retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries
        that have retractions means building a separate index of all items with retractions,
        then fetching these, and paging through them with the user's requests. This
        gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load,
        and I don't recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to
        no avail. So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full
        list of retractions. We'll continue to work on an API solution, but it's going
        to take us a bit longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime, publishers: please continue
        to deposit retractions. It's really important and we need to end the culture
        of _shame_ (at least for publishers) around declaring retractions. It is vital
        for the progress of science that we accurately mark papers that have been
        shown to be defective.\\n\\nThe other important thing to note about all this
        is that, with any luck, it will help to make Retraction Watch itself sustainable.

        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to

        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"

        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        Siems</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn December 2018, a University of
        Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson,\\nparticipated in a workshop hosted
        by the [Coalition for Networked\\nInformation](https://www.cni.org/). The
        topic of this, and a number of\\nother events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more\\nfully integrate authentication systems for
        accessing electronic media\\ninto their platforms. Under various labels such
        as \\\"Research Access 21\\n(RA21)\\\", \\\"Seamless Access\\\", or \\\"Get
        Full Text Research (GetFTR)\\\", they\\nwant to replace the authentication
        options previously supported by\\nlibraries and academic institutions, such
        as IP range activation, VPN,\\nproxy servers, or anonymous authentication
        to neutral third parties, as\\nwith the Shibboleth service, in favor of their
        own initiatives.\\\\[1\\\\] For\\nyears, librarians have countered these moves
        with their concerns that it\\nwill undermine the privacy of their users. Even
        at the event where Cody\\nHanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National\\nInformation Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly\\nnoting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information\\n(PII)
        to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact,\\nservices
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a\\nsingle sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) -- it's\\njust that the
        technical realization is different. But then, to calm the\\ndiscussion, Carpenter
        added, \\\"that publishers don't need PII from RA21\\nto be able to identify
        library users.\\\" And that statement, of course,\\nwas absolutely designed
        to allay any concerns.\\n\\nCody Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing
        privacy-compliant access\\nto electronic media for his users, began to wonder.
        Should this be true\\nand can an analysis of the source code of publisher
        platform pages\\nprovide evidence of if and how publishers can identify library
        users?\\nCody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded\\ndocuments
        at his university and looked at them to see which platforms\\nwere represented
        in them. He picked one document from each of the\\nfifteen platforms found,
        examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,\\nand downloaded the document
        page to examine the source code. Several\\nthousand lines of JavaScript later,
        Cody Hanson came to a simple answer:\\nyes, it's true, Carpenter was right.\\n\\nOf
        the fifteen platforms examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on\\nthe
        others, he found a total of 139 different third-party asset sources.\\nAdTech's
        entire technical assortment was represented: simple trackers,\\naudience tools
        like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and\\nfingerprinters like Doubleclick.
        These finds were significant to Cody\\nHanson:\\n\\n\\\"The reason I was interested
        in third-party assets being loaded on these\\nsites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the\\nentire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address\\nand contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that\\nhappens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from\\nadditional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts
        JavaScript\\nfrom Google on its pages, Google can record any information from
        the\\npage about the article being sought, or search terms from a library
        user\\nin the publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms\\nincluded
        Google code on the article page.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nFacebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of\\nother data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a\\ngiven. Personalized profiles of
        the information behavior of every\\nscientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large\\nInternet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors,\\nthe data does not remain with the publishers, but flows
        out and can be\\nlinked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about
        the\\nperson. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of\\nevery
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science\\ncommunication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and\\ngovernmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.\\n\\n## Researchers at risk\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        are the consequences of this? First, it must be noted that this is\\na violation
        of fundamental rights: liberal societies have freedom of\\nresearch and teaching
        enshrined in their constitutions, but a monitored\\nfreedom is not. Thus,
        academic freedom as we knew it has come to its\\nend. But this is not merely
        an abstract shortcoming, because tracking\\ncan put scientists at concrete
        and grave risk. After all, in recent\\nyears we have seen that, as a researcher,
        you can get into trouble even\\nin countries where you would not have suspected
        it in the past: in one\\ncountry you don't make friends with research on climate
        change,\\\\[3\\\\] in\\nanother not with gender studies.\\\\[4\\\\] And in
        Hungary, the Central\\nEuropean University was chased out of the country.\\\\[5\\\\]
        Putting pressure\\non scientists is, of course, much easier when you know
        more about them,\\nand since their behavioral profiles are tradable, they
        are of course\\nopen to all interested actors, as long as they want to spend
        the\\nnecessary money.\\n\\nEconomic consequences are also foreseeable, be
        it either in the form of\\na distortion of competition to the detriment of
        publishers who act in a\\ntrustworthy manner and therefore do not track, or,
        above all, in the\\ndestruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future\\nfields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there\\nis strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby\\nthe
        commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and\\ndisseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata\\nmakes itself
        felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication\\nsurveillance: if you know
        who contacted each other, when, how often, and\\nin what sequence, you don't
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore,\\nit's all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being\\ntracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know\\nwhat they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And\\nsince it's not just one researcher who
        is being tracked and all the data\\ncan be analyzed together in business intelligence
        -- who will be faster\\nin filing a patent application? And will research
        results still benefit\\nthe public that paid for them?\\n\\nSo is it time
        to update the old joke \\\"Come to the dark side, we have\\ncookies\\\"? Absolutely.
        And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are\\ngoing to put a stop to
        third-party tracking, can we sit back because it\\nwill all have been an ugly
        transitional phase? Not at all. All the\\ninterested players are either busy
        monopolizing data access for\\nthemselves, like Google, or continuing to find
        ways for themselves, like\\nothers. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are\\nyou'll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your\\ninformation behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to\\nset a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.\\\\[6\\\\]\\nElsevier,
        as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the\\ngroup's Risk
        Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its\\nScienceDirect platform,
        a technology that boasts of being able to\\nindividually identify billions
        of devices and, if you recall the\\ndiscussion about ebay, does not shy away
        from port scanning.\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        the ScienceDirect-platform\_\\n\\nThe argument about authentication is also
        far from over\\\\[8\\\\], and\\npublishers sometimes use sleazy methods to
        enforce their wishes. In\\n2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out
        deadlines for switching\\nto seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown,
        and those who\\ndidn't keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to\\nnew access rules.\\\\[9\\\\] Using the same instrument over the
        Christmas\\nholidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation\\nof
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows\\ninformation
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The\\ngoal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because\\nthis is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are\\nhardly accepted there;
        currently Elsevier and SpringerNature are\\nconsidering infiltrating Trojans
        into university networks via the\\nlibraries in order to be able to collect
        biometric data such as typing\\nspeed or types of mouse movement in order
        to be able to identify users\\nin other areas of the Internet as well.\\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\nSo
        what is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they\\nwant
        to expand their unassailable position in information access to the\\nentire
        research life cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those\\nconcluded
        by Elsevier in the Netherlands, under which researchers can\\npublish open
        access at no extra cost if the universities license\\nElsevier products in
        the area of research information systems in\\nreturn.\\\\[11\\\\] Such contracts
        are disastrous, because it will be\\nimmediately clear to all researchers
        that their research will only be\\nproperly noted in the next evaluation if
        it also ends up in the\\nappropriate journals. Consequently, the market for
        both publication and\\nresearch information systems will quickly clear up
        as a result of this\\nlinkage business, and then the platform will have moved
        a step closer to\\nits goal again: namely, that it is not science, universities
        or research\\nfunders who determine which research is the \\\"right\\\" one
        and how much it\\n\\\"counts\\\"\\\\[12\\\\] but rather the platform who makes
        the determination.\\n\\nSuch deals seem like revenants from the nineties,
        when, in the [browser\\nwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
        Microsoft knocked\\nNetscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows.\\nAnother revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if
        libraries\\nhad dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing\\npublishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making\\nself archiving
        worthless by signing up for package licenses\\\\[13\\\\] (which\\nis why the
        head of SpringerNature called package licenses \\\"the best\\ninvention since
        sliced bread\\\"\\\\[14\\\\]), now they are once again holding\\nout for publishers,
        where publishers are having their Napster moment\\nthrough SciHub. By partnering
        with publishers to commercialize open\\naccess through publication fees, libraries
        are trying to crisis-proof\\ntheir business: as long as science governance
        doesn't change, scientists\\nwill have to publish in the appropriate journals,
        and libraries will\\nprevail precisely in the area of accounting and managing
        publication\\ncosts so they can continue to justify their staff and budgets.
        As a\\nresult, publication fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in\\nsome
        cases\\\\[15\\\\] -- so there is always enough money with the publishers\\nto
        continue to outspend, out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any\\nalternatives
        that are developed from within the scientific community.\\nAnd, moreover,
        DEAL contracts in Germany are already beginning to\\ndistort competition from
        publishers in favor of the big players on whom\\nthe negotiations are focused
        -- adding even more more money to even\\nfewer players.\\\\[16\\\\]\\n\\n##

        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and\\nanalyzed in Palantir's analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and\\ntools are sold globally just as the
        data they feed is collected\\nglobally, illegal immigrants don't have to be
        the only ones they're used\\nagainst -- the respective interested parties
        can surely think of\\nsomething -- and library money is supporting these systems
        of\\nsurveillance.\\\\[19\\\\] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state\\nand
        commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get\\nwhatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any\\nlonger on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search\\nwarrant. The motto of
        a data broker applies, who, when asked who was\\nactually exchanging data
        with whom, replied: \\\"Everyone with everyone.\\nIt's one\\\\[2\\\\]\_ big
        whorehouse.\\\"\\\\[20\\\\]\\n\\nSo where do we stand? We have seen in the
        past that, due to the special\\nsituation of the Cold War, the major scientific
        publishers grew into an\\nearly form of platform economy, long before the
        large Internet\\ncorporations adapted this principle and were thus able to
        achieve their\\ncurrent position.\\\\[21\\\\] With their work on the Trojans,
        the publishers\\nare also revealing geopolitical interests, namely to cut
        off entire\\nstates from the flow of scientific information, and are thus
        part of a\\nCold War 4.0.\\\\[22\\\\] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with\\nscientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also
        had to\\nrecognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their
        actual\\npurpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has
        been\\nanalyzed time and again in the past\\\\[23\\\\], but only now, through
        the\\nreplication crisis and every glance at [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/),
        is it becoming clear how the\\ncompulsion for storytelling, the fudging of
        data, and the fight for the\\nsmallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from\\nwithin. Leading players in science communication
        will have no problem\\nwith this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen
        journals in the past\\nthat claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells
        rented out to\\npharmaceutical companies to be filled.\\\\[24\\\\] And the
        parent company RELX\\nengages in political landscaping with donations to climate
        change\\ndeniers and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.\\\\[25\\\\]\\nAll
        this can only happen almost without contradiction because\\ninfrastructure
        is still a largely blind spot in science governance. More\\nand more voices
        are calling for an \\\"infrastructural turn\\\",\\\\[26\\\\] but\\neven in
        the welcome European initiatives the old mistakes are being\\nmade, because
        in the European Open Science Cloud Elsevier has\\nnested\\\\[27\\\\] just
        as ORE is run by F1000 Research -- which has been\\nbought up by Taylor &
        Francis.\\\\[28\\\\]\\n\\nSo parts of the scientific information infrastructures
        are increasingly\\nmoving toward the dark money complex, as characterized
        by the Koch\\nbrothers, or even by Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge\\nAnalytica
        possible. If you read Christopher Wylie's report on this\\\\[29\\\\]\\nand
        compare it with Shoshana Zuboff's analysis of surveillance\\ncapitalism\\\\[30\\\\],
        you will see that science and antiscience\\\\[31\\\\] are\\nincreasingly amalgamating
        into a confusing tangle, because in the same\\nway that this system could
        not be operated at all without a developed\\nscientific education, it is at
        the same time laying the axe to the\\nfoundations of truth, enlightenment
        and social liberties. In discourse,\\nthis becomes clear in the meteoric rise
        of half-truths, which are used\\nby conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic
        players, as well as the\\nmedia -- and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg
        Peters recently\\ndeveloped this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie's \\\"Science
        Fictions\\\"\\nas a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards\\nunreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront
        of\\nattention.\\\\[32\\\\] Not from the perspective of an economist, but
        of a\\nliterary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that\\nno
        longer operates according to the scheme true/false, but according to\\nschemes
        such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and\\nconnective/closed. What
        is central, she says, is internal coherence and\\nno longer correspondence
        with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,\\ncould no longer be resolved
        with a fact check, but only with a fiction\\ncheck, which highlights how the
        half-truth builds a narrative around a\\ncrystallization core of truth while
        pretending to report facts.\\\\[33\\\\] We\\nfind much of this in the corrupted
        information infrastructures, such as\\nthe impossibility for the reviewer
        to follow documents of a 21st century\\ndata-driven science to the ground
        of fact within a 17th century\\npublication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on\\ncredibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently\\nexposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same
        justification\\nphrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist
        Claas\\nRelotius.\\\\[34\\\\]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter all -- when we
        talk about power and power abuse in academia, the\\ninformation infrastructures
        must not be forgotten. They are in your lab,\\nthey are in your life, they're
        corrupting the truth, they're selling\\nyour ass and there is little you can
        do about it.\\\\[35\\\\] Nevertheless, it\\nremains the responsibility of
        each individual to reflect on this for\\ntheir actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal\\nYarkoni states in his great rant:\\n\\n>
        \\\"When people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and\\n>
        The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It's\\n> very
        hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone\\n> believes
        (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way\\n> to get by.\\\"\\\\[36\\\\]\\n\\nGaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins.\\nActing
        responsibly, on the other hand, means supporting and improving\\nexisting
        European initiatives. In Germany, this is currently being done,\\namong other
        things, through the National Research Data Infrastructure\\n(NFDI), which
        is cooperative and public. This path must be expanded, and\\nthe mistakes
        from the literature supply must be avoided at all costs.\\nScience will never
        be happy again as long as the big players remain in\\nthe game. The success
        of the NFDI is all the more crucial because in the\\ndata-driven sciences,
        data, software and text belong in a common context\\nso that results can be
        verified and immediately developed further. For\\nscientists, the current
        situation is like when a programmer first writes\\nhis code, then publishes
        an article about it, and the next programmer\\ntries to guess the code from
        the article and then creates an improved\\nversion. Sounds highly efficient?
        And that's exactly why GitHub exists\\n-- and a trusted, powerful and non-buyable
        version of it would be\\nexactly what science needs.\\\\[37\\\\]\\n\\nAnd
        before I forget -- there is one more thing you can easily do: join\\nthe community
        of scientists who don't want everything done to them and\\nsign the [Stop

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded

        paper [is\\nretracted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9).\\n\\nThat's
        a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper. And it raises a\\nlot of
        questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:\\n\\n> We, the authors, are
        retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate\\n> information from remaining
        in the literature. Although the description\\n> of *Oculudentavis khaungraae*
        remains accurate, a new unpublished\\n> specimen casts doubts upon our hypothesis
        regarding the phylogenetic\\n> position of HPG-15-3.\\n\\nBut we constantly
        see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are\\noverturned by new specimens.
        We usually deal with this by writing a new\\npaper. Why, in this case, is
        there a retraction? Something smells wrong\\nhere.\\n\\nAnd the plot thickens
        in [Retraction Watch's\\naccount](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/):\\ncorresponding
        author Jingmai O'Connor told them:\\n\\n> I don't agree with the retraction
        but there is no point in fighting\\n> it, so we all signed it.\\n>\\n> I cannot
        say why *Nature* chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on\\n> their inner
        machinations. \\\\[...\\\\] It is also not that unusual for\\n> paleontologists
        to misidentify things and for new information to\\n> correct previous hypotheses.
        However, *Nature* chose not to publish\\n> the Matter's Arising and instead
        retracts our paper -- they must have\\n> their reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the\\n*authors* retracted
        the original paper --- yet the corresponding author\\nsays that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors' will.\\n\\nI don't know what's going
        on here. I agree with O'Connor that \\\"It's\\nunfortunate because this way
        science can't simply correct itself (as it\\nis supposed to do)\\\". If, as
        Li et al. (2000) argue, *Oculudentavis* is\\nactually a squamate (lizard),
        well, fine: they can publish their\\nconclusion, and the community will arrive
        at a consensus as to which\\nidentification is correct. That's how it works,
        right? So why the\\nretraction?\\n\\nAnd there's more: what does this mean
        for zoological nomenclature? Is\\nthe name *Oculudentavis khaungraae* still
        nomenclaturally valid?\\nOpinions on this seem to vary (see [the Dinosaur
        Mailing List thread\\nbeginning with Ben Creisler's announcement of the\\nretraction](http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156).)\\n\\nI
        lean to the interpretation that, since the [International Code on\\nZoological\\nNomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/)\\ndoes
        not mention retractions, it implicitly takes the position that a\\npaper once
        published is published forever. On that basis, the name\\n*Oculudentavis*
        remains valid and attached to the holoype specimen ---\\neven if that name,
        with its *-avis* suffix, proves to have been poorly\\nchosen in pertaining
        to a non-bird. (After all, there is plenty of\\nprecedent for misleading names
        staying in place: the whale\\n*Basilosaurus* is not a saurian, and the clade
        of \\\"false crocodiles\\\"\\nPseudosuchia includes the true crocodiles.)\\n\\nThis
        doesn't seem to be what Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook\\nexchange forwarded
        to me by a friend who I will leave anonymous unless\\nhe or she chooses to
        out him or herself, Henry Gee comments \\\"The\\nretraction means the paper
        is erased from the record, and this includes\\nthe name\\\".\\n\\n[![](https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png){.alignnone\\n.size-full

        think this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments\\nfrom

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence

        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On
        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in

        makes that easy.\\n\\nThe Jupyter notebook that I started and [made available

        all blog posts using a search term and some other conditions\\n(here written
        in English and published after 2010). I thought a good\\nsearch term to try
        out the concept would be **Retraction Watch**, after\\nthe [announcement in\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        that\\n*Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions

        query for that search term returned 17 blog posts included in Rogue\\nScholar

        Conclusions\\n\\nThe notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish
        the\\nfirst overlay blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting\\napproach
        to automate the generating of overlay blog posts, open to\\neveryone as the
        content of the Rogue Scholar API is freely available for\\nreuse. I particularly
        like using both automation and manual curation\\nusing open source tools,
        which is a powerful combination\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner, M. (2023).

        to the database, for now, is via the Crossref Labs API, which I write and
        maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits in between the user and the Live API
        to inject new experimental metadata fields. The API can also serve files,

        is: how can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what
        we call a \\\"filter\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult
        to do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it's so difficult is because the
        Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about
        retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries
        that have retractions means building a separate index of all items with retractions,
        then fetching these, and paging through them with the user's requests. This
        gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load,
        and I don't recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to
        no avail. So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full
        list of retractions. We'll continue to work on an API solution, but it's going
        to take us a bit longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime, publishers: please continue
        to deposit retractions. It's really important and we need to end the culture

        Nomad</a>\_\_continued to evolve as well. The browser extension which launched
        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database
        data, ingested OA data from Unpaywall.This eventually lead to <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=libkey+2022+oadmap&sca_esv=559122478&rlz=1C1ONGR_enSG1005SG1005&sxsrf=AB5stBgme0F0eGgE3ffO7x4bCj-wbu-JBw%3A1692728002567&ei=wvrkZJyiIoe9seMPyL-ssAc&ved=0ahUKEwici62a7_CAAxWHXmwGHcgfC3YQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=libkey+2022+oadmap&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEmxpYmtleSAyMDIyIG9hZG1hcEjgDVCmBVjxC3ABeACQAQCYAVSgAbcCqgEBNbgBA8gBAPgBAcICBxAjGLACGCfiAwQYASBBiAYB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:167feea9,vid:zt9Nz5kDT34\\\">ThirdIron
        hosting information of Unpaywall and OA availability data themselves locally
        so libraries could collectively report and correct incorrect OA availabilty
        information.</a></p><p>It is fair to say that up to 2023 compared to Lean
        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally
        did the same with<a href=\\\"https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594927-libkey-nomad-e-books-linking\\\">\_LibKey
        Nomad E-Books Linking, first supporting Alma libraries in March 2023.</a></p><p>Also
        in 2023, <a href=\\\"https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/Third+Iron+2023+Product+Roadmap+Recap.pdf\\\">Third
        Iron launched a new product -\_LibKey Nomad++</a>. It added the \\\"domain
        intelligent messaging and custom linking, LibChat integration,, integration
        with popular bibliographic management tools, and options to customize and
        brand the extension\\\"</p><p>Some of it like domain intelligent messaging
        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing
        on linking to content but to allow other types of library intergration.....</p><p><br

        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco

        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One

        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta

        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,

        this seems fine and dandy but how does this browser extension know\\nwhat
        your institution has? According [to this\\narticle](https://www.johila.org/index.php/Johila/article/view/143/212),\\n\\\\\\\"the
        access to subscribed content only works for libraries using\\nEBSCO\\\\'s
        Holdings Management tool\\\\\\\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKYUa5duJstn5DRBN-5SaTkx9buVgIAtWTYQrK3ofT-oQoSYWNS7mO-jDtGzPiG5BykdVA7hHLou9W_mhTxJAvlObm7o8Rig4_LUgaNh1rdqaocd4WBabUwzVX3QCxVxOHScwSyihn3AnYNNcRYV2jIRRxSeVYUPwJWD7kizKSfEQIqjh3aCJwmpw3EErV/w640-h286/ebscopassport4.png){border=\\\"0\\\"\\noriginal-height=\\\"234\\\"

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to

        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        Siems</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn December 2018, a University of
        Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson,\\nparticipated in a workshop hosted
        by the [Coalition for Networked\\nInformation](https://www.cni.org/). The
        topic of this, and a number of\\nother events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more\\nfully integrate authentication systems for
        accessing electronic media\\ninto their platforms. Under various labels such
        as \\\"Research Access 21\\n(RA21)\\\", \\\"Seamless Access\\\", or \\\"Get
        Full Text Research (GetFTR)\\\", they\\nwant to replace the authentication
        options previously supported by\\nlibraries and academic institutions, such
        as IP range activation, VPN,\\nproxy servers, or anonymous authentication
        to neutral third parties, as\\nwith the Shibboleth service, in favor of their
        own initiatives.\\\\[1\\\\] For\\nyears, librarians have countered these moves
        with their concerns that it\\nwill undermine the privacy of their users. Even
        at the event where Cody\\nHanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National\\nInformation Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly\\nnoting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information\\n(PII)
        to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact,\\nservices
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a\\nsingle sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) -- it's\\njust that the
        technical realization is different. But then, to calm the\\ndiscussion, Carpenter
        added, \\\"that publishers don't need PII from RA21\\nto be able to identify
        library users.\\\" And that statement, of course,\\nwas absolutely designed
        to allay any concerns.\\n\\nCody Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing
        privacy-compliant access\\nto electronic media for his users, began to wonder.
        Should this be true\\nand can an analysis of the source code of publisher
        platform pages\\nprovide evidence of if and how publishers can identify library
        users?\\nCody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded\\ndocuments
        at his university and looked at them to see which platforms\\nwere represented
        in them. He picked one document from each of the\\nfifteen platforms found,
        examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,\\nand downloaded the document
        page to examine the source code. Several\\nthousand lines of JavaScript later,
        Cody Hanson came to a simple answer:\\nyes, it's true, Carpenter was right.\\n\\nOf
        the fifteen platforms examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on\\nthe
        others, he found a total of 139 different third-party asset sources.\\nAdTech's
        entire technical assortment was represented: simple trackers,\\naudience tools
        like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and\\nfingerprinters like Doubleclick.
        These finds were significant to Cody\\nHanson:\\n\\n\\\"The reason I was interested
        in third-party assets being loaded on these\\nsites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the\\nentire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address\\nand contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that\\nhappens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from\\nadditional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts
        JavaScript\\nfrom Google on its pages, Google can record any information from
        the\\npage about the article being sought, or search terms from a library
        user\\nin the publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms\\nincluded
        Google code on the article page.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nFacebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of\\nother data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a\\ngiven. Personalized profiles of
        the information behavior of every\\nscientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large\\nInternet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors,\\nthe data does not remain with the publishers, but flows
        out and can be\\nlinked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about
        the\\nperson. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of\\nevery
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science\\ncommunication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and\\ngovernmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.\\n\\n## Researchers at risk\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        are the consequences of this? First, it must be noted that this is\\na violation
        of fundamental rights: liberal societies have freedom of\\nresearch and teaching
        enshrined in their constitutions, but a monitored\\nfreedom is not. Thus,
        academic freedom as we knew it has come to its\\nend. But this is not merely
        an abstract shortcoming, because tracking\\ncan put scientists at concrete
        and grave risk. After all, in recent\\nyears we have seen that, as a researcher,
        you can get into trouble even\\nin countries where you would not have suspected
        it in the past: in one\\ncountry you don't make friends with research on climate
        change,\\\\[3\\\\] in\\nanother not with gender studies.\\\\[4\\\\] And in
        Hungary, the Central\\nEuropean University was chased out of the country.\\\\[5\\\\]
        Putting pressure\\non scientists is, of course, much easier when you know
        more about them,\\nand since their behavioral profiles are tradable, they
        are of course\\nopen to all interested actors, as long as they want to spend
        the\\nnecessary money.\\n\\nEconomic consequences are also foreseeable, be
        it either in the form of\\na distortion of competition to the detriment of
        publishers who act in a\\ntrustworthy manner and therefore do not track, or,
        above all, in the\\ndestruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future\\nfields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there\\nis strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby\\nthe
        commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and\\ndisseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata\\nmakes itself
        felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication\\nsurveillance: if you know
        who contacted each other, when, how often, and\\nin what sequence, you don't
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore,\\nit's all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being\\ntracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know\\nwhat they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And\\nsince it's not just one researcher who
        is being tracked and all the data\\ncan be analyzed together in business intelligence
        -- who will be faster\\nin filing a patent application? And will research
        results still benefit\\nthe public that paid for them?\\n\\nSo is it time
        to update the old joke \\\"Come to the dark side, we have\\ncookies\\\"? Absolutely.
        And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are\\ngoing to put a stop to
        third-party tracking, can we sit back because it\\nwill all have been an ugly
        transitional phase? Not at all. All the\\ninterested players are either busy
        monopolizing data access for\\nthemselves, like Google, or continuing to find
        ways for themselves, like\\nothers. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are\\nyou'll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your\\ninformation behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to\\nset a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.\\\\[6\\\\]\\nElsevier,
        as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the\\ngroup's Risk

        far from over\\\\[8\\\\], and\\npublishers sometimes use sleazy methods to
        enforce their wishes. In\\n2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out
        deadlines for switching\\nto seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown,

        biometric data such as typing\\nspeed or types of mouse movement in order

        what is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they\\nwant
        to expand their unassailable position in information access to the\\nentire
        research life cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those\\nconcluded
        by Elsevier in the Netherlands, under which researchers can\\npublish open
        access at no extra cost if the universities license\\nElsevier products in
        the area of research information systems in\\nreturn.\\\\[11\\\\] Such contracts
        are disastrous, because it will be\\nimmediately clear to all researchers
        that their research will only be\\nproperly noted in the next evaluation if
        it also ends up in the\\nappropriate journals. Consequently, the market for
        both publication and\\nresearch information systems will quickly clear up
        as a result of this\\nlinkage business, and then the platform will have moved
        a step closer to\\nits goal again: namely, that it is not science, universities
        or research\\nfunders who determine which research is the \\\"right\\\" one
        and how much it\\n\\\"counts\\\"\\\\[12\\\\] but rather the platform who makes
        the determination.\\n\\nSuch deals seem like revenants from the nineties,
        when, in the [browser\\nwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
        Microsoft knocked\\nNetscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows.\\nAnother revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if
        libraries\\nhad dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing\\npublishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making\\nself archiving
        worthless by signing up for package licenses\\\\[13\\\\] (which\\nis why the
        head of SpringerNature called package licenses \\\"the best\\ninvention since
        sliced bread\\\"\\\\[14\\\\]), now they are once again holding\\nout for publishers,
        where publishers are having their Napster moment\\nthrough SciHub. By partnering
        with publishers to commercialize open\\naccess through publication fees, libraries
        are trying to crisis-proof\\ntheir business: as long as science governance
        doesn't change, scientists\\nwill have to publish in the appropriate journals,
        and libraries will\\nprevail precisely in the area of accounting and managing
        publication\\ncosts so they can continue to justify their staff and budgets.
        As a\\nresult, publication fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in\\nsome
        cases\\\\[15\\\\] -- so there is always enough money with the publishers\\nto
        continue to outspend, out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any\\nalternatives
        that are developed from within the scientific community.\\nAnd, moreover,
        DEAL contracts in Germany are already beginning to\\ndistort competition from
        publishers in favor of the big players on whom\\nthe negotiations are focused
        -- adding even more more money to even\\nfewer players.\\\\[16\\\\]\\n\\n##

        a suspect\_</a></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nBut for some players in
        scholarly communication, this is no longer\\nenough. Thomson Reuters and RELX
        have discovered the global security\\nindustry as a buyer of their data analytics
        products, and have signed\\nbig data policing contracts with law enforcement
        organizations like\_\\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that
        use these tools to\\ntrack immigrants.\\\\[17\\\\] Since both publishers are
        central providers of\\nspecialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the\\nmoment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or\\nLexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby\\ncontributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.\\\\[18\\\\] The\\npublishers,
        of course, dismiss it all -- and at the same time continue\\nto escalate the
        path taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir,\\nand so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and\\nanalyzed in Palantir's analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and\\ntools are sold globally just as the
        data they feed is collected\\nglobally, illegal immigrants don't have to be
        the only ones they're used\\nagainst -- the respective interested parties
        can surely think of\\nsomething -- and library money is supporting these systems
        of\\nsurveillance.\\\\[19\\\\] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state\\nand
        commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get\\nwhatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any\\nlonger on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search\\nwarrant. The motto of
        a data broker applies, who, when asked who was\\nactually exchanging data
        with whom, replied: \\\"Everyone with everyone.\\nIt's one\\\\[2\\\\]\_ big
        whorehouse.\\\"\\\\[20\\\\]\\n\\nSo where do we stand? We have seen in the
        past that, due to the special\\nsituation of the Cold War, the major scientific
        publishers grew into an\\nearly form of platform economy, long before the
        large Internet\\ncorporations adapted this principle and were thus able to
        achieve their\\ncurrent position.\\\\[21\\\\] With their work on the Trojans,
        the publishers\\nare also revealing geopolitical interests, namely to cut
        off entire\\nstates from the flow of scientific information, and are thus
        part of a\\nCold War 4.0.\\\\[22\\\\] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with\\nscientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also
        had to\\nrecognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their
        actual\\npurpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has
        been\\nanalyzed time and again in the past\\\\[23\\\\], but only now, through
        the\\nreplication crisis and every glance at [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/),
        is it becoming clear how the\\ncompulsion for storytelling, the fudging of
        data, and the fight for the\\nsmallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from\\nwithin. Leading players in science communication
        will have no problem\\nwith this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen
        journals in the past\\nthat claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells
        rented out to\\npharmaceutical companies to be filled.\\\\[24\\\\] And the
        parent company RELX\\nengages in political landscaping with donations to climate
        change\\ndeniers and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.\\\\[25\\\\]\\nAll
        this can only happen almost without contradiction because\\ninfrastructure
        is still a largely blind spot in science governance. More\\nand more voices
        are calling for an \\\"infrastructural turn\\\",\\\\[26\\\\] but\\neven in
        the welcome European initiatives the old mistakes are being\\nmade, because
        in the European Open Science Cloud Elsevier has\\nnested\\\\[27\\\\] just
        as ORE is run by F1000 Research -- which has been\\nbought up by Taylor &
        Francis.\\\\[28\\\\]\\n\\nSo parts of the scientific information infrastructures
        are increasingly\\nmoving toward the dark money complex, as characterized
        by the Koch\\nbrothers, or even by Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge\\nAnalytica
        possible. If you read Christopher Wylie's report on this\\\\[29\\\\]\\nand
        compare it with Shoshana Zuboff's analysis of surveillance\\ncapitalism\\\\[30\\\\],
        you will see that science and antiscience\\\\[31\\\\] are\\nincreasingly amalgamating
        into a confusing tangle, because in the same\\nway that this system could
        not be operated at all without a developed\\nscientific education, it is at
        the same time laying the axe to the\\nfoundations of truth, enlightenment
        and social liberties. In discourse,\\nthis becomes clear in the meteoric rise
        of half-truths, which are used\\nby conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic
        players, as well as the\\nmedia -- and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg
        Peters recently\\ndeveloped this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie's \\\"Science
        Fictions\\\"\\nas a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards\\nunreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront
        of\\nattention.\\\\[32\\\\] Not from the perspective of an economist, but
        of a\\nliterary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that\\nno
        longer operates according to the scheme true/false, but according to\\nschemes
        such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and\\nconnective/closed. What
        is central, she says, is internal coherence and\\nno longer correspondence
        with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,\\ncould no longer be resolved
        with a fact check, but only with a fiction\\ncheck, which highlights how the
        half-truth builds a narrative around a\\ncrystallization core of truth while
        pretending to report facts.\\\\[33\\\\] We\\nfind much of this in the corrupted
        information infrastructures, such as\\nthe impossibility for the reviewer
        to follow documents of a 21st century\\ndata-driven science to the ground
        of fact within a 17th century\\npublication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on\\ncredibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently\\nexposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same
        justification\\nphrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist
        Claas\\nRelotius.\\\\[34\\\\]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter all -- when we
        talk about power and power abuse in academia, the\\ninformation infrastructures
        must not be forgotten. They are in your lab,\\nthey are in your life, they're
        corrupting the truth, they're selling\\nyour ass and there is little you can
        do about it.\\\\[35\\\\] Nevertheless, it\\nremains the responsibility of
        each individual to reflect on this for\\ntheir actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal\\nYarkoni states in his great rant:\\n\\n>
        \\\"When people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and\\n>
        The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It's\\n> very
        hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone\\n> believes
        (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way\\n> to get by.\\\"\\\\[36\\\\]\\n\\nGaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins.\\nActing
        responsibly, on the other hand, means supporting and improving\\nexisting
        European initiatives. In Germany, this is currently being done,\\namong other
        things, through the National Research Data Infrastructure\\n(NFDI), which
        is cooperative and public. This path must be expanded, and\\nthe mistakes
        from the literature supply must be avoided at all costs.\\nScience will never
        be happy again as long as the big players remain in\\nthe game. The success
        of the NFDI is all the more crucial because in the\\ndata-driven sciences,
        data, software and text belong in a common context\\nso that results can be
        verified and immediately developed further. For\\nscientists, the current
        situation is like when a programmer first writes\\nhis code, then publishes
        an article about it, and the next programmer\\ntries to guess the code from
        the article and then creates an improved\\nversion. Sounds highly efficient?
        And that's exactly why GitHub exists\\n-- and a trusted, powerful and non-buyable
        version of it would be\\nexactly what science needs.\\\\[37\\\\]\\n\\nAnd
        before I forget -- there is one more thing you can easily do: join\\nthe community
        of scientists who don't want everything done to them and\\nsign the [Stop

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the

        paper [is\\nretracted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9).\\n\\nThat's
        a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper. And it raises a\\nlot of
        questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:\\n\\n> We, the authors, are
        retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate\\n> information from remaining
        in the literature. Although the description\\n> of *Oculudentavis khaungraae*
        remains accurate, a new unpublished\\n> specimen casts doubts upon our hypothesis
        regarding the phylogenetic\\n> position of HPG-15-3.\\n\\nBut we constantly
        see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are\\noverturned by new specimens.
        We usually deal with this by writing a new\\npaper. Why, in this case, is
        there a retraction? Something smells wrong\\nhere.\\n\\nAnd the plot thickens
        in [Retraction Watch's\\naccount](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/):\\ncorresponding
        author Jingmai O'Connor told them:\\n\\n> I don't agree with the retraction
        but there is no point in fighting\\n> it, so we all signed it.\\n>\\n> I cannot
        say why *Nature* chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on\\n> their inner
        machinations. \\\\[...\\\\] It is also not that unusual for\\n> paleontologists
        to misidentify things and for new information to\\n> correct previous hypotheses.
        However, *Nature* chose not to publish\\n> the Matter's Arising and instead
        retracts our paper -- they must have\\n> their reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the\\n*authors* retracted
        the original paper --- yet the corresponding author\\nsays that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors' will.\\n\\nI don't know what's going
        on here. I agree with O'Connor that \\\"It's\\nunfortunate because this way
        science can't simply correct itself (as it\\nis supposed to do)\\\". If, as
        Li et al. (2000) argue, *Oculudentavis* is\\nactually a squamate (lizard),
        well, fine: they can publish their\\nconclusion, and the community will arrive
        at a consensus as to which\\nidentification is correct. That's how it works,
        right? So why the\\nretraction?\\n\\nAnd there's more: what does this mean
        for zoological nomenclature? Is\\nthe name *Oculudentavis khaungraae* still
        nomenclaturally valid?\\nOpinions on this seem to vary (see [the Dinosaur
        Mailing List thread\\nbeginning with Ben Creisler's announcement of the\\nretraction](http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156).)\\n\\nI
        lean to the interpretation that, since the [International Code on\\nZoological\\nNomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/)\\ndoes
        not mention retractions, it implicitly takes the position that a\\npaper once
        published is published forever. On that basis, the name\\n*Oculudentavis*
        remains valid and attached to the holoype specimen ---\\neven if that name,
        with its *-avis* suffix, proves to have been poorly\\nchosen in pertaining
        to a non-bird. (After all, there is plenty of\\nprecedent for misleading names
        staying in place: the whale\\n*Basilosaurus* is not a saurian, and the clade
        of \\\"false crocodiles\\\"\\nPseudosuchia includes the true crocodiles.)\\n\\nThis
        doesn't seem to be what Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook\\nexchange forwarded
        to me by a friend who I will leave anonymous unless\\nhe or she chooses to
        out him or herself, Henry Gee comments \\\"The\\nretraction means the paper
        is erased from the record, and this includes\\nthe name\\\".\\n\\n[![](https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png){.alignnone\\n.size-full

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On

        can I endure? This year, I started haemodialysis as my kidneys entered the
        extremely worryingly named \\\"end-stage renal failure\\\". This turns out
        to be a very long-term prospect, as I can't have a transplant owing both to
        BK viremia (which caused the kidney damage in the first place) and a conflict

        Today I am\\nreporting on the first Jupyter notebook using that API to generate
        an\\noverlay blog post.\\n\\n> An\_**overlay journal**\_or\_**overlay ejournal**\_is

        has an open license\\n([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"})\\n--
        makes that easy.\\n\\nThe Jupyter notebook that I started and [made available

        all blog posts using a search term and some other conditions\\n(here written
        in English and published after 2010). I thought a good\\nsearch term to try
        out the concept would be **Retraction Watch**, after\\nthe [announcement in\\nSeptember](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}
        that\\n*Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch database of expressions

        sort the results in reverse chronological order\\n(newest first).\\n:::\\n:::\\n\\nThe
        query for that search term returned 17 blog posts included in Rogue\\nScholar
        (out of about 9,000 posts), and manual curation narrowed that\\nlist further
        down to 12 posts (visualized with\\n[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer\\\"}):\\n\\n<figure

        Conclusions\\n\\nThe notebook needs some more fine-tuning, and I plan to publish
        the\\nfirst overlay blog post next week. But notebooks are an interesting\\napproach
        to automate the generating of overlay blog posts, open to\\neveryone as the
        content of the Rogue Scholar API is freely available for\\nreuse. I particularly
        like using both automation and manual curation\\nusing open source tools,
        which is a powerful combination\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFenner, M. (2023).

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That
        means we have achieved sustainability -- the highest priority\\ngoal for any
        nonprofit -- for the database side of our operation. And\\nthe acquisition
        fee provides important unrestricted reserves that allow\\nfor breathing room
        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        in 2019, basically added retraction signal posting via Retraction Watch Database

        Library, Libkey Nomad even the Libkey Suite (that includes Libkey Discovery,
        Libkey Link and Libkey.io) focused mainly on delivery or providing access
        to things users wanted without going out to helping with the discovery aspect.</p><p>There
        was one exception, support of linking to ebooks. This was a feature long available
        in Lean Library (with varying degree of comprehensiveness) and Libkey finally

        and custom linking, LibChat Integration look very similar to existing features
        in Lean Library and seems to signal Third Iron moving away from just focusing

        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        using my institution find that this is true. For my\\ninstitution, it works
        okay if the content is in one of our subscribed\\ndatabases on ebscohost but
        it does not seem to know about holdings on\\nother platforms.\_\\n\\nThis
        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the
        Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco still knows what\\nEbsco databases we
        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso
        [Dimensions &\\nPapers](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/)).\_\\n\\nOne
        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June
        2023, so\\nthis is a preliminary look!\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstalling the browser
        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to

        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill

        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"

        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div

        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing
        you can easily do: join the community of scientists who don&#8217;t want everything
        done to them and sign the <a href=\\\"https://stoptrackingscience.eu/\\\">Stop

        Siems</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn December 2018, a University of
        Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson,\\nparticipated in a workshop hosted
        by the [Coalition for Networked\\nInformation](https://www.cni.org/). The
        topic of this, and a number of\\nother events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more\\nfully integrate authentication systems for
        accessing electronic media\\ninto their platforms. Under various labels such
        as \\\"Research Access 21\\n(RA21)\\\", \\\"Seamless Access\\\", or \\\"Get
        Full Text Research (GetFTR)\\\", they\\nwant to replace the authentication
        options previously supported by\\nlibraries and academic institutions, such
        as IP range activation, VPN,\\nproxy servers, or anonymous authentication
        to neutral third parties, as\\nwith the Shibboleth service, in favor of their
        own initiatives.\\\\[1\\\\] For\\nyears, librarians have countered these moves
        with their concerns that it\\nwill undermine the privacy of their users. Even
        at the event where Cody\\nHanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National\\nInformation Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly\\nnoting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information\\n(PII)
        to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact,\\nservices
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a\\nsingle sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) -- it's\\njust that the
        technical realization is different. But then, to calm the\\ndiscussion, Carpenter
        added, \\\"that publishers don't need PII from RA21\\nto be able to identify
        library users.\\\" And that statement, of course,\\nwas absolutely designed
        to allay any concerns.\\n\\nCody Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing
        privacy-compliant access\\nto electronic media for his users, began to wonder.
        Should this be true\\nand can an analysis of the source code of publisher
        platform pages\\nprovide evidence of if and how publishers can identify library
        users?\\nCody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded\\ndocuments
        at his university and looked at them to see which platforms\\nwere represented
        in them. He picked one document from each of the\\nfifteen platforms found,
        examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,\\nand downloaded the document
        page to examine the source code. Several\\nthousand lines of JavaScript later,
        Cody Hanson came to a simple answer:\\nyes, it's true, Carpenter was right.\\n\\nOf
        the fifteen platforms examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on\\nthe
        others, he found a total of 139 different third-party asset sources.\\nAdTech's
        entire technical assortment was represented: simple trackers,\\naudience tools
        like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and\\nfingerprinters like Doubleclick.
        These finds were significant to Cody\\nHanson:\\n\\n\\\"The reason I was interested
        in third-party assets being loaded on these\\nsites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the\\nentire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address\\nand contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that\\nhappens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from\\nadditional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts
        JavaScript\\nfrom Google on its pages, Google can record any information from
        the\\npage about the article being sought, or search terms from a library
        user\\nin the publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms\\nincluded
        Google code on the article page.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nFacebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of\\nother data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a\\ngiven. Personalized profiles of
        the information behavior of every\\nscientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large\\nInternet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors,\\nthe data does not remain with the publishers, but flows
        out and can be\\nlinked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about
        the\\nperson. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of\\nevery
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science\\ncommunication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and\\ngovernmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.\\n\\n## Researchers at risk\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        are the consequences of this? First, it must be noted that this is\\na violation
        of fundamental rights: liberal societies have freedom of\\nresearch and teaching
        enshrined in their constitutions, but a monitored\\nfreedom is not. Thus,
        academic freedom as we knew it has come to its\\nend. But this is not merely
        an abstract shortcoming, because tracking\\ncan put scientists at concrete
        and grave risk. After all, in recent\\nyears we have seen that, as a researcher,
        you can get into trouble even\\nin countries where you would not have suspected
        it in the past: in one\\ncountry you don't make friends with research on climate
        change,\\\\[3\\\\] in\\nanother not with gender studies.\\\\[4\\\\] And in
        Hungary, the Central\\nEuropean University was chased out of the country.\\\\[5\\\\]
        Putting pressure\\non scientists is, of course, much easier when you know
        more about them,\\nand since their behavioral profiles are tradable, they
        are of course\\nopen to all interested actors, as long as they want to spend
        the\\nnecessary money.\\n\\nEconomic consequences are also foreseeable, be
        it either in the form of\\na distortion of competition to the detriment of
        publishers who act in a\\ntrustworthy manner and therefore do not track, or,
        above all, in the\\ndestruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future\\nfields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there\\nis strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby\\nthe
        commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and\\ndisseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata\\nmakes itself
        felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication\\nsurveillance: if you know
        who contacted each other, when, how often, and\\nin what sequence, you don't
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore,\\nit's all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being\\ntracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know\\nwhat they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And\\nsince it's not just one researcher who
        is being tracked and all the data\\ncan be analyzed together in business intelligence
        -- who will be faster\\nin filing a patent application? And will research
        results still benefit\\nthe public that paid for them?\\n\\nSo is it time
        to update the old joke \\\"Come to the dark side, we have\\ncookies\\\"? Absolutely.
        And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are\\ngoing to put a stop to
        third-party tracking, can we sit back because it\\nwill all have been an ugly
        transitional phase? Not at all. All the\\ninterested players are either busy
        monopolizing data access for\\nthemselves, like Google, or continuing to find
        ways for themselves, like\\nothers. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are\\nyou'll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your\\ninformation behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to\\nset a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.\\\\[6\\\\]\\nElsevier,
        as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the\\ngroup's Risk
        Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its\\nScienceDirect platform,
        a technology that boasts of being able to\\nindividually identify billions
        of devices and, if you recall the\\ndiscussion about ebay, does not shy away
        from port scanning.\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        the ScienceDirect-platform\_\\n\\nThe argument about authentication is also
        far from over\\\\[8\\\\], and\\npublishers sometimes use sleazy methods to
        enforce their wishes. In\\n2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out
        deadlines for switching\\nto seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown,
        and those who\\ndidn't keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to\\nnew access rules.\\\\[9\\\\] Using the same instrument over the
        Christmas\\nholidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation\\nof
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows\\ninformation
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The\\ngoal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because\\nthis is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are\\nhardly accepted there;
        currently Elsevier and SpringerNature are\\nconsidering infiltrating Trojans
        into university networks via the\\nlibraries in order to be able to collect
        biometric data such as typing\\nspeed or types of mouse movement in order
        to be able to identify users\\nin other areas of the Internet as well.\\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\nSo
        what is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they\\nwant
        to expand their unassailable position in information access to the\\nentire
        research life cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those\\nconcluded
        by Elsevier in the Netherlands, under which researchers can\\npublish open
        access at no extra cost if the universities license\\nElsevier products in
        the area of research information systems in\\nreturn.\\\\[11\\\\] Such contracts
        are disastrous, because it will be\\nimmediately clear to all researchers
        that their research will only be\\nproperly noted in the next evaluation if
        it also ends up in the\\nappropriate journals. Consequently, the market for
        both publication and\\nresearch information systems will quickly clear up
        as a result of this\\nlinkage business, and then the platform will have moved
        a step closer to\\nits goal again: namely, that it is not science, universities
        or research\\nfunders who determine which research is the \\\"right\\\" one
        and how much it\\n\\\"counts\\\"\\\\[12\\\\] but rather the platform who makes
        the determination.\\n\\nSuch deals seem like revenants from the nineties,
        when, in the [browser\\nwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
        Microsoft knocked\\nNetscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows.\\nAnother revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if
        libraries\\nhad dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing\\npublishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making\\nself archiving
        worthless by signing up for package licenses\\\\[13\\\\] (which\\nis why the
        head of SpringerNature called package licenses \\\"the best\\ninvention since
        sliced bread\\\"\\\\[14\\\\]), now they are once again holding\\nout for publishers,
        where publishers are having their Napster moment\\nthrough SciHub. By partnering
        with publishers to commercialize open\\naccess through publication fees, libraries
        are trying to crisis-proof\\ntheir business: as long as science governance
        doesn't change, scientists\\nwill have to publish in the appropriate journals,
        and libraries will\\nprevail precisely in the area of accounting and managing
        publication\\ncosts so they can continue to justify their staff and budgets.
        As a\\nresult, publication fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in\\nsome
        cases\\\\[15\\\\] -- so there is always enough money with the publishers\\nto
        continue to outspend, out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any\\nalternatives
        that are developed from within the scientific community.\\nAnd, moreover,
        DEAL contracts in Germany are already beginning to\\ndistort competition from
        publishers in favor of the big players on whom\\nthe negotiations are focused
        -- adding even more more money to even\\nfewer players.\\\\[16\\\\]\\n\\n##

        had to\\nrecognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their
        actual\\npurpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has
        been\\nanalyzed time and again in the past\\\\[23\\\\], but only now, through
        the\\nreplication crisis and every glance at [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/),
        is it becoming clear how the\\ncompulsion for storytelling, the fudging of
        data, and the fight for the\\nsmallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from\\nwithin. Leading players in science communication
        will have no problem\\nwith this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen
        journals in the past\\nthat claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells
        rented out to\\npharmaceutical companies to be filled.\\\\[24\\\\] And the
        parent company RELX\\nengages in political landscaping with donations to climate
        change\\ndeniers and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.\\\\[25\\\\]\\nAll
        this can only happen almost without contradiction because\\ninfrastructure
        is still a largely blind spot in science governance. More\\nand more voices
        are calling for an \\\"infrastructural turn\\\",\\\\[26\\\\] but\\neven in
        the welcome European initiatives the old mistakes are being\\nmade, because
        in the European Open Science Cloud Elsevier has\\nnested\\\\[27\\\\] just
        as ORE is run by F1000 Research -- which has been\\nbought up by Taylor &
        Francis.\\\\[28\\\\]\\n\\nSo parts of the scientific information infrastructures
        are increasingly\\nmoving toward the dark money complex, as characterized
        by the Koch\\nbrothers, or even by Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge\\nAnalytica
        possible. If you read Christopher Wylie's report on this\\\\[29\\\\]\\nand
        compare it with Shoshana Zuboff's analysis of surveillance\\ncapitalism\\\\[30\\\\],
        you will see that science and antiscience\\\\[31\\\\] are\\nincreasingly amalgamating
        into a confusing tangle, because in the same\\nway that this system could
        not be operated at all without a developed\\nscientific education, it is at
        the same time laying the axe to the\\nfoundations of truth, enlightenment
        and social liberties. In discourse,\\nthis becomes clear in the meteoric rise
        of half-truths, which are used\\nby conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic
        players, as well as the\\nmedia -- and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg
        Peters recently\\ndeveloped this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie's \\\"Science
        Fictions\\\"\\nas a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards\\nunreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront
        of\\nattention.\\\\[32\\\\] Not from the perspective of an economist, but
        of a\\nliterary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that\\nno
        longer operates according to the scheme true/false, but according to\\nschemes
        such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and\\nconnective/closed. What
        is central, she says, is internal coherence and\\nno longer correspondence
        with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,\\ncould no longer be resolved
        with a fact check, but only with a fiction\\ncheck, which highlights how the
        half-truth builds a narrative around a\\ncrystallization core of truth while
        pretending to report facts.\\\\[33\\\\] We\\nfind much of this in the corrupted
        information infrastructures, such as\\nthe impossibility for the reviewer
        to follow documents of a 21st century\\ndata-driven science to the ground
        of fact within a 17th century\\npublication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on\\ncredibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently\\nexposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same
        justification\\nphrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist
        Claas\\nRelotius.\\\\[34\\\\]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter all -- when we
        talk about power and power abuse in academia, the\\ninformation infrastructures
        must not be forgotten. They are in your lab,\\nthey are in your life, they're
        corrupting the truth, they're selling\\nyour ass and there is little you can
        do about it.\\\\[35\\\\] Nevertheless, it\\nremains the responsibility of
        each individual to reflect on this for\\ntheir actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal\\nYarkoni states in his great rant:\\n\\n>
        \\\"When people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and\\n>
        The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It's\\n> very
        hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone\\n> believes
        (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way\\n> to get by.\\\"\\\\[36\\\\]\\n\\nGaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins.\\nActing
        responsibly, on the other hand, means supporting and improving\\nexisting
        European initiatives. In Germany, this is currently being done,\\namong other
        things, through the National Research Data Infrastructure\\n(NFDI), which
        is cooperative and public. This path must be expanded, and\\nthe mistakes
        from the literature supply must be avoided at all costs.\\nScience will never
        be happy again as long as the big players remain in\\nthe game. The success
        of the NFDI is all the more crucial because in the\\ndata-driven sciences,
        data, software and text belong in a common context\\nso that results can be
        verified and immediately developed further. For\\nscientists, the current
        situation is like when a programmer first writes\\nhis code, then publishes
        an article about it, and the next programmer\\ntries to guess the code from
        the article and then creates an improved\\nversion. Sounds highly efficient?
        And that's exactly why GitHub exists\\n-- and a trusted, powerful and non-buyable
        version of it would be\\nexactly what science needs.\\\\[37\\\\]\\n\\nAnd
        before I forget -- there is one more thing you can easily do: join\\nthe community
        of scientists who don't want everything done to them and\\nsign the [Stop

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        paper [is\\nretracted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9).\\n\\nThat's
        a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology paper. And it raises a\\nlot of
        questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:\\n\\n> We, the authors, are
        retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate\\n> information from remaining
        in the literature. Although the description\\n> of *Oculudentavis khaungraae*
        remains accurate, a new unpublished\\n> specimen casts doubts upon our hypothesis
        regarding the phylogenetic\\n> position of HPG-15-3.\\n\\nBut we constantly
        see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are\\noverturned by new specimens.
        We usually deal with this by writing a new\\npaper. Why, in this case, is
        there a retraction? Something smells wrong\\nhere.\\n\\nAnd the plot thickens
        in [Retraction Watch's\\naccount](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/):\\ncorresponding
        author Jingmai O'Connor told them:\\n\\n> I don't agree with the retraction
        but there is no point in fighting\\n> it, so we all signed it.\\n>\\n> I cannot
        say why *Nature* chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on\\n> their inner
        machinations. \\\\[...\\\\] It is also not that unusual for\\n> paleontologists
        to misidentify things and for new information to\\n> correct previous hypotheses.
        However, *Nature* chose not to publish\\n> the Matter's Arising and instead
        retracts our paper -- they must have\\n> their reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the\\n*authors* retracted
        the original paper --- yet the corresponding author\\nsays that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors' will.\\n\\nI don't know what's going
        on here. I agree with O'Connor that \\\"It's\\nunfortunate because this way
        science can't simply correct itself (as it\\nis supposed to do)\\\". If, as
        Li et al. (2000) argue, *Oculudentavis* is\\nactually a squamate (lizard),
        well, fine: they can publish their\\nconclusion, and the community will arrive
        at a consensus as to which\\nidentification is correct. That's how it works,
        right? So why the\\nretraction?\\n\\nAnd there's more: what does this mean
        for zoological nomenclature? Is\\nthe name *Oculudentavis khaungraae* still
        nomenclaturally valid?\\nOpinions on this seem to vary (see [the Dinosaur
        Mailing List thread\\nbeginning with Ben Creisler's announcement of the\\nretraction](http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156).)\\n\\nI
        lean to the interpretation that, since the [International Code on\\nZoological\\nNomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/)\\ndoes
        not mention retractions, it implicitly takes the position that a\\npaper once
        published is published forever. On that basis, the name\\n*Oculudentavis*
        remains valid and attached to the holoype specimen ---\\neven if that name,
        with its *-avis* suffix, proves to have been poorly\\nchosen in pertaining
        to a non-bird. (After all, there is plenty of\\nprecedent for misleading names
        staying in place: the whale\\n*Basilosaurus* is not a saurian, and the clade
        of \\\"false crocodiles\\\"\\nPseudosuchia includes the true crocodiles.)\\n\\nThis
        doesn't seem to be what Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook\\nexchange forwarded
        to me by a friend who I will leave anonymous unless\\nhe or she chooses to
        out him or herself, Henry Gee comments \\\"The\\nretraction means the paper
        is erased from the record, and this includes\\nthe name\\\".\\n\\n[![](https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png){.alignnone\\n.size-full

        think this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments\\nfrom

        help but suspect that something is going on here\\nthat's not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that\\nMyanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of\\nthe Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors\\nof the original *Oculudentavis* colluded
        in describing it as a bird when\\nthey knew it was something else? I don't
        know (and to be 100% clear, I\\nam *not* accusing anyone of anything). But
        I do know that *Nature*'s\\nvague and possibly misleading retraction notice
        is not helping, and is\\nnot in the spirit of transparency that we aim to
        cultivate in the\\nsciences.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure we don't yet know the full

        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher &#8216;Magnolia Press&#8217;
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International
        Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>&nbsp;and the Bacteriology and
        Applied Microbiology Division of the&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union
        of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I have
        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On
        Monday 29th June 2020, I learned [from Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/)\\nthat
        Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122\\nhas
        newly \\\"suppressed\\\" 33 journals from their indexing service. The\\nimmediate
        consequence of this \\\"suppression\\\" is that these 33 journals do\\nnot
        get assigned an official Clarivate *Journal Impact Factor* \u2122 .\\nClarivate
        justify this action on the basis of \\\"anomalous citation\\npatterns\\\"
        but without much further detail given for each of the journals\\nother than
        the overall \\\"% Self-cites\\\" of the journal, and the effect of\\nthose
        self-cites on Clarivate's citation-based ranking of journals (%\\nDistortion
        of category rank).\\n\\nAmongst the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two\\n[systematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics)
        journals that I\\nknow very well:\\n\\n- [Zootaxa](https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/)\\n
        \ - published by a small independent publisher 'Magnolia Press' based in\\n
        \   New Zealand\\n- [International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary\\n
        \ Microbiology](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem)\\n
        \ - published by the Microbiology Society\\n  - the official publication of
        the\_[International Committee on\\n    Systematics of\\n    Prokaryotes](https://www.the-icsp.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer
        noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\_and the Bacteriology and Applied
        Microbiology\\n    Division of the\_[International Union of Microbiological\\n
        \   Societies](https://www.iums.org/){rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"}\\n\\nI
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis)\\narticles
        from both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my [PhD\\nthesis](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021)\\nmined
        over 12,000 *Zootaxa* articles looking for phylogenetic data. In a\\nmore
        [recent work published in Research Ideas and\\nOutcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589)
        (RIO Journal), I mined\\nover 5,800 *IJSEM* articles for [phylogenetic\\ntree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree)
        data. Of\\nrelevance, I should also say I was a council member of the [Systematics\\nAssociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association)
        for\\nmany years.\\n\\nGiven the experiences listed above, I am therefore
        very well placed to\\nsay that what Clarivate has done to these two systematics
        journals is\\nutter brainless idiocy.\\n\\nThe reason why *Zootaxa* articles
        cite quite a high proportion of other\\n*Zootaxa* articles is obvious (\\\"self-citation\\\"
        at the journal-level from\\nClarivate's point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline.
        *Zootaxa* is an\\nimportant 'megajournal' for the zoological systematics community.\\nAccording
        to [lens.org\\ndata](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&p=0&n=10&s=_score&d=%2B&f=false&e=false&l=en&authorField=author&dateFilterField=publishedYear&presentation=false&preview=&stemmed=true&useAuthorId=false&sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&publishedYear.from=2018&publishedYear.to=2019)\\nZootaxa
        published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between\\n2018 and 2019.
        Clarivate's own records from another one of their\\nproprietary analytics
        services called '[Zoological\\nRecord](http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj)'
        indicate\\nthat 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published in *Zootaxa*.
        For\\nmany decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out of for-profit\\njournals.
        *Zootaxa* is a vital refugia for sound science in a poorly\\nfunded discipline.\\n\\nThe
        case for legitimate 'high' journal-level self-citation at\\n*International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology*\\n(*IJSEM*) is even clearer
        and easier to explain. The [International Code\\nof Nomenclature of\\nProkaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes)\\n(ICNP)
        ***requires*** that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM\\nand nowhere
        else (a very sensible idea which the bacteriology community\\nshould be commended
        for). Hence a lot of the systematic and evolutionary\\nmicrobiology articles
        in IJSEM will cite prior IJSEM articles.\\n\\nWayne Maddison has\\n[commented](https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040)\\non
        Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be\\nthose in
        developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many\\ninstitutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.

        big news is that \\\\[Crossref has acquired the Retraction Watch\\ndatabase
        of expressions of concerns and retractions and has made it\\nopenly accessible
        to anyone who wants to use\\nit\\\\](https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9). I\\\\'m
        waiting for full\\nconfirmation of the license or public domain dedication
        under which it\\nwill be released, but this is still a great commitment of
        Crossref to\\nthe POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good
        for science\\nand scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows
        about\\napproximately 50,000 retractions. Access to the database, for now,
        is\\nvia the Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs\\nAPI
        sits in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental\\nmetadata
        fields. The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of\\nthe latest
        Retraction Watch data at\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nMeanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the\\ncr-labs-updates entry
        if you visit a work that has data, e.g.\\nhttps://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=\\\\[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE\\\\].\\nThe
        obvious question (and one that \\\\[was asked within an hour of our\\nlaunch\\\\](https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877))
        is:\\nhow can I retrieve a list of all retractions via the API? This is what\\nwe
        call a \\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\" in the API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very
        difficult\\nto do in the Labs API. The Reasons\xAE that it\\\\'s so difficult
        is because\\nthe Labs API gets its data by pulling from the Live API, which
        knows\\nnothing about retractions, and then injecting the data. So pulling
        out\\njust the entries that have retractions means building a separate index\\nof
        all items with retractions, then fetching these, and paging through\\nthem
        with the user\\\\'s requests. This gets to be HORRIBLY slow on the\\nperformance
        front with even not much load, and I don\\\\'t recommend it. We\\ntried several
        ways of implementing this but to no avail. So, for now,\\nplease download
        and parse the CSV if you want a full list of\\nretractions. We\\\\'ll continue
        to work on an API solution, but it\\\\'s going\\nto take us a bit longer.
        In the meantime, publishers: please continue to\\ndeposit retractions. It\\\\'s
        really important and we need to end the\\nculture of \\\\_shame\\\\_ (at least
        for publishers) around declaring\\nretractions. It is vital for the progress
        of science that we accurately\\nmark papers that have been shown to be defective.
        The other important\\nthing to note about all this is that, with any luck,
        it will help to\\nmake Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say \\\\[in
        their\\nannouncement\\\\](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/):\\n\\\\\\\"That
        means we have achieved sustainability -- the highest priority\\ngoal for any

        fee provides important unrestricted reserves that allow\\nfor breathing room
        and the potential for growth.\\\\\\\" It\\\\'s really great\\nthat Crossref

        find that this is true. For my institution, it works okay if the content is
        in one of our subscribed databases on ebscohost but it does not seem to know
        about holdings on other platforms.\_</p><p>This fits, given that while we
        used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery services), we have since moved to Alma/Primo
        and no longer have our holdings in the Ebsco systems. But presumably Ebsco
        still knows what Ebsco databases we have and the holding in those.</p><p>\_</p><h2
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">GetFTR plugin</h2><p>GetFTR is something I
        have written about in the past for example <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here
        </a>and <a href=\\\"https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html\\\">here\_</a>\_but
        here's a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.</p><p>If
        you look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library or even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain a listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron (for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.</p><p>GetFTR turns this
        on it's head, and instead the publisher/content owners maintain the list of
        holdings.</p><p>Roughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves</p><p>1. System
        authenticates to confirm which institution you are from (technically this
        can happen later as well)</p><p>2. System then determines from the DOI which
        publisher has that article and queries that publisher asking if the user's
        institution allows access to the article</p><p>3. The publisher (which hopefully
        supports GetFTR) will respond with a yes/no and a link to the full-text</p><p>4.
        Profit!</p><p>The issue here is for the whole GetFTR to get off the ground
        at step 1, it needs to be done on a discovery platform that supports GetFTR
        and currently there are not that many of those (e.g.\_\_<a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr\\\">One
        platform that supports GetFTR checks is ResearchGate</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2020/03/dimensions-and-papers-are-among-first-scholarly-platforms-to-join-new-service-get-full-text-research/\\\">Dimensions
        & Papers</a>).\_</p><p>One way around the problem is to install <a href=\\\"https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension\\\">the
        GetFTR browser extension</a> that will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to
        do the checks as you browse across the web!\_</p><p>This is a very new beta
        browser extension made available June 2023, so this is a preliminary look!</p><p><br
        /></p><p>Installing the browser plugin will get you the usual popup asking
        you to add your institution. I was half expecting my institution not to appear
        on the list because we do not do federated access generally for access to
        electronic resources and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work with
        any authentication method, they are most closely associated with using Seamless
        Access.\_</p><p>Instead, I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear,
        even ones that don't do OpenAthens etc.</p><div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear:

        fits, given that while we used to once have EDS (Ebsco discovery\\nservices),
        we have since moved to Alma/Primo and no longer have our\\nholdings in the

        have and the holding in those.\\n\\n\_\\n\\n## GetFTR plugin {#getftr-plugin
        style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"}\\n\\nGetFTR is something I have written about
        in the past for example\\n[here](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\\nand\\n[here\_](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2020/08/improving-access-and-delivery-of.html)\_but\\nhere\\\\'s
        a perhaps overly simplified way of explaining it is as follows.\\n\\nIf you
        look at the various solutions whether Libkey Nomad, Lean Library\\nor even
        link resolvers in general, the library either needs to maintain\\na listing
        of holdings or provide that to third parties like Third Iron\\n(for Libkey)
        , Sage (for Lean Library) for the system to work.\\n\\nGetFTR turns this on
        it\\\\'s head, and instead the publisher/content\\nowners maintain the list
        of holdings.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the GetFTR workflow involves\\n\\n1\\\\.
        System authenticates to confirm which institution you are from\\n(technically
        this can happen later as well)\\n\\n2\\\\. System then determines from the
        DOI which publisher has that article\\nand queries that publisher asking if
        the user\\\\'s institution allows\\naccess to the article\\n\\n3\\\\. The
        publisher (which hopefully supports GetFTR) will respond with a\\nyes/no and
        a link to the full-text\\n\\n4\\\\. Profit!\\n\\nThe issue here is for the
        whole GetFTR to get off the ground at step 1,\\nit needs to be done on a discovery
        platform that supports GetFTR and\\ncurrently there are not that many of those
        (e.g.\_\_[One platform that\\nsupports GetFTR checks is\\nResearchGate](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/researchgate-integrates-with-getftr),\\nalso

        way around the problem is to install [the GetFTR browser\\nextension](https://www.getfulltextresearch.com/chrome-browser-extension)\\nthat
        will act as a GetFTR enabled platform to do the checks as you\\nbrowse across
        the web!\_\\n\\nThis is a very new beta browser extension made available June

        plugin will get you the usual popup asking you to\\nadd your institution.
        I was half expecting my institution not to appear\\non the list because we
        do not do federated access generally for access\\nto electronic resources
        and I understand while GetFTR in theory can work\\nwith any authentication
        method, they are most closely associated with\\nusing Seamless Access.\_\\n\\nInstead,
        I noticed all the Singapore institutions do appear, even ones\\nthat don\\\\'t
        do OpenAthens etc.\\n\\n::: {.separator style=\\\"clear: both; text-align:

        Google Scholar\\nand PubMed. They also work on Two popular academic discovery
        services -\\nSummon and EDS (but not Primo it seems), Web of Science and the

        yet another wrinkle this time relating to registering dois\\nfor book content

        \ \\n\\nWhat type of buttons will the GetFTR browser extension produce?\\n\\nAll
        buttons produced I believe will have the same icon and label \\\\\\\"View\\nPDF\\\\\\\",

        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to

        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?

        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a

        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered

        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as &#8220;Research
        Access 21 (RA21)&#8221;, &#8220;Seamless Access&#8221;, or &#8220;Get Full
        Text Research (GetFTR)&#8221;, they want to replace the authentication options
        previously supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range
        activation, VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third
        parties, as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1]
        For years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that
        it will undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody
        Hanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, &#8220;that
        publishers don&#8217;t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.&#8221;
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it&#8217;s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech&#8217;s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Facebook code was also represented
        in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which means that
        patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the information
        behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers involve
        both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large data
        collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out and
        can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the person.
        A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every scientist
        is created; the previous special milieu of science communication has been
        incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance of
        the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure

        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of
        this? First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights:
        liberal societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their
        constitutions, but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we
        knew it has come to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming,
        because tracking can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all,
        in recent years we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble
        even in countries where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one
        country you don&#8217;t make friends with research on climate change,[3] in
        another not with gender studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University
        was chased out of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course,
        much easier when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles
        are tradable, they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as
        they want to spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences
        are also foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition
        to the detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore
        do not track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research
        investments. In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and
        material sciences, there is strong competition between public and commercial
        research, whereby the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented
        and disseminated the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata
        makes itself felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance:
        if you know who contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence,
        you don&#8217;t have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it&#8217;s all
        there in plain sight anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you
        no longer need to break into their lab, because you know what they are&nbsp;
        working on and how far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just
        one researcher who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together
        in business intelligence &#8211; who will be faster in filing a patent application?
        And will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke &#8220;Come to the dark side, we have cookies&#8221;?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you&#8217;ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group&#8217;s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><img

        on the ScienceDirect-platform&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn&#8217;t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what is
        the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the &#8220;right&#8221; one and how much it &#8220;counts&#8221;[12] but
        rather the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals
        seem like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses &#8220;the best invention since sliced bread&#8221;[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn&#8217;t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] &#8211; so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div
        class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter\\\"><img src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gF6hWhzNB3Se9ktkzfDeyUxTJ1vCOeLcdfhT3b1vSZmk4zOoBtUf1DUsuWW2-glKiJ4apciOnHH1zhMMSgKXtM_HFfczZtb8_vGwfRbqyltjYK-ACO-bRvgCpVX8q-bUAguQVtgk\\\"

        detaining a suspect&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        for some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like&nbsp; U.S. Immigration and Customs
        Enforcement (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both
        publishers are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore
        not at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all &#8211; and at the same time continue to escalate the path
        taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir&#8217;s
        analytics tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just
        as the data they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don&#8217;t
        have to be the only ones they&#8217;re used against &#8211; the respective
        interested parties can surely think of something \u2013 and library money
        is supporting these systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door
        deals between (semi-)state and commercial actors is emerging, where security
        institutions can get whatever they want to know on the market without having
        to rely any longer on onerous rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial
        search warrant. The motto of a data broker applies, who, when asked who was
        actually exchanging data with whom, replied: &#8220;Everyone with everyone.
        It&#8217;s one[2]&nbsp; big whorehouse.&#8221;[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where
        do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation of
        the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of platform
        economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this principle
        and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their work
        on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        &#8220;infrastructural turn&#8221;,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research &#8211; which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So parts of
        the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie&#8217;s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana
        Zuboff&#8217;s analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that
        science and antiscience[31] are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing
        tangle, because in the same way that this system could not be operated at
        all without a developed scientific education, it is at the same time laying
        the axe to the foundations of truth, enlightenment and social liberties. In
        discourse, this becomes clear in the meteoric rise of half-truths, which are
        used by conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic players, as well as the
        media &#8211; and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently
        developed this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Science
        Fictions&#8221; as a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards unreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront of
        attention.[32] Not from the perspective of an economist, but of a literary
        scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that no longer operates
        according to the scheme true/false, but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible,
        affective/sober, and connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal
        coherence and no longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,
        could no longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check,
        which highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all &#8211; when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they&#8217;re corrupting the truth, they&#8217;re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote
        class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\"><p>&#8220;When people start routinely accepting
        that The System is Broken and The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things
        tend to happen. It&#8217;s very hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning
        society once everyone believes (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system
        is the only way to get by.&#8221;[36]</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming the
        system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that&#8217;s exactly why GitHub exists &#8211; and a
        trusted, powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science
        needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And before I forget &#8211; there is one more thing

        Siems</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n:::\\n\\nIn December 2018, a University of
        Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson,\\nparticipated in a workshop hosted
        by the [Coalition for Networked\\nInformation](https://www.cni.org/). The
        topic of this, and a number of\\nother events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more\\nfully integrate authentication systems for
        accessing electronic media\\ninto their platforms. Under various labels such
        as \\\"Research Access 21\\n(RA21)\\\", \\\"Seamless Access\\\", or \\\"Get
        Full Text Research (GetFTR)\\\", they\\nwant to replace the authentication
        options previously supported by\\nlibraries and academic institutions, such
        as IP range activation, VPN,\\nproxy servers, or anonymous authentication
        to neutral third parties, as\\nwith the Shibboleth service, in favor of their
        own initiatives.\\\\[1\\\\] For\\nyears, librarians have countered these moves
        with their concerns that it\\nwill undermine the privacy of their users. Even
        at the event where Cody\\nHanson sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter
        of the National\\nInformation Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first
        correctly\\nnoting that RA21 does not require personally identifiable information\\n(PII)
        to be sent to the publisher for authentication to occur. In fact,\\nservices
        like RA21 and Shibboleth share the same technical basis of a\\nsingle sign-on
        via the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) -- it's\\njust that the
        technical realization is different. But then, to calm the\\ndiscussion, Carpenter
        added, \\\"that publishers don't need PII from RA21\\nto be able to identify
        library users.\\\" And that statement, of course,\\nwas absolutely designed
        to allay any concerns.\\n\\nCody Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing
        privacy-compliant access\\nto electronic media for his users, began to wonder.
        Should this be true\\nand can an analysis of the source code of publisher
        platform pages\\nprovide evidence of if and how publishers can identify library
        users?\\nCody Hanson undertook a testing exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded\\ndocuments
        at his university and looked at them to see which platforms\\nwere represented
        in them. He picked one document from each of the\\nfifteen platforms found,
        examined it with the Ghostery browser addon,\\nand downloaded the document
        page to examine the source code. Several\\nthousand lines of JavaScript later,
        Cody Hanson came to a simple answer:\\nyes, it's true, Carpenter was right.\\n\\nOf
        the fifteen platforms examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on\\nthe
        others, he found a total of 139 different third-party asset sources.\\nAdTech's
        entire technical assortment was represented: simple trackers,\\naudience tools
        like Neustar, AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and\\nfingerprinters like Doubleclick.
        These finds were significant to Cody\\nHanson:\\n\\n\\\"The reason I was interested
        in third-party assets being loaded on these\\nsites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the\\nentire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address\\nand contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that\\nhappens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from\\nadditional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts
        JavaScript\\nfrom Google on its pages, Google can record any information from
        the\\npage about the article being sought, or search terms from a library
        user\\nin the publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms\\nincluded
        Google code on the article page.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nFacebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of\\nother data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a\\ngiven. Personalized profiles of
        the information behavior of every\\nscientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large\\nInternet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors,\\nthe data does not remain with the publishers, but flows
        out and can be\\nlinked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about
        the\\nperson. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of\\nevery
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science\\ncommunication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and\\ngovernmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.\\n\\n## Researchers at risk\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jTLXe--K5Pdeovdnkfyld5L7AODrPm-aJH7MESiQ25_Tn06oY7zx7LRcSZiRl-c7PnDA8_c9u4vpQT7aYKg4MHd4iQZsGhUMXDHqKlsZ9dRGgi6oM2zHHWC_3eoHEYbOOGrvCecx\\\"

        are the consequences of this? First, it must be noted that this is\\na violation
        of fundamental rights: liberal societies have freedom of\\nresearch and teaching
        enshrined in their constitutions, but a monitored\\nfreedom is not. Thus,
        academic freedom as we knew it has come to its\\nend. But this is not merely
        an abstract shortcoming, because tracking\\ncan put scientists at concrete
        and grave risk. After all, in recent\\nyears we have seen that, as a researcher,
        you can get into trouble even\\nin countries where you would not have suspected
        it in the past: in one\\ncountry you don't make friends with research on climate
        change,\\\\[3\\\\] in\\nanother not with gender studies.\\\\[4\\\\] And in
        Hungary, the Central\\nEuropean University was chased out of the country.\\\\[5\\\\]
        Putting pressure\\non scientists is, of course, much easier when you know
        more about them,\\nand since their behavioral profiles are tradable, they
        are of course\\nopen to all interested actors, as long as they want to spend
        the\\nnecessary money.\\n\\nEconomic consequences are also foreseeable, be
        it either in the form of\\na distortion of competition to the detriment of
        publishers who act in a\\ntrustworthy manner and therefore do not track, or,
        above all, in the\\ndestruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future\\nfields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there\\nis strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby\\nthe
        commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and\\ndisseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata\\nmakes itself
        felt in tracking as it does in telecommunication\\nsurveillance: if you know
        who contacted each other, when, how often, and\\nin what sequence, you don't
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore,\\nit's all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being\\ntracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know\\nwhat they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And\\nsince it's not just one researcher who
        is being tracked and all the data\\ncan be analyzed together in business intelligence
        -- who will be faster\\nin filing a patent application? And will research
        results still benefit\\nthe public that paid for them?\\n\\nSo is it time
        to update the old joke \\\"Come to the dark side, we have\\ncookies\\\"? Absolutely.
        And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are\\ngoing to put a stop to
        third-party tracking, can we sit back because it\\nwill all have been an ugly
        transitional phase? Not at all. All the\\ninterested players are either busy
        monopolizing data access for\\nthemselves, like Google, or continuing to find
        ways for themselves, like\\nothers. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are\\nyou'll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your\\ninformation behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to\\nset a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.\\\\[6\\\\]\\nElsevier,
        as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the\\ngroup's Risk
        Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its\\nScienceDirect platform,
        a technology that boasts of being able to\\nindividually identify billions
        of devices and, if you recall the\\ndiscussion about ebay, does not shy away
        from port scanning.\\\\[7\\\\]\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\">\\n<img\\nsrc=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NWFRpQPxHxeJXmt-jKeWDG55gh7uOY3YfoqlYwgiGOn7GdJjcexcpqfN1vPinaplTYybJXANPYLW3iMCzfYL5NznhX82AdLJLbnZAVfEBytsnrhQhqjG0CiDWxVpr54_3q7r1AVW\\\"

        the ScienceDirect-platform\_\\n\\nThe argument about authentication is also
        far from over\\\\[8\\\\], and\\npublishers sometimes use sleazy methods to
        enforce their wishes. In\\n2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out
        deadlines for switching\\nto seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown,
        and those who\\ndidn't keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to\\nnew access rules.\\\\[9\\\\] Using the same instrument over the
        Christmas\\nholidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation\\nof
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows\\ninformation
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The\\ngoal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because\\nthis is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are\\nhardly accepted there;
        currently Elsevier and SpringerNature are\\nconsidering infiltrating Trojans
        into university networks via the\\nlibraries in order to be able to collect
        biometric data such as typing\\nspeed or types of mouse movement in order
        to be able to identify users\\nin other areas of the Internet as well.\\\\[10\\\\]\\n\\nSo
        what is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they\\nwant
        to expand their unassailable position in information access to the\\nentire
        research life cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those\\nconcluded
        by Elsevier in the Netherlands, under which researchers can\\npublish open
        access at no extra cost if the universities license\\nElsevier products in
        the area of research information systems in\\nreturn.\\\\[11\\\\] Such contracts
        are disastrous, because it will be\\nimmediately clear to all researchers
        that their research will only be\\nproperly noted in the next evaluation if
        it also ends up in the\\nappropriate journals. Consequently, the market for
        both publication and\\nresearch information systems will quickly clear up
        as a result of this\\nlinkage business, and then the platform will have moved
        a step closer to\\nits goal again: namely, that it is not science, universities
        or research\\nfunders who determine which research is the \\\"right\\\" one
        and how much it\\n\\\"counts\\\"\\\\[12\\\\] but rather the platform who makes
        the determination.\\n\\nSuch deals seem like revenants from the nineties,
        when, in the [browser\\nwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)
        Microsoft knocked\\nNetscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows.\\nAnother revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if
        libraries\\nhad dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing\\npublishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making\\nself archiving
        worthless by signing up for package licenses\\\\[13\\\\] (which\\nis why the
        head of SpringerNature called package licenses \\\"the best\\ninvention since
        sliced bread\\\"\\\\[14\\\\]), now they are once again holding\\nout for publishers,
        where publishers are having their Napster moment\\nthrough SciHub. By partnering
        with publishers to commercialize open\\naccess through publication fees, libraries
        are trying to crisis-proof\\ntheir business: as long as science governance
        doesn't change, scientists\\nwill have to publish in the appropriate journals,
        and libraries will\\nprevail precisely in the area of accounting and managing
        publication\\ncosts so they can continue to justify their staff and budgets.
        As a\\nresult, publication fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in\\nsome
        cases\\\\[15\\\\] -- so there is always enough money with the publishers\\nto
        continue to outspend, out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any\\nalternatives
        that are developed from within the scientific community.\\nAnd, moreover,
        DEAL contracts in Germany are already beginning to\\ndistort competition from
        publishers in favor of the big players on whom\\nthe negotiations are focused
        -- adding even more more money to even\\nfewer players.\\\\[16\\\\]\\n\\n##

        scholarly communication, this is no longer\\nenough. Thomson Reuters and RELX
        have discovered the global security\\nindustry as a buyer of their data analytics
        products, and have signed\\nbig data policing contracts with law enforcement
        organizations like\_\\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that
        use these tools to\\ntrack immigrants.\\\\[17\\\\] Since both publishers are
        central providers of\\nspecialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the\\nmoment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or\\nLexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby\\ncontributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.\\\\[18\\\\] The\\npublishers,
        of course, dismiss it all -- and at the same time continue\\nto escalate the
        path taken: RELX was also an early investor in Palantir,\\nand so the information
        provided by LexisNexis can also be imported and\\nanalyzed in Palantir's analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and\\ntools are sold globally just as the
        data they feed is collected\\nglobally, illegal immigrants don't have to be
        the only ones they're used\\nagainst -- the respective interested parties
        can surely think of\\nsomething -- and library money is supporting these systems
        of\\nsurveillance.\\\\[19\\\\] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state\\nand
        commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get\\nwhatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any\\nlonger on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search\\nwarrant. The motto of
        a data broker applies, who, when asked who was\\nactually exchanging data
        with whom, replied: \\\"Everyone with everyone.\\nIt's one\\\\[2\\\\]\_ big
        whorehouse.\\\"\\\\[20\\\\]\\n\\nSo where do we stand? We have seen in the
        past that, due to the special\\nsituation of the Cold War, the major scientific
        publishers grew into an\\nearly form of platform economy, long before the
        large Internet\\ncorporations adapted this principle and were thus able to
        achieve their\\ncurrent position.\\\\[21\\\\] With their work on the Trojans,
        the publishers\\nare also revealing geopolitical interests, namely to cut
        off entire\\nstates from the flow of scientific information, and are thus
        part of a\\nCold War 4.0.\\\\[22\\\\] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with\\nscientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also
        had to\\nrecognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their
        actual\\npurpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has
        been\\nanalyzed time and again in the past\\\\[23\\\\], but only now, through
        the\\nreplication crisis and every glance at [Retraction\\nWatch](https://retractionwatch.com/),
        is it becoming clear how the\\ncompulsion for storytelling, the fudging of
        data, and the fight for the\\nsmallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from\\nwithin. Leading players in science communication
        will have no problem\\nwith this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen
        journals in the past\\nthat claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells
        rented out to\\npharmaceutical companies to be filled.\\\\[24\\\\] And the
        parent company RELX\\nengages in political landscaping with donations to climate
        change\\ndeniers and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.\\\\[25\\\\]\\nAll
        this can only happen almost without contradiction because\\ninfrastructure
        is still a largely blind spot in science governance. More\\nand more voices
        are calling for an \\\"infrastructural turn\\\",\\\\[26\\\\] but\\neven in
        the welcome European initiatives the old mistakes are being\\nmade, because
        in the European Open Science Cloud Elsevier has\\nnested\\\\[27\\\\] just
        as ORE is run by F1000 Research -- which has been\\nbought up by Taylor &
        Francis.\\\\[28\\\\]\\n\\nSo parts of the scientific information infrastructures
        are increasingly\\nmoving toward the dark money complex, as characterized
        by the Koch\\nbrothers, or even by Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge\\nAnalytica
        possible. If you read Christopher Wylie's report on this\\\\[29\\\\]\\nand
        compare it with Shoshana Zuboff's analysis of surveillance\\ncapitalism\\\\[30\\\\],
        you will see that science and antiscience\\\\[31\\\\] are\\nincreasingly amalgamating
        into a confusing tangle, because in the same\\nway that this system could
        not be operated at all without a developed\\nscientific education, it is at
        the same time laying the axe to the\\nfoundations of truth, enlightenment
        and social liberties. In discourse,\\nthis becomes clear in the meteoric rise
        of half-truths, which are used\\nby conspiracy theorists, politicians, economic
        players, as well as the\\nmedia -- and more and more scientific authors. J\xF6rg
        Peters recently\\ndeveloped this in his discussion of Stuart Ritchie's \\\"Science
        Fictions\\\"\\nas a structural problem of an information infrastructure that
        rewards\\nunreplicable research results and flushes them to the forefront
        of\\nattention.\\\\[32\\\\] Not from the perspective of an economist, but
        of a\\nliterary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths as a technique that\\nno
        longer operates according to the scheme true/false, but according to\\nschemes
        such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and\\nconnective/closed. What
        is central, she says, is internal coherence and\\nno longer correspondence
        with external facts. Half-truths, therefore,\\ncould no longer be resolved
        with a fact check, but only with a fiction\\ncheck, which highlights how the
        half-truth builds a narrative around a\\ncrystallization core of truth while
        pretending to report facts.\\\\[33\\\\] We\\nfind much of this in the corrupted
        information infrastructures, such as\\nthe impossibility for the reviewer
        to follow documents of a 21st century\\ndata-driven science to the ground
        of fact within a 17th century\\npublication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on\\ncredibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently\\nexposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same
        justification\\nphrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist
        Claas\\nRelotius.\\\\[34\\\\]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAfter all -- when we
        talk about power and power abuse in academia, the\\ninformation infrastructures
        must not be forgotten. They are in your lab,\\nthey are in your life, they're
        corrupting the truth, they're selling\\nyour ass and there is little you can
        do about it.\\\\[35\\\\] Nevertheless, it\\nremains the responsibility of
        each individual to reflect on this for\\ntheir actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal\\nYarkoni states in his great rant:\\n\\n>
        \\\"When people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and\\n>
        The Incentives Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It's\\n> very
        hard to have a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone\\n> believes
        (rightly or wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way\\n> to get by.\\\"\\\\[36\\\\]\\n\\nGaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins.\\nActing
        responsibly, on the other hand, means supporting and improving\\nexisting
        European initiatives. In Germany, this is currently being done,\\namong other
        things, through the National Research Data Infrastructure\\n(NFDI), which
        is cooperative and public. This path must be expanded, and\\nthe mistakes
        from the literature supply must be avoided at all costs.\\nScience will never
        be happy again as long as the big players remain in\\nthe game. The success
        of the NFDI is all the more crucial because in the\\ndata-driven sciences,
        data, software and text belong in a common context\\nso that results can be
        verified and immediately developed further. For\\nscientists, the current
        situation is like when a programmer first writes\\nhis code, then publishes
        an article about it, and the next programmer\\ntries to guess the code from
        the article and then creates an improved\\nversion. Sounds highly efficient?
        And that's exactly why GitHub exists\\n-- and a trusted, powerful and non-buyable

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch&#8217;s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [&#8230;] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors&#8217; will.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t
        know what&#8217;s going on here. I agree with O&#8217;Connor that &#8220;It\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)&#8221;. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That&#8217;s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there&#8217;s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler&#8217;s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of &#8220;false crocodiles&#8221; Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments &#8220;The retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"><img

        this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from those
        more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I can&#8217;t
        help but suspect that something is going on here that&#8217;s not being clearly
        stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is itself controversial,
        due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime? Is it even possible
        that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em> colluded
        in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else? I don&#8217;t
        know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone of anything).
        But I do know that <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s vague and possibly misleading retraction
        notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency that we aim
        to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we don&#8217;t

        in [Retraction Watch's\\naccount](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/):\\ncorresponding
        author Jingmai O'Connor told them:\\n\\n> I don't agree with the retraction
        but there is no point in fighting\\n> it, so we all signed it.\\n>\\n> I cannot
        say why *Nature* chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on\\n> their inner
        machinations. \\\\[...\\\\] It is also not that unusual for\\n> paleontologists
        to misidentify things and for new information to\\n> correct previous hypotheses.
        However, *Nature* chose not to publish\\n> the Matter's Arising and instead
        retracts our paper -- they must have\\n> their reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the\\n*authors* retracted
        the original paper --- yet the corresponding author\\nsays that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors' will.\\n\\nI don't know what's going
        on here. I agree with O'Connor that \\\"It's\\nunfortunate because this way
        science can't simply correct itself (as it\\nis supposed to do)\\\". If, as
        Li et al. (2000) argue, *Oculudentavis* is\\nactually a squamate (lizard),
        well, fine: they can publish their\\nconclusion, and the community will arrive
        at a consensus as to which\\nidentification is correct. That's how it works,
        right? So why the\\nretraction?\\n\\nAnd there's more: what does this mean
        for zoological nomenclature? Is\\nthe name *Oculudentavis khaungraae* still
        nomenclaturally valid?\\nOpinions on this seem to vary (see [the Dinosaur
        Mailing List thread\\nbeginning with Ben Creisler's announcement of the\\nretraction](http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156).)\\n\\nI
        lean to the interpretation that, since the [International Code on\\nZoological\\nNomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/)\\ndoes
        not mention retractions, it implicitly takes the position that a\\npaper once
        published is published forever. On that basis, the name\\n*Oculudentavis*
        remains valid and attached to the holoype specimen ---\\neven if that name,
        with its *-avis* suffix, proves to have been poorly\\nchosen in pertaining
        to a non-bird. (After all, there is plenty of\\nprecedent for misleading names
        staying in place: the whale\\n*Basilosaurus* is not a saurian, and the clade
        of \\\"false crocodiles\\\"\\nPseudosuchia includes the true crocodiles.)\\n\\nThis
        doesn't seem to be what Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook\\nexchange forwarded
        to me by a friend who I will leave anonymous unless\\nhe or she chooses to
        out him or herself, Henry Gee comments \\\"The\\nretraction means the paper
        is erased from the record, and this includes\\nthe name\\\".\\n\\n[![](https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png){.alignnone\\n.size-full

        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly &#8220;suppressed&#8221;   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this &#8220;suppression&#8221;
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        &#8220;anomalous citation patterns&#8221; but without much further detail
        given for each of the journals other than the overall &#8220;% Self-cites&#8221;
        of the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate&#8217;s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>

        read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from both
        of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (&#8220;self-citation&#8221; at the journal-level
        from Clarivate&#8217;s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important &#8216;megajournal&#8217; for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate&#8217;s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called &#8216;<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>&#8216; indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        &#8216;high&#8217; journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual&#8217;s research output. In some regimes, if
        a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it &#8216;counts&#8217;, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not &#8216;count&#8217; towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate&#8217;s wacky &#8220;suppression&#8221; might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate&#8217;s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please &#8220;suppress&#8221; all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"On

        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 to
        assess the quality of an individual's research output. In\\nsome regimes,
        if a researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a\\nJournal Impact
        Factor \u2122 then it 'counts', whereas if a researcher\\npublishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official\\nJournal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not 'count'\\ntowards the assessment of that
        researcher.\\n\\nThe [zoology section of the Chilean Society of\\nBiology](https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001)\\nhas
        already petitioned Clarivate to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back\\nits
        Journal Impact Factor \u2122 . I understand why they would do this but I\\nwould
        actually call for something quite different and more far-reaching.\\n\\nI
        would encourage all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists,\\nmicrobiologists,
        and biologists in general to see the real problem here:\\nClarivate, a for-profit
        analytics company, should never be so\\nrelied-upon by research evaluation
        committees to arbitrarily decide the\\nvalue of a research output. Especially
        given that the Journal Impact\\nFactor \u2122 is untransparent,\\n[irreproducible](https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036),
        and\\nfundamentally [statistically\\nilliterate](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/).\\n\\nThus
        to bring us back to my title. I wonder if Clarivate's wacky\\n\\\"suppression\\\"
        might actually be a pathway to liberation from the\\ninappropriate stupidity
        of using Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to evaluate\\nindividual research outputs.
        Given we have all now witnessed just how\\nbrainless some of Clarivate's decision
        making is, I would ask Clarivate\\nto please \\\"suppress\\\" all journals
        thereby removing the harmful stupidity\\nof Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from
        the lives of researchers.\\n\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"guid\":\"http://rossmounce.co.uk/?p=2199\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593777776,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On
