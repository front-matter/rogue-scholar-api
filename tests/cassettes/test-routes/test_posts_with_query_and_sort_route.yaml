        is that <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9\\\">Crossref has acquired
        the Retraction Watch database of expressions of concerns and retractions and
        has made it openly accessible to anyone who wants to use it</a>. I\u2019m
        waiting for full confirmation of the license or public domain dedication under
        which it will be released, but this is still a great commitment of Crossref
        to the POSI principles. The liberation of this database is good for science
        and scholarship in general. It means that Crossref now knows about approximately
        50,000 retractions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Access to the database, for now, is via the
        Crossref Labs API, which I write and maintain. The Crossref Labs API sits
        in between the user and the Live API to inject new experimental metadata fields.
        The API can also serve files, so you can get the CSV of the latest Retraction
        Watch data at https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile,
        the Labs API will show you retraction data in the cr-labs-updates entry if
        you visit a work that has data, e.g. https://api.labs.crossref.org/works/10.2147/CMAR.S324920?mailto=[YOUR@EMAIL.HERE].</p>\\n\\n<p>The
        obvious question (and one that <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gcabanac/status/1701594642142363877\\\">was
        asked within an hour of our launch</a>) is: how can I retrieve a list of all
        retractions via the API? This is what we call a \u201Cfilter\u201D in the
        API and, for Reasons\u2122, it is very difficult to do in the Labs API. The
        Reasons\xAE that it\u2019s so difficult is because the Labs API gets its data
        by pulling from the Live API, which knows nothing about retractions, and then
        injecting the data. So pulling out just the entries that have retractions
        means building a separate index of all items with retractions, then fetching
        these, and paging through them with the user\u2019s requests. This gets to
        be HORRIBLY slow on the performance front with even not much load, and I don\u2019t
        recommend it. We tried several ways of implementing this but to no avail.
        So, for now, please download and parse the CSV if you want a full list of
        retractions. We\u2019ll continue to work on an API solution, but it\u2019s
        going to take us a bit longer.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, publishers: please
        continue to deposit retractions. It\u2019s really important and we need to
        end the culture of <em>shame</em> (at least for publishers) around declaring
        retractions. It is vital for the progress of science that we accurately mark
        papers that have been shown to be defective.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other important
        thing to note about all this is that, with any luck, it will help to make
        Retraction Watch itself sustainable. As they say <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/\\\">in
        their announcement</a>: \u201CThat means we have achieved sustainability \u2013
        the highest priority goal for any nonprofit \u2013 for the database side of
        our operation. And the acquisition fee provides important unrestricted reserves
        that allow for breathing room and the potential for growth.\u201D It\u2019s
        really great that Crossref can contribute towards this sustainability, in
        the spirit of also improving the metadata that we can offer.</p>\\n\\n    <p><a

        up\_here!</a></p><p>Papermilling has a few definitions which you see here
        and there. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201Corganised manipulation of the peer-review
        process\u201D or it might be \u201Cmanufacturing of fraudulent research papers\u201D
        and so\_on.</p><p>I described the general roles involved in papermilling in
        <a href=\\\"https://publisherad.medium.com/how-papermills-work-generally-c080bb9fff43\\\">a
        previous blog\_post</a>.</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*OSsajzQlkOFyf_LkQ6lBfw.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>But there\u2019s actually a lot of nuance in how different papermills
        operate. Consider what happens when we have multiple agents, forgers and authors
        operating in a\_network.</p><p>I\u2019m going to describe here 3 quite different
        things which get called \u2018paper mills\u2019. Perhaps there are more than
        3 main classes of papermill? Add a comment if you can think of another\_one!</p><h3>1.
        Fabrication from\_scratch</h3><p>Any organisation which fabricates research
        papers from scratch for sale. People have been fabricating research for as
        long as research has been a thing, but it\u2019s the <em>organised</em> part
        that makes this new. This happens at a vastly greater scale than it used to
        and the problem continues to\_grow.</p><p>There are definitely templates and
        re-used images and text in these papers, but I think \u2018from scratch\u2019
        is a fair distinction between this and the other\_types.</p><p>All those fake
        western blots? That\u2019s this. Those cancer genetics papers from obscure
        hospital research departments? That\u2019s this too. Take a look at cases
        highlighted by Jennifer Byrne, Elisabeth Bik, Cheshire, Smut Clyde and others
        for examples.</p><p>My <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/719b8b3b8253\\\">Papermill
        Alarm API</a>, mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/p/b89db7feba9d\\\">previous
        blog posts</a>, is mostly trained to highlight this kind of papermilling.</p><h3>2.
        Fabrication by plagiarism</h3><p>Fabrication from scratch requires skill.
        What if our forger doesn\u2019t know how to write a fake paper from scratch?
        This is a <em>sad\_forger:</em></p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/250/1*7_PceWGAeLBoczc3dYi2Jg.png\\\"
        /><figcaption>I\u2019ve made him look sad by rotating his mouth 180\xB0. Image
        manipulation is not my\_fort\xE9.</figcaption></figure><p>So what can he do?
        How can he turn that frown upside-down?</p><figure><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/363/1*0b31C3OWhZwrtkz9C3Cfww.png\\\"
        /></figure><p>The idea is simple. If he can\u2019t write a fake paper, <em>he
        can just copy a real one</em>! Or he can get creative and copy several bits
        of papers and paste the bits into a new manuscript. If he\u2019s worried about
        getting caught by anti-plagiarism software, he can always drop the text into
        a paraphrasing tool. This is where we get \u201CTortured Phrases\u201D (<a
        href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06751\\\">see the great work of Guillaume
        Cabanac et al on this subject</a>).</p><p>The difference between organised
        plagiarism and papermilling-from-scratch is simply that, here, the forger
        starts with 1 or more existing papers and <em>converts </em>them into a \u2018new\u2019\_one.</p><h3>3.
        Authorship brokering</h3><p>This is where authorship slots on papers, fabricated
        or not, are sold. This is actually just the \u2018agent\u2019 part of any
        papermilling operation, but sometimes we see it as a standalone service.</p><p><a
        href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/18/exclusive-russian-site-says-it-has-brokered-authorships-for-more-than-10000-researchers/\\\">A
        famous case of a brokerage advertising authorships for sale was brought to
        light by Retraction Watch some years ago</a>. Anna Abalkina, a researcher
        at Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13322\\\">investigated
        this matter by tracking down the papers advertised on that site</a>. It\u2019s
        a very interesting case and well-worth reading\_about.</p><p>It\u2019s fortunate
        that the papers for sale on that site were advertised so openly. Consider
        now that anyone can sell authorship on any paper privately. How can we detect
        that? I\u2019ve learned recently that it might be possible to spot these brokered
        authorships.</p><h3>Join me at ConTech\_Live!</h3><p>Earlier this year, SAGE
        Publishing worked with <a href=\\\"https://opencredo.com/\\\">Open Credo</a>,

        on this blog was published on August 3, 2007 (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1q\\\">Open
        access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</a>). This is post number
        465, and in the past 15 years the blog has seen changes in technology and
        hosting location \u2013 but I wrote all posts (with the exception of a few
        guest posts). The overall theme remained unchanged: technology used in scholarly
        communication. </p><p>Instead of a detailed analysis of recurring themes,
        or how scholarly communication has changed in the last 15 years, I want to
        pick one topic that continues to worry me, and has been the subject of multiple
        posts on this blog and elsewhere: the over-reliance on PDF as publishing format
        for scholarly articles.</p><p>This week I read two interesting articles related
        to climate change. One of them (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01426-1\\\">Over
        half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change</a>)
        did an impressive systematic review of the literature on the impacts of ten
        climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions on each known human
        pathogenic disease (in short: very scary). The second paper (<a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120584119\\\">Estimating
        the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products</a>) tried to estimate the
        environmental impact of more than 50K food products in the United Kingdom

        have a significant environmental impact).</p><p>Both articles are available
        online as full-text, but they come in PDF format. Fine for printing and then
        reading them (which I did), but in 2022 I expect to read papers on a tablet
        (which I use for almost all my reading) where the PDF letter or A4 size doesn't
        quite fit on the 10-inch screen. There are other problems with PDF (e.g. access
        to metadata such as references and using PDF as submission format, e.g. with
        preprints). These problems are not new and there are workarounds, but in the
        15 years of writing this blog \u2013 despite a lot of progress \u2013 scholarly
        communication continues to have an uneasy relationship with technology and
        is often stuck in the past. In contrast to many (but of course not all) other
        sectors.</p><p>This means there are many reasons to continue writing this

        Siems</figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In December 2018, a University
        of Minnesota web librarian, Cody Hanson, participated in a workshop hosted
        by the <a href=\\\"https://www.cni.org/\\\">Coalition for Networked Information</a>.
        The topic of this, and a number of other events to date, is the drive by major
        scholarly publishers to more fully integrate authentication systems for accessing
        electronic media into their platforms. Under various labels such as \u201CResearch
        Access 21 (RA21)\u201D, \u201CSeamless Access\u201D, or \u201CGet Full Text
        Research (GetFTR)\u201D, they want to replace the authentication options previously
        supported by libraries and academic institutions, such as IP range activation,
        VPN, proxy servers, or anonymous authentication to neutral third parties,
        as with the Shibboleth service, in favor of their own initiatives.[1] For
        years, librarians have countered these moves with their concerns that it will
        undermine the privacy of their users. Even at the event where Cody Hanson
        sat, the discussion raged until Todd Carpenter of the National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) intervened, first correctly noting that RA21
        does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to be sent to the
        publisher for authentication to occur. In fact, services like RA21 and Shibboleth
        share the same technical basis of a single sign-on via the Security Assertion
        Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 it\u2019s just that the technical realization
        is different. But then, to calm the discussion, Carpenter added, \u201Cthat
        publishers don\u2019t need PII from RA21 to be able to identify library users.\u201D
        And that statement, of course, was absolutely designed to allay any concerns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cody
        Hanson, who spent a lot of time developing privacy-compliant access to electronic
        media for his users, began to wonder. Should this be true and can an analysis
        of the source code of publisher platform pages provide evidence of if and
        how publishers can identify library users? Cody Hanson undertook a testing
        exercise: he took the 100 most-demanded documents at his university and looked
        at them to see which platforms were represented in them. He picked one document
        from each of the fifteen platforms found, examined it with the Ghostery browser
        addon, and downloaded the document page to examine the source code. Several
        thousand lines of JavaScript later, Cody Hanson came to a simple answer: yes,
        it\u2019s true, Carpenter was right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the fifteen platforms
        examined, one was clean (InformPubsOnline); on the others, he found a total
        of 139 different third-party asset sources. AdTech\u2019s entire technical
        assortment was represented: simple trackers, audience tools like Neustar,
        AddThis, Adobe, and Oracle, and fingerprinters like Doubleclick. These finds
        were significant to Cody Hanson:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\u201CThe reason I was
        interested in third-party assets being loaded on these sites is that any JavaScript
        loaded on these pages has access to the entire DOM, or document object model,
        meaning it can read the address and contents of the page. It also has access
        to every user action that happens on that page, and can itself load additional
        scripts from additional sources. So when, for example, a publisher puts JavaScript
        from Google on its pages, Google can record any information from the page
        about the article being sought, or search terms from a library user in the
        publisher platform. Fourteen of the fifteen publisher platforms included Google
        code on the article page.\u201C[2]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Facebook code was also
        represented in many cases, as were a number of other data collectors, which
        means that patron privacy is no longer a given. Personalized profiles of the
        information behavior of every scientist are created, and since the publishers
        involve both the large Internet corporations and the audience tools as large
        data collectors, the data does not remain with the publishers, but flows out
        and can be linked with the knowledge that already exists elsewhere about the
        person. A seamless and thus valuable and tradable online biography of every
        scientist is created; the previous special milieu of science communication
        has been incorporated into the general commercial (and governmental) surveillance
        of the digital space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Researchers at
        risk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>:
        Screenshot of <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAzt-iJEkvU&amp;feature=youtu.be\\\">Cody
        Hanson\u2019s talk</a>\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the consequences of this?
        First, it must be noted that this is a violation of fundamental rights: liberal
        societies have freedom of research and teaching enshrined in their constitutions,
        but a monitored freedom is not. Thus, academic freedom as we knew it has come
        to its end. But this is not merely an abstract shortcoming, because tracking
        can put scientists at concrete and grave risk. After all, in recent years
        we have seen that, as a researcher, you can get into trouble even in countries
        where you would not have suspected it in the past: in one country you don\u2019t
        make friends with research on climate change,[3] in another not with gender
        studies.[4] And in Hungary, the Central European University was chased out
        of the country.[5] Putting pressure on scientists is, of course, much easier
        when you know more about them, and since their behavioral profiles are tradable,
        they are of course open to all interested actors, as long as they want to
        spend the necessary money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Economic consequences are also
        foreseeable, be it either in the form of a distortion of competition to the
        detriment of publishers who act in a trustworthy manner and therefore do not
        track, or, above all, in the destruction of the value of public research investments.
        In many future fields such as AI, personalized medicine, and material sciences,
        there is strong competition between public and commercial research, whereby
        the commercial players are in part also the ones who invented and disseminated
        the tracking technologies. Now, the same power of metadata makes itself felt
        in tracking as it does in telecommunication surveillance: if you know who
        contacted each other, when, how often, and in what sequence, you don\u2019t
        have to listen to the phone calls anymore, it\u2019s all there in plain sight
        anyway. Likewise, if researchers are being tracked, you no longer need to
        break into their lab, because you know what they are\_ working on and how
        far they have gotten with it. And since it\u2019s not just one researcher
        who is being tracked and all the data can be analyzed together in business
        intelligence \u2013 who will be faster in filing a patent application? And
        will research results still benefit the public that paid for them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So
        is it time to update the old joke \u201CCome to the dark side, we have cookies\u201D?
        Absolutely. And when we hear that Google, Apple and others are going to put
        a stop to third-party tracking, can we sit back because it will all have been
        an ugly transitional phase? Not at all. All the interested players are either
        busy monopolizing data access for themselves, like Google, or continuing to
        find ways for themselves, like others. If you take a closer look at your favorite
        journal, chances are you\u2019ll find tools for collecting Real Time Bidding
        Data, meaning your information behavior is auctioned off in real time without
        the need to set a cookie but e.g. for the benefit of intelligence services.[6]
        Elsevier, as part of RELX, benefits from technologies that reside in the group\u2019s
        Risk Solution division and has installed ThreatMetrix on its ScienceDirect
        platform, a technology that boasts of being able to individually identify
        billions of devices and, if you recall the discussion about ebay, does not
        shy away from port scanning.[7]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><figure></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Figure
        2</strong>: Traces of <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1295655040741445632\\\">ThreatMetrix</a>
        on the ScienceDirect-platform\_</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The argument about authentication
        is also far from over[8], and publishers sometimes use sleazy methods to enforce
        their wishes. In 2020, for example, libraries were given opt-out deadlines
        for switching to seamless access in the middle of the first lockdown, and
        those who didn\u2019t keep a constant eye on their email in this situation
        woke up to new access rules.[9] Using the same instrument over the Christmas
        holidays is also very popular, for example, to enforce the installation of
        Google CASA (Campus Activated Subscriber Access), which allows information
        behavior to be synchronized with the Google account. The goal is to always
        keep a hand on the valuable first-party data, because this is the best way
        to secure direct personalized access. Borders are hardly accepted there; currently
        Elsevier and SpringerNature are considering infiltrating Trojans into university
        networks via the libraries in order to be able to collect biometric data such
        as typing speed or types of mouse movement in order to be able to identify
        users in other areas of the Internet as well.[10]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So what
        is the strategic goal of these publishers? First of all, they want to expand
        their unassailable position in information access to the entire research life
        cycle. This is achieved by contracts such as those concluded by Elsevier in
        the Netherlands, under which researchers can publish open access at no extra
        cost if the universities license Elsevier products in the area of research
        information systems in return.[11] Such contracts are disastrous, because
        it will be immediately clear to all researchers that their research will only
        be properly noted in the next evaluation if it also ends up in the appropriate
        journals. Consequently, the market for both publication and research information
        systems will quickly clear up as a result of this linkage business, and then
        the platform will have moved a step closer to its goal again: namely, that
        it is not science, universities or research funders who determine which research
        is the \u201Cright\u201D one and how much it \u201Ccounts\u201D[12] but rather
        the platform who makes the determination.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such deals seem
        like revenants from the nineties, when, in the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\\\">browser
        wars</a> Microsoft knocked Netscape out of the market by tying Internet Explorer
        to Windows. Another revenant is the behavior of libraries toward OA: if libraries
        had dried up the green road of OA in the nineties by first allowing publishers
        to transform their products and, most importantly, making self archiving worthless
        by signing up for package licenses[13] (which is why the head of SpringerNature
        called package licenses \u201Cthe best invention since sliced bread\u201D[14]),
        now they are once again holding out for publishers, where publishers are having
        their Napster moment through SciHub. By partnering with publishers to commercialize
        open access through publication fees, libraries are trying to crisis-proof
        their business: as long as science governance doesn\u2019t change, scientists
        will have to publish in the appropriate journals, and libraries will prevail
        precisely in the area of accounting and managing publication costs so they
        can continue to justify their staff and budgets. As a result, publication
        fees are already 30 times the actual expenses in some cases[15] \u2013 so
        there is always enough money with the publishers to continue to outspend,
        out-buy, and out-develop big data analytics any alternatives that are developed
        from within the scientific community. And, moreover, DEAL contracts in Germany
        are already beginning to distort competition from publishers in favor of the
        big players on whom the negotiations are focused \u2013 adding even more more
        money to even fewer players.[16]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>New Business Models</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div><figure><figcaption><strong>Figure
        3</strong>: <a href=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/ICE.Arrest_lg.jpg\\\">ICE-Officer
        detaining a suspect\_</a></figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But for
        some players in scholarly communication, this is no longer enough. Thomson
        Reuters and RELX have discovered the global security industry as a buyer of
        their data analytics products, and have signed big data policing contracts
        with law enforcement organizations like\_ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
        (ICE) that use these tools to track immigrants.[17] Since both publishers
        are central providers of specialized legal information, it is therefore not
        at all clear at the moment whether, for example, an attorney who consults
        Westlaw or LexisNexis for guidance on immigration law issues is thereby contributing
        to his or her clients being found and deported.[18] The publishers, of course,
        dismiss it all \u2013 and at the same time continue to escalate the path taken:
        RELX was also an early investor in Palantir, and so the information provided
        by LexisNexis can also be imported and analyzed in Palantir\u2019s analytics
        tools. And since these platforms and tools are sold globally just as the data
        they feed is collected globally, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have to be
        the only ones they\u2019re used against \u2013 the respective interested parties
        can surely think of something \u2013 and library money is supporting these
        systems of surveillance.[19] A scene of revolving-door deals between (semi-)state
        and commercial actors is emerging, where security institutions can get whatever
        they want to know on the market without having to rely any longer on onerous
        rule-of-law tools like obtaining a judicial search warrant. The motto of a
        data broker applies, who, when asked who was actually exchanging data with
        whom, replied: \u201CEveryone with everyone. It\u2019s one[2]\_ big whorehouse.\u201D[20]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So
        where do we stand? We have seen in the past that, due to the special situation
        of the Cold War, the major scientific publishers grew into an early form of
        platform economy, long before the large Internet corporations adapted this
        principle and were thus able to achieve their current position.[21] With their
        work on the Trojans, the publishers are also revealing geopolitical interests,
        namely to cut off entire states from the flow of scientific information, and
        are thus part of a Cold War 4.0.[22] All of this no longer has anything to
        do with scientific progress in knowledge, and so for years we have also had
        to recognize that the publication infrastructures are serving their actual
        purpose less and less. The attention economy of the journals has been analyzed
        time and again in the past[23], but only now, through the replication crisis
        and every glance at <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/\\\">Retraction
        Watch</a>, is it becoming clear how the compulsion for storytelling, the fudging
        of data, and the fight for the smallest publishable unit is destroying and
        corrupting science from within. Leading players in science communication will
        have no problem with this, as Elsevier itself has had half a dozen journals
        in the past that claimed to be peer reviewed but were mere shells rented out
        to pharmaceutical companies to be filled.[24] And the parent company RELX
        engages in political landscaping with donations to climate change deniers
        and to actors who drummed for U.S. withdrawal from WHO.[25] All this can only
        happen almost without contradiction because infrastructure is still a largely
        blind spot in science governance. More and more voices are calling for an
        \u201Cinfrastructural turn\u201D,[26] but even in the welcome European initiatives
        the old mistakes are being made, because in the European Open Science Cloud
        Elsevier has nested[27] just as ORE is run by F1000 Research \u2013 which
        has been bought up by Taylor &amp; Francis.[28]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>So parts
        of the scientific information infrastructures are increasingly moving toward
        the dark money complex, as characterized by the Koch brothers, or even by
        Bob Mercer, whose investment made Cambridge Analytica possible. If you read
        Christopher Wylie\u2019s report on this[29] and compare it with Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s
        analysis of surveillance capitalism[30], you will see that science and antiscience[31]
        are increasingly amalgamating into a confusing tangle, because in the same
        way that this system could not be operated at all without a developed scientific
        education, it is at the same time laying the axe to the foundations of truth,
        enlightenment and social liberties. In discourse, this becomes clear in the
        meteoric rise of half-truths, which are used by conspiracy theorists, politicians,
        economic players, as well as the media \u2013 and more and more scientific
        authors. J\xF6rg Peters recently developed this in his discussion of Stuart
        Ritchie\u2019s \u201CScience Fictions\u201D as a structural problem of an
        information infrastructure that rewards unreplicable research results and
        flushes them to the forefront of attention.[32] Not from the perspective of
        an economist, but of a literary scholar, Nicola Gess analyzes half-truths
        as a technique that no longer operates according to the scheme true/false,
        but according to schemes such as credible/uncredible, affective/sober, and
        connective/closed. What is central, she says, is internal coherence and no
        longer correspondence with external facts. Half-truths, therefore, could no
        longer be resolved with a fact check, but only with a fiction check, which
        highlights how the half-truth builds a narrative around a crystallization
        core of truth while pretending to report facts.[33] We find much of this in
        the corrupted information infrastructures, such as the impossibility for the
        reviewer to follow documents of a 21st century data-driven science to the
        ground of fact within a 17th century publication system with reasonable effort.
        He also has to rely on credibility and internal coherence, and as a consequence,
        subsequently exposed falsifiers like Diederik Stapel resort to the same justification
        phrases as Nicola Gess highlights on the fallen star journalist Claas Relotius.[34]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After
        all \u2013 when we talk about power and power abuse in academia, the information
        infrastructures must not be forgotten. They are in your lab, they are in your
        life, they\u2019re corrupting the truth, they\u2019re selling your ass and
        there is little you can do about it.[35] Nevertheless, it remains the responsibility
        of each individual to reflect on this for their actions in the science system
        and not to blindly accept it, as Tal Yarkoni states in his great rant:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>\u201CWhen
        people start routinely accepting that The System is Broken and The Incentives
        Are Fucking Us Over, bad things tend to happen. It\u2019s very hard to have
        a stable, smoothly functioning society once everyone believes (rightly or
        wrongly) that gaming the system is the only way to get by.\u201D[36]</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming
        the system means, as in any game of chance: the bank always wins. Acting responsibly,
        on the other hand, means supporting and improving existing European initiatives.
        In Germany, this is currently being done, among other things, through the
        National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), which is cooperative and public.
        This path must be expanded, and the mistakes from the literature supply must
        be avoided at all costs. Science will never be happy again as long as the
        big players remain in the game. The success of the NFDI is all the more crucial
        because in the data-driven sciences, data, software and text belong in a common
        context so that results can be verified and immediately developed further.
        For scientists, the current situation is like when a programmer first writes
        his code, then publishes an article about it, and the next programmer tries
        to guess the code from the article and then creates an improved version. Sounds
        highly efficient? And that\u2019s exactly why GitHub exists \u2013 and a trusted,
        powerful and non-buyable version of it would be exactly what science needs.[37]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>And
        before I forget \u2013 there is one more thing you can easily do: join the
        community of scientists who don\u2019t want everything done to them and sign

        though, that paper <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2553-9\\\">is
        retracted</a>.</p>\\n<p>That\u2019s a very rare occurrence for a palaeontology
        paper. And it raises a lot of questions. The retraction notice reads, in full:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We,
        the authors, are retracting this Article to prevent inaccurate information
        from remaining in the literature. Although the description of <em>Oculudentavis
        khaungraae</em> remains accurate, a new unpublished specimen casts doubts
        upon our hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic position of HPG-15-3.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But
        we constantly see papers whose phylogenetic hypotheses are overturned by new
        specimens. We usually deal with this by writing a new paper. Why, in this
        case, is there a retraction? Something smells wrong here.</p>\\n<p>And the
        plot thickens in <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/22/a-big-nature-study-on-a-tiny-dinosaur-is-being-retracted/\\\">Retraction
        Watch\u2019s account</a>: corresponding author Jingmai O\u2019Connor told
        them:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I don\u2019t agree with the retraction but there
        is no point in fighting it, so we all signed it.</p>\\n<p>I cannot say why
        <em>Nature</em> chose to retract, I cannot hypothesize on their inner machinations.
        [\u2026] It is also not that unusual for paleontologists to misidentify things
        and for new information to correct previous hypotheses. However, <em>Nature</em>
        chose not to publish the Matter\u2019s Arising and instead retracts our paper
        \u2013 they must have their reasons.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This doesn\u2019t
        add up. The retraction notice explictly states that the <em>authors</em> retracted
        the original paper \u2014 yet the corresponding author says that the journal
        did it, more or less against the authors\u2019 will.</p>\\n<p>I don\u2019t
        know what\u2019s going on here. I agree with O\u2019Connor that \u201CIt\u2019s
        unfortunate because this way science can\u2019t simply correct itself (as
        it is supposed to do)\u201D. If, as Li et al. (2000) argue, <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        is actually a squamate (lizard), well, fine: they can publish their conclusion,
        and the community will arrive at a consensus as to which identification is
        correct. That\u2019s how it works, right? So why the retraction?</p>\\n<p>And
        there\u2019s more: what does this mean for zoological nomenclature? Is the
        name <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em> still nomenclaturally valid? Opinions
        on this seem to vary (see <a href=\\\"http://dinosaurmailinglist.cmnh.org/2020Jul/threads.html#00156\\\">the
        Dinosaur Mailing List thread beginning with Ben Creisler\u2019s announcement
        of the retraction</a>.)</p>\\n<p>I lean to the interpretation that, since
        the <a href=\\\"https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/\\\">International
        Code on Zoological Nomenclature</a> does not mention retractions, it implicitly
        takes the position that a paper once published is published forever. On that
        basis, the name <em>Oculudentavis</em> remains valid and attached to the holoype
        specimen \u2014 even if that name, with its <em>-avis</em> suffix, proves
        to have been poorly chosen in pertaining to a non-bird. (After all, there
        is plenty of precedent for misleading names staying in place: the whale <em>Basilosaurus</em>
        is not a saurian, and the clade of \u201Cfalse crocodiles\u201D Pseudosuchia
        includes the true crocodiles.)</p>\\n<p>This doesn\u2019t seem to be what
        Springer Nature wants: in a Facebook exchange forwarded to me by a friend
        who I will leave anonymous unless he or she chooses to out him or herself,
        Henry Gee comments \u201CThe retraction means the paper is erased from the
        record, and this includes the name\u201D.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://svpow.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-22-at-5.29.33-pm.png\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>I
        think this is simply incorrect. But I am no expert: I await comments from
        those more versed in the intricacies of the ICZN.</p>\\n<p>At any rate, I
        can\u2019t help but suspect that something is going on here that\u2019s not
        being clearly stated. Could it be to do with the fact that Myanmar amber is
        itself controversial, due to the human rights record of the Myanmar regime?
        Is it even possible that one or more or the authors of the original <em>Oculudentavis</em>
        colluded in describing it as a bird when they knew it was something else?
        I don\u2019t know (and to be 100% clear, I am <em>not</em> accusing anyone
        of anything). But I do know that <em>Nature</em>\u2018s vague and possibly
        misleading retraction notice is not helping, and is not in the spirit of transparency
        that we aim to cultivate in the sciences.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure we
        don\u2019t yet know the full story.</p>\\n<h1>References</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

        29th June 2020, I learned <a href=\\\"https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/\\\">from
        Retraction Watch</a> that Clarivate, the for-profit proprietor of <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122  has newly \u201Csuppressed\u201D   33 journals
        from their indexing service. The immediate consequence of this \u201Csuppression\u201D
        is that these 33 journals do not get assigned an official Clarivate <em>Journal
        Impact Factor</em> \u2122 .  Clarivate justify this action on the basis of
        \u201Canomalous citation patterns\u201D but without much further detail given
        for each of the journals other than the overall \u201C% Self-cites\u201D of
        the journal, and the effect of those self-cites on Clarivate\u2019s citation-based
        ranking of journals (% Distortion of category rank).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amongst
        the 33 journals, I spotted not one but two <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics\\\">systematics</a>
        journals that I know very well:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/\\\">Zootaxa</a>
        <ul><li>published by a small independent publisher \u2018Magnolia Press\u2019
        based in New Zealand</li></ul></li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem\\\">International
        Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a><ul><li>published by
        the Microbiology Society</li><li>the official publication of the\_<a href=\\\"https://www.the-icsp.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes</a>\_and
        the Bacteriology and Applied Microbiology Division of the\_<a href=\\\"https://www.iums.org/\\\"
        target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Union of Microbiological Societies</a></li></ul></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I
        have read, cited, and analysed (textmining and image analysis) articles from
        both of these journals extensively. Chapter 6 of my <a href=\\\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.642021\\\">PhD
        thesis</a> mined over 12,000 <em>Zootaxa</em> articles looking for phylogenetic
        data. In a more <a href=\\\"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e13589\\\">recent
        work published in Research Ideas and Outcomes</a> (RIO Journal), I mined over
        5,800 <em>IJSEM</em> articles for <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\\\">phylogenetic
        tree</a> data. Of relevance, I should also say I was a council member of the
        <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics_Association\\\">Systematics
        Association</a> for many years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the experiences listed
        above, I am therefore very well placed to say that what Clarivate has done
        to these two systematics journals is utter brainless idiocy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        reason why <em>Zootaxa</em> articles cite quite a high proportion of other
        <em>Zootaxa</em> articles is obvious (\u201Cself-citation\u201D at the journal-level
        from Clarivate\u2019s point-of-view) to anyone in the discipline. <em>Zootaxa</em>
        is an important \u2018megajournal\u2019 for the zoological systematics community.
        According to <a href=\\\"https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/list?q=&amp;p=0&amp;n=10&amp;s=_score&amp;d=%2B&amp;f=false&amp;e=false&amp;l=en&amp;authorField=author&amp;dateFilterField=publishedYear&amp;presentation=false&amp;preview=&amp;stemmed=true&amp;useAuthorId=false&amp;sourceTitle.must=Zootaxa&amp;publishedYear.from=2018&amp;publishedYear.to=2019\\\">lens.org
        data</a> Zootaxa published over 5,000 items (articles and monographs) between
        2018 and 2019. Clarivate\u2019s own records from another one of their proprietary
        analytics services called \u2018<a href=\\\"http://www.organismnames.com/metrics.htm?page=tsj\\\">Zoological
        Record</a>\u2018 indicate that 26.57% of all new zoological taxa are published
        in <em>Zootaxa</em>. For  many decades descriptive taxonomy has been pushed-out
        of for-profit journals. <em>Zootaxa</em> is a vital refugia for sound science
        in a poorly funded discipline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The case for legitimate
        \u2018high\u2019 journal-level self-citation at <em>International Journal
        of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> (<em>IJSEM</em>) is even
        clearer and easier to explain. The <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Prokaryotes\\\">International
        Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes</a> (ICNP) <em><strong>requires</strong></em>
        that all new bacteria names are published in IJSEM and nowhere else (a very
        sensible idea which the bacteriology community should be commended for). Hence
        a lot of the systematic and evolutionary microbiology articles in IJSEM will
        cite prior IJSEM articles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> Wayne Maddison has <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WayneMaddison/status/1278773935656407040\\\">commented</a>
        on Twitter that the hardest hit researchers by this action might be those
        in developing countries. I agree. The problem here is that many institutions
        and research funders idiotically use the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 to assess
        the quality of an individual\u2019s research output. In some regimes, if a
        researcher publishes a paper in a journal that has a Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 then it \u2018counts\u2019, whereas if a researcher publishes a paper
        in a journal that has not been given an official Journal Impact Factor \u2122
        by Clarivate then that paper may not \u2018count\u2019 towards the assessment
        of that researcher.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/MoscasFloricola/status/1278515036139520001\\\">zoology
        section of the Chilean Society of Biology</a> has already petitioned Clarivate
        to unsuppress Zootaxa, to give it back its Journal Impact Factor \u2122 .
        I understand why they would do this but I would actually call for something
        quite different and more far-reaching.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I would encourage
        all systematists, taxonomists, zoologists, microbiologists, and biologists
        in general to see the real problem here: Clarivate, a for-profit analytics
        company, should never be so relied-upon by research evaluation committees
        to arbitrarily decide the value of a research output. Especially given that
        the Journal Impact Factor \u2122 is untransparent, <a href=\\\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1083%2Fjcb.200801036\\\">irreproducible</a>,
        and fundamentally <a href=\\\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\\\">statistically
        illiterate</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thus to bring us back to my title. I wonder
        if Clarivate\u2019s wacky \u201Csuppression\u201D might actually be a pathway
        to liberation from the inappropriate stupidity of using Journal Impact Factor
        \u2122 to evaluate individual research outputs. Given we have all now witnessed
        just how brainless some of Clarivate\u2019s decision making is, I would ask
        Clarivate to please \u201Csuppress\u201D all journals thereby removing the
        harmful stupidity of Journal Impact Factor \u2122 from the lives of researchers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/v5rp0-nde12\",\"id\":\"741aaa98-c929-4c12-933c-c09bc151f8e6\",\"image\":\"\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1593770576,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"On

        about the accuser than the supposedly predatory journal at hand. We therefore
        need another way to conceptualise the practices that predatory publishing
        seeks to describe. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The limitations of the term
        are on display in a <a href=\\\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1\\\">preprint</a>
        circulated this week by Severin et al, titled \u2018Who reviews for predatory
        journals? A study on reviewer characteristics\u2019. The study used a review
        tracking service called Publons to identify researchers who have declared
        to have reviewed for journals the authors consider to be predatory. They conclude:
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote><p>[T]he  profiles  of  scholars  who  review
        \ for  predatory journals tend to resemble those scholars who publish their
        research in these outlets: they tend to be young and inexperienced researchers
        who are affiliated with institutions in developing regions. </p><cite>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983155v1.full.pdf
        </cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to the analysis, predatory journals
        both publish the work and rely on the reviewing expertise of the same groups
        of inexperienced researchers based in \u2018developing\u2019 regions. This
        leads the authors to conclude that a possible explanation is that \u2018predatory
        journals have become an integral part of the workflow for many scholars in
        low-and lower-middle income countries\u2019 (p. 8). The kinds of people publishing
        in these journals are demographically similar to those reviewing for them.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The authors base their definition of \u2018predatory\u2019
        on Cabell\u2019s lists, a proprietary database containing journals identified
        as \u2018potentially not following scientific publication standards or expectations
        on quality, peer reviewing, or proper metrics\u2019 (p. 4). The authors make
        it clear that predation is not a \u2018simple binary phenomenon\u2019 and
        that some classified journals may exist in a \u2018grey zone\u2019 between
        predatory and legitimate. As with much humanities/social science research,
        when something isn\u2019t a binary then it is often conceived as a spectrum.
        \  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But the problem with the authors\u2019 strategy is that
        their analysis is still conducted on a binary between predatory and non-predatory,
        rather than a spectrum of questionable practices. Because of course, if the
        authors were to analyse journals along this spectrum, then they would have
        to move outside the list provided by Cabell\u2019s towards all journals too.
        We only have to look at websites like Retraction Watch or various \u2018sting\u2019
        articles to know that bad practice occurs across all forms of publishing,
        not just those identified by Cabell\u2019s, Jeffrey Beall or whoever else
        may have a financial or ideological interest in accusations of predation.
        We may also consider the extractive nature of <a href=\\\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-paid-big-publishers-ps1billion-past-decade\\\">publisher
        profiteering</a> to be a similar kind of bad practice that impacts on the
        quality of the research published. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I\u2019m not in any
        way questioning the author\u2019s motivations with this study (and they recognise
        some of these concerns in a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x\\\"><em>Nature</em>
        story</a> about the article), but just highlighting that the study of bad
        publishing practice cannot be conducted according to whether or not a journal
        is \u2018predatory\u2019. This is especially important as the journals that
        are identified as predatory are most often those from outside the Global North.
        There are always colonial and racial overtones to the analysis of predatory
        publishers that \u2014 consciously or not \u2014 separate them from the \u2018trustworthy\u2019
        outlets in Europe and North America. When, in fact, any study of trustworthiness
        in publishing should not be limited to publishers already identified as \u2018predatory\u2019.
        </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So the term \u2018predatory publisher\u2019 is an aporia:
        the moment you define an organisation as \u2018predatory\u2019 is the moment
        the term collapses and reveals the motivation to decide in advance which publishers
        are good and which are bad (often according to geographical boundaries). But
        this issue cannot be decided in advance \u2014 it is undecidable \u2014 and
        so is continually open to interpretation and shifting context. Either publishing
        is always-already a predatory practice or we have to find a different way
        of analysing trustworthiness. </p>\\n\",\"content_text\":\"content_html\",\"doi\":\"https://doi.org/10.59350/nev8n-gyt51\",\"id\":\"6a317bde-5703-4476-9018-b77c181e688a\",\"image\":\"https://www.samuelmoore.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/adler-2918835_1920-1024x701-1.jpg\",\"language\":\"en\",\"published_at\":1584018889,\"reference\":[],\"relationships\":[],\"summary\":\"The

        />\\n<p>\_</p>\\n<p>What is the most significant piece of published research
        in recent history? One strong candidate is a paper called \u201CIleal-lymphoid-nodular
        hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in
        children\u201D published in 1998. It was written by Andrew Wakefield et al.,
        and postulated a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This article became
        the launching point for the anti-vax movement, which has resulted in (among
        other things) 142,000 deaths from measles in 2019 alone. It has also contributed
        to the general decline of trust in expertise and the rise of fake news.</p>\\n<p>This
        article is now recognised as \u201Cnot just poor science, [but] outright fraud\u201D
        (BMJ). It was eventually retracted \u2014 but it did take its venue of publication
        12 years to do so. Where did it appear? In <em>The Lancet</em>, one of the
        world\u2019s most established and prestigious medical journals, its prestige
        quantified by a stellar Impact Factor of 59.1.</p>\\n<p>How could such a terrible
        paper be published by such a respected journal? Because the venue of its publication
        tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Retractions
        from prestigious venues are not restricted to rogues like Wakefield. Last
        month, Nobel Prize winner Frances Arnold said she was \u201Cbummed\u201D to
        have to retract her 2019 paper on enzymatic synthesis of beta-lactams because
        the results were not reproducible. \u201CCareful examination of the first
        author\u2019s lab notebook then revealed missing contemporaneous entries and
        raw data for key experiments.\u201D she explained. I.e. \u201Coops, we prepared
        the paper sloppily, sooorry!\u201D</p>\\n<p>Prof. Arnold is the first woman
        to be elected to all three National Academies in the USA and has been lauded
        by institutions as diverse as the White House, BBC and the Vatican. She even
        appeared as herself in the TV series, Big Bang Theory. She received widespread
        praise for being so open about having to retract this work \u2014 yet what
        does it say of the paper\u2019s venue of publication, <em>Science</em>? Plainly
        the quality of this paper was not in the least assured by its venue of publication.
        Or to put it another way, the venue of its publication tells us nothing useful
        about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>If we\u2019re going to talk about high-
        and low-prestige venues, we\u2019ll need a ranking system of some sort. The
        obvious ranking system is the Impact Factor \u2014 which, as Clarivate says
        \u201Ccan be used to provide a gross approximation of the prestige of journals\u201D.
        Love it or hate it, the IF has become ubiquitous, and we will reluctantly
        use it here as a proxy for journal prestige.</p>\\n<p>So, then: what does
        \u201Cquality\u201D really mean for a research paper? And how does it relate
        to journal prestige?</p>\\n<p>One answer would be that a paper\u2019s quality
        is to do with its methodological soundness: adherence to best practices that
        make its findings reliable and reproducible. One important aspect of this
        is statistical power: are enough observations made, and are the correlations
        significant enough and strong enough for the results to carry weight? We would
        hope that all reputable journals would consider this crucially important.
        Yet Brembs et al. (2013) found no association between statistical power and
        journal impact factor. So it seems the venue of its publication tells us nothing
        useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>Or perhaps we can define \u201Cquality\u201D
        operationally, something like how frequently a paper is cited \u2014 more
        being good, less being less good, right?. Astonishingly, given that Impact
        Factor is derived from citation counts, Lozano et al. (2012) showed that citation
        count of an individual paper is correlated only very weakly with the Impact
        Factor of the journal it\u2019s published in \u2014 and that correlation has
        been growing yet weaker since 1990, as the rise of the WWW has made discovery
        of papers easier irrespective of their venue. In other words, the venue of
        its publication tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>We
        might at this point ask ourselves whether there is <em>any</em> measurable
        aspect of individual papers that correlates strongly with the Impact Factor
        of the journal they appear in. There is: Fang et al. (2012) showed that Impact
        Factor has a highly significant correlation with the number of retractions
        for fraud or suspected fraud. Wakefield\u2019s paper has been cited 3336 times
        \u2014 did the Lancet know what it was doing by delaying this paper\u2019s
        retraction for so long?<sup>[1]</sup> So maybe the venue of its publication
        does tell us something about the quality of a paper!</p>\\n<p>Imagine if we
        asked 1000 random scholars to rank journals on an \u201Cdegree of excellence\u201D
        scale. <em>Science</em> and <em>The Lancet</em> would, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll
        agree \u2014 like Liverpool\u2019s football team or that one from the \u201Cgreat
        state of Kansas\u201D recently celebrated by Trump \u2014 be placed in the
        journal Premier League. Yet the evidence shows \u2014 both from anecdote and
        hard data \u2014 that papers published in these venues are at least as vulnerable
        to error, poor experimental design and even outright fraud as those in less
        exalted venues.</p>\\n<p>But let\u2019s look beyond journals \u2014 perhaps
        we\u2019ll find a link between quality and venue elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019d
        like to tell you two stories about another venue of publication, this time,
        the World Bank.</p>\\n<p>In 2016, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation
        pledged $5BN to fight AIDS in Africa. Why? Well, it was all down to someone
        at the World Bank having the bright idea to take a copy of their latest report
        on AIDS in Africa to Seattle and pitch the findings and recommendations directly
        to Mr Gates. I often tell this story as an example of impact. I think we can
        agree that the quality of this report must have been pretty high. After all,
        it unlocked $5BN for a good cause. But, of course, you\u2019re thinking \u2014
        D\u2019oh! It\u2019s a World Bank report, it must be high-quality. Really?</p>\\n<p>Consider
        also this story: in 2014, headlines like this lit up around the world: \u201CLiterally
        a Third of World Bank Policy Reports Have Never, Ever Been Read Online, By
        Anyone\u201D (<em>Slate</em>) and \u201CWorld Bank learns most PDFs it produces
        go unread\u201D (<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>). These headlines were triggered
        by a working paper, written by two economists from the World Bank and published
        on its website. The punchline? They were wrong, the paper was very wrong.
        Like Prof. Arnold\u2019s paper they were \u201Cmissing contemporaneous entries
        and raw data\u201D, in this case data from the World Bank\u2019s official
        repository. They\u2019d pulled the data from an old repository. If they had
        also used data from the Bank\u2019s new repository they\u2019d have found
        that every Bank report, however niche, had been downloaded many times. How
        do I know? Because I called the one guy who would know the truth, the Bank\u2019s
        Publisher, Carlos Rossel, and once he\u2019d calmed down, he told me.</p>\\n<p>So,
        we have two reports from the same venue: one plainly exhibiting a degree of
        excellence, the other painfully embarrassing (and, by the way, it still hasn\u2019t
        been retracted).</p>\\n<p>Now, I bet you\u2019re thinking, the latter is a
        working paper, therefore it hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed and so it doesn\u2019t
        count. Well, the Aids in Africa report wasn\u2019t \u201Cpeer reviewed\u201D
        either \u2014 in the sense we all understand \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop
        Gates reaching for his Foundation\u2019s wallet. What about all the preprints
        being posted on BiorXiv and elsewhere about the Coronavirus: do they \u201Cnot
        count\u201D? This reminds me of a lovely headline when Cern\u2019s paper on
        the discovery of the Higgs Boson finally made it into a journal some months
        after the results had been revealed at a packed seminar, and weeks after the
        paper had been posted on arXiv: \u201CHiggs boson discovery passes peer review,
        becomes actual science\u201D. Quite apart from the irony expressed by the
        headline writer, here\u2019s a puzzler for you. Was the quality of this paper
        assured by finally being published in a journal (with an impact factor one-tenth
        of <em>Science</em>\u2019s), or when it was posted in arXiv, or when it was
        presented at a seminar? Which venue assured the quality of this work?</p>\\n<p>Of
        course, none of them did because the venue of its publication tells us nothing
        about the quality of the paper. The quality is inherent in the paper itself,
        not in the venue where it is made public.</p>\\n<p>Wakefield paper\u2019s
        lack of quality was also inherent in the paper itself and that it was published
        in <em>The Lancet</em> (and is still available on more than seventy websites)
        did not mean it was high quality. Or to put it another way, the venue of its
        publication tells us nothing useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<p>So
        what are different venues good for? Today\u2019s scholarly publishing system
        is still essentially the same as the one that Oldenburg et al started in the
        17th Century. This system evolved in an environment when publishing costs
        were significant and grew with increased dissemination (increased demand meant
        higher print and delivery costs). This meant that editors had to make choices
        to keep costs under control \u2014 to select what to publish and what to reject.
        The selection criteria varied: some used geography to segment the market (<em>The
        Chinese Journal of X</em>, <em>The European Journal of Y</em>); some set up
        societies (<em>Operational Research Society Journal</em>) and others segmented
        the market by discipline (<em>The International Journal of Neurology</em>).
        These were genuinely useful distinctions to make, helping guide authors, readers
        and librarians to solutions for their authoring, reading and archiving needs.</p>\\n<p>Most
        journals pretend to use quality as a criterion to select within their niche
        \u2014 but isn\u2019t it funny that there isn\u2019t a <em>Quality Journal
        of Chemistry</em> or a <em>Higher-Quality Journal of Physics</em>? The real
        reasons for selection and rejection are of course to do with building brands
        and meeting business targets in terms of the number of pages published. If
        quality was the overarching criteria, why, like the wine harvest, don\u2019t
        journals fluctuate in output each year? Down when there\u2019s a poor-season
        and up when the sun shines?</p>\\n<p>If quality was the principle reason for
        acceptance and rejection, why is it absent from the list of most common reasons
        for rejection? According to Editage one of the most common reasons is because
        the paper didn\u2019t fit the aims and scope of the journal. Not because the
        paper is of poor quality. The current publishing process isn\u2019t a system
        for weeding out weak papers from prestige journals, leaving them with only
        the best. It\u2019s a system for sorting stuff into \u201Chouses\u201D which
        is as opaque, unaccountable and random as the Sorting Hat which confronted
        Harry Potter at Hogwarts. This paper to the <em>Journal of Hufflepuff</em>;
        that one to the <em>Journal of Slytherin</em>!</p>\\n<p>So the venue of its
        publication can tell us useful things about a paper: its geographical origin,
        its field of study, the society that endorses it. The one thing it can\u2019t
        tell us is anything useful about the quality of a paper.</p>\\n<h1>Note</h1>\\n<p>[1]
        We regret this phrasing. We asked \u201Cdid the Lancet know what it was doing\u201D
        in the usual colloquial sense of implying a lack of competence (\u201Che doesn\u2019t
        know what he\u2019s doing\u201D); but as Niall Boyce rightly pointed out,
        it can be read as snidely implying that <em>The Lancet</em> knew <em>exactly</em>
        what it was doing, and deliberately delayed the retraction in order to accumulate
        more citations. For avoidance of doubt, that is not what we meant; we apologise
        for not having written more clearly.</p>\\n<h1>References</h1>\\n<p>We were
        of course not able to give references during the debate. But since our statement
        included several citations, we can remedy that deficiency here.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

        CSSE</p></div>\\n<p>At the start of the Year of the Mouse, the world is experiencing
        an outbreak of a new Coronavirus, for now, called 2019-nCoV. As of February
        4th (<a href=\\\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\\\">source
        JHU CSSE dashboard</a>)<sup>,</sup> there are 20,679 confirmed cases and 427
        fatalities. Nearly 99% of the cases have been reported in China mostly in
        Hubei Province; and all except two reported fatalities have occurred in Mainland
        China. All the initial cases came from the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei,
        in Central China, but the origin of the virus is unknown. The case fatality
        rate (fatalities/total cases, CFR), based on reported data has been declining
        from nearly 3% to 2% as more data has become available, but is less than 2%
        in China, outside of Hubei. This is considerably lower than SARS (9.6%)<sup>1</sup>
        and MERS (9-36%)<sup>2</sup></p>\\n<p>The first full-length reference genome
        for the virus was deposited in <a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2\\\">GENBANK
        as NC_045512</a> by scientists at Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and referred
        to as the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus, as many of the initial cases
        were linked to a market of seafood and animals in the city of Wuhan. Multiple
        additional complete genomes have been deposited in GENBANK by the researchers
        within China and internationally including the US Centers for Disease Control
        (CDC). Additional isolates (62 in total at the time of posting) have been
        <a href=\\\"https://www.gisaid.org\\\">deposited in GISAID</a>, a public repository
        of influenza virus sequences . Variation and evolution of the virus are being
        followed by an open-sourced project tracking pathogen evolution, <a href=\\\"https://nextstrain.org/\\\">Nextstrain</a>.
        To date, the virus has shown few variable sites and low diversity.</p>\\n<div><img

        is most closely related to a beta-coronavirus isolated in bats in Yunnan<sup>3,4</sup>
        \_(<a href=\\\"https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/sars-like-cov\\\">MG772933</a>),
        and all the current isolates found in China or other countries are very closely
        related (Figure 2). The sequence data suggests that there was a single zoonotic
        event of viral transmission into the human population. Phylogenetic analysis
        places 2019-nCoV in the sarbecovirus subgenus that includes the SARS virus.<sup>3</sup>
        \_Three prereprints in bioRxiv describe data indicating that the virus uses
        the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) protein as its cellular receptor<sup>5-7</sup>,
        as does SARS.<sup>8</sup> \_This result is significant as the Middle East
        respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, MERS-CoV, uses dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4;
        also known as CD26) as its receptor.<sup>9</sup> To date, there is no variation
        in the portion of the virus that binds to ACE2<sup>6</sup>.</p>\\n<div><img

        the clinical features of 41 infected cases, 6 of whom died, and their demographic
        and clinical features.<sup>10</sup> An estimate of 7 days from onset of symptoms
        to hospital admission was presented. The second description of 99 cases has
        also been published<sup>11</sup> along with reports documenting human-human
        transmission.<sup>3,4</sup> \_A third study of 425 cases provided an estimate
        of the mean incubation time of 5.2 days and a basic reproductive number of
        2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).<sup>11</sup> At the time of writing, current estimates
        of the case fatality rate (CFR) for 2019-nCoV are between 2 and 3 (<strong>Table
        1</strong>). However, in regions of China outside of Hubei only 11 out of
        6125 have died (0.18%). The first case report of a 35-year old male in the
        US described mild to moderate symptoms, and a virus with one one amino acid
        difference in one protein from the reference.<sup>12</sup> There has been
        considerable cooperation among international health organizations, with the
        CDC publishing the details of a <a href=\\\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/guidance-laboratories.html\\\">real-time
        PCR diagnostic test</a>, and the World Health Organization has a site for
        <a href=\\\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf?sfvrsn=bc7da517_2&amp;download=true\\\">up-to-date
        clinical treatment guidelines</a>.</p>\\n<p>In conclusion there is still rapid
        growth of 2019-nCoV infections in Hubei Province, with a slowly declining
        fatality rate, but much fewer deaths outside of this region. Genetic and biological
        data is being rapidly produced and disseminated allowing for the rapid development
        of diagnostic tests and development of vaccines and other therapeutics.</p>\\n<p><strong>We
